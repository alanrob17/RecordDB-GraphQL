		"review": "<p>With the list of contenders vying for the ‘Australian Blues album of the Year’ seemingly growing each week, Melbourne’s Geoff Achison has thrown his hat in the ring, with the release of “Sovereign Town”, a collection of 12 songs, which are inspired by the gold rush in Victoria, around the 1850’s.  The album was recorded in Ballarat, a town steeped in gold mining history and part of the “Golden Triangle”, close to where Achison grew up. He recalls the area and remembers exploring the old diggings, when he was a kid, so this is almost a revisit to those childhood memories and his journey through life and as a musician.</p><p>For this album, Geoff has eased off the tempo and rocking blues we are somewhat used to with his Souldiggers band, delivering an album of mostly chilled out, easy listening solo work which would suit any lazy afternoon, with sun blazing down and a nice bottle of red breathing in the sea breeze – well that how I’ve been listening to it and it works a treat!  For me personally, it’s been a difficult album to review because a lot of the attraction to this is in the lyrics, and to delve deeper into that I would need to break each track down in real detail – so I’ll leave that for you to explore & enjoy.</p><p>So, onto the music, and we start with a simple percussion & double bass intro which leads us into the opening track ‘Skeleton Kiss’, with Geoff’s gravel-like vocals and mellow acoustic guitar playing setting the tone for the album.  ‘Miniature Men’ & ‘Walk Away’ continue the relaxed rhythm, as we ebb & flow along with Geoff.  The title track ‘Sovereign Town’ picks the pace up ever so slightly with some beautiful finger picking acoustic work.  ‘Wandsworth Bridge’ is a track full of lyrics of lost loves and heartbreak, with a wonderful gentle electric solo in the middle.  ‘Misha Bella’ takes us on an almost jazz-blues trip, with some incredible guitar work once more and jazz club drum beat and Hammond Organ-like keys.  The album takes a completely different turn with the upbeat ‘Small Town Crime’, which caught me by surprise – pleasantly I may add – as I was “in the zone” so to speak, but I was soon back there with the outstanding ‘World of Blue’, one of my favourites on the album, with its haunting slide guitar apparent throughout the track.  ‘Sleepwalking’ is another one of my favourites and it’s so great to hear Geoff being able to display his outstanding acoustic work throughout, without the temptation to “rock it up” at any time on the album.  The beautiful instrumental track ‘Hand of Faith’ displays some almost Spanish-like acoustic guitar playing (I even opened a bottle of Rioja at this point), before ‘Rescue the Past’ pulls us back with a slightly quicker tempo with nice chorus and slide solo work.  The album closes with ‘Coolbardie Sunrise’, another instrumental that showcases Geoff’s amazing finger picking talents, which is played on his “Regal” resonator.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Bennett</strong><p>"

		"review": "<p>As Whiskeytown finally ground to a halt in the wake of an astonishing number of personal changes following Faithless Street (coupled with record company problems that kept their final album, Pneumonia, from reaching stores until two years after it was recorded), Ryan Adams ducked into a Nashville studio for two weeks of sessions with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. While arch traditionalists Welch and Rawlings would hardly seem like a likely match for alt-country's bad boy, the collaboration brought out the best in Adams; Heartbreaker is loose, open, and heartfelt in a way Whiskeytown's admittedly fine albums never were, and makes as strong a case for Adams' gifts as anything his band ever released. With the exception of the Stones-flavored \"Shakedown on 9th Street\" and the swaggering \"To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High),\" Heartbreaker leaves rock & roll on the shelf in favor of a sound that blends low-key folk-rock with a rootsy, bluegrass-accented undertow, and while the album's production and arrangements are subtle and spare, they make up in emotional impact whatever they lack in volume. As a songwriter, Adams concerns himself with the ups and downs of romance rather than the post-teenage angst that dominated Whiskeytown's work, and \"My Winding Wheel\" and \"Damn, Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains)\" are warmly optimistic in a way he's rarely been before, while \"Come Pick Me Up\" shows he's still eloquently in touch with heartbreak. Adams has always been a strong vocalist, but his duet with Emmylou Harris on \"Oh My Sweet Carolina\" may well be his finest hour as a singer, and the stripped-back sound of these sessions allows him to explore the nooks and crannies of his voice, and the results are pleasing. Whiskeytown fans who loved the \"Replacements-go-twang\" crunch of \"Drank Like a River\" and \"Yesterday's News\" might have a hard time warming up to Heartbreaker, but the strength of the material and the performances suggest Adams is finally gaining some much-needed maturity, and his music is all the better for it.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p><hr/><p>Remember when Ryan Adams released Heartbreaker* *and confused diehards wondered what happened to the *real Ryan Adams? You know, the lovable fuck-up who made alt-country sound dangerous, *lived the words of \"Waiting to Derail\" and needed no assistance breaking his own heart? If this scenario sounds too remote, just sub out *Heartbreaker *for \"basically *anything *Ryan Adams has done in the 21st century.\" Of course, none of those things have achieved the sterling reputation of *Heartbreaker, which makes the album seem like the least interesting choice for a reissue: *aren't *Rock N Roll and 29 *better conversation-starters? But maybe Adams isn't expecting another round of exaltations with this deluxe repackage: In fact, bundling it with a bunch of wearable merch (i.e., \"exclusive 3-inch Heartbreaker patch\") might be more a sly commentary on its supposed \"authenticity\"—even it still towers over Adams' solo work, it's no more *real *than 1989**.</p><p>The myth of *Heartbreaker *as the realest breakup album ever starts to fall apart the minute you press play: it is certainly the saddest record to contain the line, \"a mouth full of cookies,\" however. \"(Argument with David Rawlings Concerning Morrissey)\" presents Ryan Adams as what he's repeatedly proven to be in the years since—a hilarious trivia nerd and musical advocate. It's an important part of what makes Ryan Adams Ryan Adams, and the source from which we were given *1984, *the Extra Cheese EP, his long-rumored banjo and mandolin cover of *Is This It?, *and his prog-metal odyssey *Orion. *However, it's the first and maybe last time he could be that guy without feeling like he was *trying *to make a point. Back then, there was no construct of Ryan Adams, and this presumably *in media res *debate snippet was an effective way for him to establish an identity on his solo debut.</p><p>More importantly, it's an argument concerning Morrissey—not Gram Parsons, not Bob Dylan, not Paul Westerberg. The influence of the Smiths would fully manifest on Adams' Love Is Hell, and the inclusion of a \"Hairdresser on Fire Jam\" demo in the bonus material here suggests that maybe his maligned bedsit opus has more in common with *Heartbreaker *than we think. Either way, it's an important artistic allegiance, linking Adams and Morrissey as the rare artists who can recognize the inherent absurdity in exchanging performative sadness for adoration.</p><p>After all, a truly inconsolable song couldn't possibly be given a title like \"To Be Young (Is To Be Sad, Is To Be High).\" On it, Adams appears more wise and empathetic than young and sad; note that it's sung in the past tense. Like so much of *Heartbreaker, *its focus isn't misery, but nostalgia—its inclusion during the opening credits of Old School, a comedy suffused with longing for a simple forms of self-destructive behavior, made its flexibility all the more apparent. It's a song that Adams plays at nearly every one of his shows, not to commiserate with the crowd, but to celebrate a past time when its linear logic made all the sense in the world. Think of it as Adams' \"Rubber Ring,\" an open invitation to fondly remember that time when you relied on a fucked-up guy like him to save your life.</p><p>The introduction is an outlier, though—would Heartbreaker be held in the same regard if it was just wistful folk-rock like \"My Winding Wheel?\" Even though \"AMY\" outright names the supposed inspiration behind *Heartbreaker *and is the most striking stylistic divergence from Whiskeytown (prior to the experimental Pneumonia), an album of weeping, floral psychedelia might have been too much, too soon. Though Adams claims that the titling of *Heartbreaker *was a last-second decision made while staring at a Mariah Carey poster, *Heartbreaker is Heartbreaker *for the times it allows the listener sees themselves in its own album cover—prostrate, staring at the ceiling, half-hoping that cigarette drops onto their bed so they can feel something different.</p><p>Despair alone never accounted for *Heartbreaker'*s unusual resonance. It isn't the most dire or confessional account of bad romance; its language is not the most clever. There are all kinds of odd tangents, character is frequently broken, and it's probably a few songs longer than it really needs to be. *Heartbreaker *isn't a tidy narrative or song cycle about relationships anyways; otherwise, how to explain the inclusion of the barroom brawl \"Shakedown on 9th Street\" or the Dylan goof \"Damn Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains)?\" Even \"In My Time of Need\" isn't actually about *Ryan Adams' *time of need and certainly inapplicable to a broken relationship between an up-and-coming rock star and a music publicist; it's pretty much a Whiskeytown-style character study about rural financial distress (\"I work these hands to bleed, cause I got mouths to feed/and I got $15 hid above the stove\").</p><p>No, the power of this album, and the reason it reminds its devotees too much of him, or her, or a past version of themselves, can be found in \"Come Pick Me Up.\" \"Come Pick Me Up\" is the that ends most of Adams' concerts these days and probably will for the rest of his career. On a basic level, it could slot alongside petulant, scorned-dude screeds like \"Song for the Dumped\" or Kanye West's \"Heartless;\" it is about a woman who seemingly fucked him over. But the most important lyric isn't the one about this is the kind of person who would steal your records and screw your friends without the slightest remorse. It's \"*I wish you would\"—*the point of \"Come Pick Me Up\" is not to marvel at this person's monstrosity and project it outwards. It's to see yourself in Ryan Adams and remember every single time you've allowed yourself to get fucked over and even worse, sought it out.</p><p>In every repetition of \"I wish you would,\" Adams underlines not just the appeal of Heartbreaker, but most breakup albums in general. On some level, they make no evolutionary sense: life is hard enough, why would anyone be drawn to music that lets you relive your most miserable moments? Yeah, there's jokes and asides and times where Heartbreaker rocks, but those defense mechanisms malfunction on \"Call Me on Your Way Back Home\" when Adams sings, \"oh, I just wanna die without you\" and it sure as hell sounds like the truth.</p><p>Maybe you wanna die. But you didn't. And that's OK. Like Morrissey, or really any singer-songwriter worth hearing on the topic, Adams doesn't see the occasional heartbreak as a terminal fate, but an essential part of the human condition. In closing one of his performances captured on 2015's Live at Carnegie Hall**, Adams yells, \"THAT'S IT! YOU'RE SAD NOW!!! NOW YOU'RE SAD!!! EVERYBODY'S SAD NOW! YEAAAAHHH!!!!\"  Everyone gets the joke. \"Come Pick Me Up\" isn't miserable; like Heartbreaker, it's actually enjoyable knowing you can hit bottom for 50 minutes and still appreciate the view.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Steven Byrd, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

If one believes what they read in New Musical Express, Adams cut about four albums' worth of material during sessions with various musicians and producers within the space of a year (not even counting the much talked about but to date unheard four-track recordings of blues versions of all the songs from the Strokes' debut disc, <I>Is This It?</I>).</p><p>Sensibly enough, Adams and his record company decided that releasing such a huge flood of material wasn't in the best interest of either artist or label, and instead Adams cherry-picked these sessions into a 13-track collection, <I>Demolition</I>. Appropriately enough, <I>Demolition</I> sounds less like \"the third Ryan Adams album\" than a collection of stray tunes — some of which are very good, especially the lazy summer vibe of \"Tennessee Sucks,\" the up-tempo acoustic twang of \"Chin Up, Cheer Up,\" the winsome \"Cry on Demand,\" and the heading-off-the-rails rocker \"Starting to Hurt.\" But more than a few of the other songs on the album sound like rough drafts rather than completed works, and <I>Demolition</I> seems to lack a strong thematic or structural center.</p><p>In short, <I>Demolition</I> sounds like a bunch of demos, which of course is just what it is, and while it preserves a few strong tunes and offers an insight into Adams' creative process, it also makes clearthat even the rising wunderkind of Americana can benefit from a bitof judicious editing and polishing.</p><p> &mdash; <strong>Mark Deming, AllMusic</strong></p><hr/><p>It's been just under a year (365 days to be exact - but this year was a leap year) since Ryan Adams released <EM>Gold</EM>, the album by which he truly broke into the mainstream music collective. Over this time Adams has gone from former-Whiskeytown frontman to having his \"New York\" become an anthem for the 9/11 attacks, and having his \"When The Stars Go Blue\" be performed live by The Corrs with Bono. Now that's quite a year for countrified folk-rocker.</p><P>During this time (and in the time before) Adams also managed to record a crapload of demos. Originally toying with the idea of releasing these 60 tracks over four discs, his label (luckily) opted to trim these down to thirteen - the results of which being <EM>Demolition</EM>. (Get it? \"Demo\"-lition? Pretty clever, eh?)</p><P>Anyway, <EM>Demolition</EM> follows in a much similar vein as <EM>Gold</EM>, and given the quality, could have rightly been <EM>Gold</EM>'s true follow-up. As is usual with Adams, the high points are many, but are most prevalent on the album's lighter moments. The simple piano and guitar of \"Cry On Demand\" and the tongue-in-cheek lyrical balladry of \"Tennesee Sucks\" offer Adams at his most impressive. The Smiths-rock of \"Starting to Hurt,\" doesn't fare too badly either. The minimalist depression of the closing \"Jesus (Don't Touch My Baby),\" however, is one of Adams finest (and bravest) moments<EM>ever</EM>.</p><P>Still, it's not all praises of glory for Adams. As a set of what's really just a bunch of outtakes, there are the inevitable bombs. The opening \"Nuclear\" shows why Adams is not really a <EM>rock</EM> star: he just can't rock out that well. The guitar riff of \"Dear Chicago\" bears a striking similarity to Dog's Eye View (remember them?), and that's just not all that cool.</p><hr/><p>Whenever I voice my concerns about Ryan Adams to friends, they cringe in preparation for a misdirected, elitist screed about the dangers of selling out-- just as you may be doing right now. So let me be upfront: I'm happy for the guy. I don't have any personal issues with him, nor do I think he's committed any brazen acts of treason toward the music community at large.</p><p>Adams has been grooming himself for rock star status for a very long time, without an ounce of subtlety. In fact, he was qualified from the very beginning, when his band Whiskeytown signed with DGC subsidiary Outpost Recordings. If anything, he's overqualified now: he's prolific, talented, and cocksure, and he's got the kind of apple-cheeked, midwestern good looks (and jean-jacket) that suggest rural summer nights spent listening to \"Pink Houses\". Even before Winona, Alanis, Elton John duets, Gap commercials, MTV specials, and the incredibly fortuitous and profitable coup of releasing Gold, with its flag-bedecked cover art and single \"New York\" mere weeks after 9/11, he was as good as in.</p><p>Gold, though, was a disappointment to many longtime fans, not because he was suddenly the very definition of mainstream success but because it simply couldn't hold a candle to its predecessor, 2000's stunning Heartbreaker. And yet, as uneven, flawed, and possibly symptomatic of megalomania as Gold may have been, it increased Adams' celebrity tenfold. No longer consigned to Sunday morning fodder for sentimental hipsters, alt-country purists, and aging public radio DJs hunting for latest reincarnation of Gram Parsons, Adams became so very famous that both of my parents now own at least one of his albums-- and that, ladies and gentlemen, is saying quite a lot.</p><p>I once offered up the observation that Ryan Adams would be capable of churning out some of the most solid, affecting music around were he contained in a room and limited to a four-track and the fewest possible instruments. Demolition should, by all rights, be that project. Demos hold the promise of the understated songs I've always wanted to believe Adams left off his bombastic, overwrought last offering. Given what it is, though, Demolition is awfully slick. And while not, in theory, a follow-up to Gold, it's clear from the record's first track, \"Nuclear\", a radio-friendly hybrid of New Nashville and jangly college pop, that Adams intends for this record to be more than just a modest, for-the-fans compilation.</p><p>The swaggering, AM-dial rock 'n' roll of Gold is recalled in \"Gimme a Sign\", a wide-open space-rocker carried off with satisfactorily crunchy guitar that gets bonus points for the Byrdsian flourishes of Rickenbacker in the choruses. But \"The Pink Hearts\", recorded with Adams' touring band, falters, and despite its roughhewn affectations, sounds mysteriously clean for a purported demo. The ballads, thankfully, fare a bit better. The Nick Drake-flavored \"You Will Always Be the Same\" features sparse accompaniment from an acoustic guitar, cello, and light percussion. Lyrically, it's pretty straightforward, and it's also one of the few tracks here on which Adams is content to be himself, rather than imitating his influences. Likewise, the near-elegiac \"Tomorrow\" features one of most subtle and perfect harmonies I've heard recently, and despite its faulty sequencing (it really ought to have been the closer), it's by far the album's best song.</p><p>Of course, while Demolition forgoes the overproduction and even much of the shameless rock-god posturing that plagued Gold, Adams hasn't yet found his way out of his songwriting rut. This, perhaps, could be attributed to the nature of the record, since artists tend to save their best material for their official releases. But both the harmonica-driven \"Hallelujah\" and the highly polished \"Cry on Demand\", sound strikingly like many of the misfires that haunted Gold. Elsewhere, the pickin' n' grinnin' \"Chin Up, Cheer Up\" is a none-too-subtle rehash of Heartbreaker's \"Winding Wheel\". Such is the cost of prolificacy-- you can only write so many songs before they all begin to sound alike.</p><p>Now, Ryan Adams is no stranger to wearing his influences on his sleeve, and it seems like the harder rocking tracks on Demolition want to suggest a punker spirit, despite that, for the most part, it sounds as if he's traded in his Replacements LPs for John Cougar Mellencamp. Still, it's possible that Adams may overcome the somewhat pandering nature of his last two albums to release his best work to date, provided he can rediscover his muse and find a producer that better suits his music. Talent, after all, doesn't just evaporate. And despite all my bitterness at having to stare at Adams' smug, airbrushed glare every time I drive past The Gap on Franklin Street, I like to think he might end up being more than just the guy who used to write good songs.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Alison Fields, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Love Is Hell was intended to be the official follow-up to 2001's Gold -- the album that was not a collection of demos (that was 2002's Demolition), or the recorded-but-shelved albums 48 Hours or The Suicide Handbook, or even his alleged song-by-song cover of the Strokes' Is This It. Longtime Smiths fan that he is, Adams teamed up with John Porter -- the man who produced The Smiths, Meat Is Murder, and part of The Queen Is Dead -- with the intention of creating his own mope-rock album, hence the title Love Is Hell.

Eventually, a compromise was arranged: Adams kicked out a new album, the self-descriptive Rock N Roll, while releasing the equally self-descriptive Love Is Hell as two EPs, the first hitting the streets the same day as the \"official\" album, the second arriving a month later. Five months after that, the full-length Love Is Hell, containing both EPs plus \"Anybody Wanna Take Me Home\" from Rock N Roll, was released, negating the worth of the individual EPs (which were, after all, merely two halves of one album) and likely irritating legions of fans who bought both EPs.</p><p>While it took longer than necessary to have the whole bloody affair of Love Is Hell released as its own entity, it's hard not to view it as a companion piece to Rock N Roll, particularly because they're two sides of the same coin. In effect, both Rock N Roll and Love Is Hell are tribute albums, each a conscious aping of a style and sound, both designed to showcase how versatile and masterful Adams is. But since he's a synthesist more than a stylist, Adams, for all his bluster, winds up as a Zelig-styled character, taking on the characteristics of the artists he's emulating -- something that can be sonically pleasurable, but far from being the substantive work of mad genius that he relentlessly sells himself as. If Love Is Hell has the edge over Rock N Roll, it's because it's more carefully considered in its production and writing, and he manages to hide his allusions better than he does on Rock, where every title and chord progression plays like an homage. Here, he shoots for the Smiths and winds up in Jeff Buckley territory tempered with a dash of Radiohead circa The Bends. To claim that it is a dark affair is to criticize its milieu more than its substance, because the songs have the form and feel of brooding, atmospheric mope-rock, not the blood and guts of the music. Adams is fairly adept at crafting that mood -- anybody who's such a fan of rock history should be -- sometimes relying more on a blend of attitude and atmosphere instead of songwriting. Such is the fate of a stylized tribute to a style with specific sonic attributes, but Adams also does come up with a clutch of effective songs: the epic sprawl of \"Political Scientist,\" which captures him at his best Buckley; the title track, which is nearly anthemic with its ringing guitars; the understated \"World War 24\"; the gently propulsive \"This House Is Not for Sale,\" which would fit nicely between a Julian Cope and Morrissey track on a college radio show from the late '80s. \"English Girls Approximately\" is an effective Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg fusion, and the closer, \"Hotel Chelsea Nights,\" is one of his best songs, a mildly anthemic soulful anthem with vague overtones of \"Purple Rain.\" Nevertheless, it's telling that the best song here is a cover of Oasis' \"Wonderwall.\" It's a well-done cover but not much of a reinvention -- Adams uses Noel Gallagher's solo acoustic version of the song as a template, replacing strumming with fingerpicked guitars and altering the phrasing slightly -- which is why the song itself shines through so strongly: it resonates how the other songs are intended to, but don't. While it doesn't fatally hurt Love Is Hell, since it is an effective mood piece, it does undercut it, revealing how Adams delivers the sizzle but not the steak.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

While it doesn't fatally hurt Love Is Hell, since it is an effective mood piece, it does undercut it, revealing how Adams delivers the sizzle but not the steak.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>If anyone out there is still wondering just how Ryan Adams can be so prolific, maybe it's because the urgency of his situation compels him to strike while the iron is hot. It took his former band, Whiskeytown, seven years to release a trio of critically revered albums, and his first solo record, 2000's Heartbreaker, was in the works for half that. But when Heartbreaker saw release, and was promptly met with virtually unanimous critical praise, Adams clearly became inspired and quickly turned out sixteen new tracks for a sophomore record&mdash;the rushed, overproduced Gold&mdash;which came with a bonus disc sporting five tracks in the more stripped vein of the album's predecessor. And when that album scored Adams a commercial alternative radio hit in the well-timed \"New York, New York\", he descended into a recording fervor that continues, unabated, to this day.</p><p>Irrational outbursts and public meltdowns aside, Adams is, at heart, an extremely gifted songwriter who just doesn't realize that what he really needs is to take a deep breath and slow the fuck down. During the course of the past two years, he's released a collection of demos (Demolition), and a 21-track side project called The Finger with ex-D Generation frontman Jesse Malin (the \"double-album\" We Are Fuck You/Punk's Dead Let's Fuck). He's currently planning a box set titled Career Ender, which will be crammed with five discs of the songs he's discarded since Gold dropped two years ago. And that's not even taking into account the four-tracked blues version of The Strokes' album Is This It that he's said to have recorded. Did I mention his collaborations with Beth Orton and Emmylou Harris? How about the track he co-wrote for the Counting Crows? His session work with Lucinda Williams and Alejandro Escovedo? His production work on Jesse Malin's solo album? I think you get the point. The question is: why doesn't he?</p><p>Adams originally intended Love Is Hell as his official third full-length, but his label, Lost Highway, scoffed when he handed in the tapes. Initially, he planned to rework it, but then agreed to dashing off a glossy, radio-friendlier full-length (the disasterous Rock N Roll), provided the label would also make room on their release schedule for a secondary release for Love Is Hell. It's easy to see why Lost Highway balked: an insincere, smugly posturing Ryan Adams who lives up to his stage persona by creating an album like Rock N Roll simply had to have been preferable to the miserable, slobbering woe-is-me shtick he plays up here. At least when he was wearing the proverbial alt-country tag, his balancing act of conceitedness and overemoting was halfway convincing. Unfortunately, just as the caricature-laden excesses of Rock N Roll aped garage-rockers and postmortem Rock Hall of Famers, Love Is Hell reaches for the dripping, maudlin sentimentality of Rufus Wainwright or a mock Jeff Buckley.</p><p>It's a shock, given that the press surrounding the Love Is Hell sessions had pegged the record as Adams' return to the sparse, two-in-the-morning flair of his debut&mdash;and when Lost Highway postponed the recordings, calling them \"too dark,\" it only heightened the expectations of optimistic fans hoping for a stark, brooding future classic. Of course, it did seem something of an enigma as well: Adams' music, after all, had always faired best with pared-down arrangements making room for his own brand of confessional singer/songwriter groveling (e.g. Heartbreaker standouts \"Call Me on Your Way Back Home\" and \"Come Pick Me Up\"); shelving Ryan Adams for being too dark seemed to make about as much sense as shelving Kraftwerk for being too German.</p><p>But while it's safe to say that these EPs are certainly dark&mdash;at least in contrast to Rock N Roll and even parts of Gold&mdash;they fail to capture the striking imagery and confident vocals of which Adams seemed a master on Heartbreaker. For example, Love Is Hell's opening, piano-led \"Political Scientist\", replaces Adams' confessional, first-person narratives with a third-person tale that indicts the government for supplying cocaine, and candy factories for poisoning the environment. Conspiracy theories aside, playing Greenpeace spokesman is not Adams' strong suit; he attempts the political profundity of a Thom Yorke and comes off like a diet Chris Martin.</p><p>And if Adams fails to adopt Yorke's political relevance, he'll settle for the Radiohead frontman's melismatics&mdash;Love Is Hell is riddled with Adams' unabashed aping of Yorke's signature fragmented lyrical style. On the lethargic lite-country stomp of \"This House Is Not for Sale\", Adams repeatedly pleads, \"Calm down/ Just calm down,\" the emotional resonance of which verges on laughable. Meanwhile, the sleepy, acoustic blather of \"Afraid Not Scared\" has Adams repeatedly confessing that he is \"really dying in here,\" and just wants to be \"let down,\" sounding about as genuinely distraught as Ja Rule sounds genuinely \"gangsta.\"</p><p>The eight songs that constitute Love Is Hell, Pt. 1 seem intentionally built around a studio version of Adams' infamous live staple, a cover of the Oasis hit \"Wonderwall\". Acclaimed Smiths producer John Porter unfortunately buries Adams beneath a sobering wall of reverb, which drains the song of its spirited pop ingenuity and transforms its nonsensical lyrics into some sort of momentous, self-important dirge. Consequently, \"Wonderwall\" seems emblematic of the rest of the disc, a collection of preposterously cheerless (and charmless) songs that try much too hard to achieve a poignancy&mdash;or anything, really&mdash;that might hide their complete insignificance.</p><p>As Love Is Hell, Pt. 1 resoundingly proves, Adams is at his finest when he sticks to the subject matter he knows best: broken hearts and bar fights. Given this, it's no shock that the highlight of this entire project comes with the Dylanesque Beth Orton kiss-off \"English Girls Approximately\". Appearing halfway into Love Is Hell, Pt. 2, the song is classic Adams, brimming with his smug wit (sample lyric: \"You said you didn't love me, it was right on time/ I was just about to tell you, but ok, alright\") and unabashed, acoustic guitar-driven ecstasy. As Marianne Faithful lends her austere vocal harmonies to the chorus, it serves as a breathtaking reminder of the chemistry Adams shared with Emmylou Harris on Heartbreaker's divine ballad, \"Oh, My Sweet Carolina\".</p><p>Another highlight of Love Is Hell, Pt. 2 is its closing R&B; vamp, \"Chelsea Nights\". Over a bed of radiating Wurlitzer chords and bluesy guitar fills, Adams narrates a night spent aimlessly wandering New York City's unfeeling winter streets, searching for the love he always manages to lose. The track, which peaks with Adams' plaintive confession, \"I played your song/ I got the melody all wrong,\" is filled with the self-awareness, irony, and despondency that's made Adams' best work so moving, all the way back to his Whiskeytown days; it's a shame he forces his listeners to wade through a glut of unsalvageable crap-rock to arrive at it.</p><p>Indeed, these two tracks are anomalies&mdash;happy accidents, or moments of clarity&mdash;amongst the overbearing melodrama of the bulk of material contained on Love Is Hell, Pt. 2. \"Thank You Louise\" serves as the harrowing antithesis to these diamonds in the rough, an atrocious slice of sloppy sentimentality in which Adams sings, over an unnecessarily bloated string section, of a mother receiving news of her son's death. For a guy who's attained uncommon levels of infamy by simply being a sarcastic fucking prick all the time, he pours on the schmaltz here like he studied under Air Supply. The Joy Division rip-off \"City Rain, City Streets\" is so bereft of any humor that its megalomania challenges even Conor Oberst: Adams crams nearly four minutes of distorted new-wave guitars and gratuitous reverb into this shudder-inducing display of shamelessness, proudly spouting disasters like, \"I fucked you over a million times,\" and, \"You died, you died, you really died.\"</p><p>Listening to these discs, one can only imagine the myriad reasons Lost Highway decided to release the Love Is Hell sessions not as one spiraling, abysmal full-length, but as a pair of EPs (let alone why they shelved it to make way for Rock N Roll instead). The obvious, cynical answer is that it wouldn't detract from the publicity they were expecting Rock N Roll to receive. But it's also easy to envision the label's creative heads considering how spreading the material out might help conceal the songs' alarmingly empty sentiments. The sad fact is, no marketing strategy, no matter how savvy, could conceal this collection's bathetic, overwrought travesties and gruesome failures. In the midst of this mess, both Adams and Lost Highway come out losers: one critical car-wreck might have been manageable, but they may not recover from two.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Hartley Goldstein, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Last time we received a dispatch from Ryan Adams, the self-styled savior of rock & roll, it was in 2003, when he delivered his straight-up rock & roll record (aptly titled <i>Rock N Roll</i>) and his two-part mope-rock EP (later combined as one LP) <i>Love Is Hell</i>. Admirable records both, but not quite the sequel to <i>Heartbreaker</i> that fans craved. They also weren't quite as successful as all the hype surrounding their release suggested that they would be, so Adams briefly retreated from the spotlight to regroup, heading back in 2005 with a planned triptych of new albums, the first of which is the double-album <i>Cold Roses</i>, recorded with his new backing band the Cardinals and released at the beginning of May. Three albums in one year is overkill even for an artist predisposed to releasing his every whim, and while it's too early at this writing to judge whether he needed to release all three of the records, it's safe to say that <i>Cold Roses</i> is the record many fans have been waiting to hear -- a full-fledged, unapologetic return to the country-rock that made his reputation when he led Whiskeytown. Not that the album is a retreat, or a crass attempt to give the people what they want, but it's an assured, comfortable collection of 18 songs that play to Adams' strengths because they capture him not trying quite so hard.</p> <p>He settles into a warm, burnished, countryish groove not far removed from vintage Harvest-era Neil Young at the beginning and keeps it going over the course of a double-disc set that isn't all that long. With the first disc clocking in at 39:39 and the second at 36:29, this could easily have been released as a single-disc set, but splitting it into two and packaging it as a mock-gatefold LP is classic Ryan Adams, highlighting both his flair for rock classicism and his tendency to come across slightly affected. As always, he's so obsessive about fitting into classic rock's long lineage that he can be slightly embarrassing -- particularly on the intro to \"Beautiful Sorta,\" which apes David Johansen's intro to the New York Dolls' \"Looking for a Kiss\" in a way that guarantees a cringe -- which is also a problem when he drifts toward lazy, profanity-riddled lyrics (\"this sh*t just f*cks you up\" on \"Cherry Lane\") that undercut a generally strong set of writing. But what makes <i>Cold Roses</i> a success, his first genuine one since <i>Heartbreaker</i>, is that it is a genuine band album, with the Cardinals not only getting co-writing credits but helping Adams relax and let the music flow naturally. It's not the sound of somebody striving to save rock & roll, or even to be important, but that's precisely why this is the easiest Ryan Adams to enjoy. The coming months with their coming LPs will reveal whether this is indeed a shift in his point of view, or just a brief break from his trademark blustering braggadocio.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>In late 2001, Ryan Adams was inadvertently anointed the face-du-jour for \"alt-country,\" an idea scraped off the ink-smeared pages of No Depression and tremulously shot into semi-mainstream consciousness by an over-jubilant, rural-romanticizing press: Adams' \"breakthrough\" record, Gold, turned out to be a lot more alt-rock than alt-country, and its proper, non-demo follow-up, 2003's spastic Rock N Roll, ditched the pedal steel altogether, embracing, instead, overblown riffs and smarmy vocal mugging. Cold Roses, which follows two weepy acoustic EPs (2003's Love Is Hell Parts One and Two), sees Adams trudging back to his country roots, turning up the twang, curling his cowboy boots into cold, east village pavement, and transforming his frantic yawps into star-fed cries.</p><p>Even for Adams' most zealous fans, hunting down new material has never been a particularly pressing concern: The two-disc Cold Roses is one of (a vaguely audacious) three full-length releases planned for 2005 (Jacksonville City Nights is slated to arrive this summer, with 29 expected in the fall), and while Adams has never been an especially sharp judge of his own work, Cold Roses suffers considerably from its double-disc conceit. Overstuffed and vaguely monotonous, the album could be easily whittled down to a single sequence of impressive songs; Instead, it's a meandering, occasionally moving series of mid-tempo laments, some more memorable than others.</p><p>Despite ample backing by the Cardinals (guitarists J.P. Bowersock and Cindy Cashdollar, drummer Brad Pemberton, and bassist Catherine Popper; with singer-songwriter Rachael Yamagata, formerly of Chicago's Bumpus, taking guest turns on \"Cold Roses\" and \"Let It Ride\"), Cold Roses doesn't feel particularly collaborative; followers of Adams' solo work will recognize loads of parallels to Adams' post-Whiskeytown, 2000 solo debut, Heartbreaker (minus the punk throwdowns).</p><p>Cold Roses' most palpable reference point may be American Beauty-era Grateful Dead: Excellent opener \"Magnolia Mountain\" mixes slow, \"Box of Rain\" melancholy (\"If the morning don't come/ Will you lie to me?/ Will you take me to your bed and lay me down?\") with Adams' trademark guitar scrapes and sandpapered howls, while \"Cold Roses\" is packed with giddy guitar noodling and jam-friendly interludes (even Adams' vocals seem deliberately Garcia-infused, straining and paper-thin, careening off into a smoke-filled sunset.) Meanwhile, nearly every bit of electric guitar on Cold Roses sounds as though it was plucked straight from Dick's vault, all wiggly solos and playful licks, unintentional and woozy.</p><p>Lead single \"Let It Ride\" bounces, proudly shuffling through a laundry-list of country requirements: whining steel guitar, longing mentions of Tennessee and Carolina, nods to the Cumberland River and ferryboats, big, lonesome wails. But \"Let It Ride\" also employs plenty of weird, Ennio Morricone-inspired western guitar whirls, and Adams' coaxing vocals are undeniable, charmingly sincere and innocent: The resulting song is properly engaging, more classic country than alt-anything.</p><p>\"Cherry Lane\" employs honky-tonk yawping and girl-gone words (\"The glass/ It hits the floor\" is accompanied by requisite glass-shattering sound effects), while the preciously titled \"How Do You Keep Love Alive\" mopes along, wearied and oddly pretty, half-sung over a languishing piano line. Adams' songwriting proclivities have always flirted with MOR, adult-alternative sappiness, but for the most part, Cold Roses is clever and uncommonly listenable, far less bombastic and contrived than its predecessor. Even lyrically, Adams is modest and cautiously confessional, careful to avoid the cocky caterwauling that invades much of his back catalogue.</p><p>Tellingly, Cold Roses is the first Ryan Adams record not to feature a picture of him on the cover; it's increasingly difficult to say exactly when Adams transitioned from bloated media darling to scrappy underdog, but it happened, and he commandeered the passage all by himself, squirming away from the overblown antics of yesteryear and embracing, instead, the staid earnestness of his roots. It's a welcome return.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Ever since the big, splashy Gold failed to make Ryan Adams an all-conquering superstar -- it bolstered his reputation as a rock critic darling, but never had the sales to match the press -- he's retreated to genre exercises, beginning with the sleek modern rock of 2003's Rock N Roll and its moody alt-rock counterpart, Love Is Hell, carrying through to his Neil Young/Grateful Dead pastiche on his spring 2005 double album, Cold Roses, and now its autumn sequel, Jacksonville City Nights. Arriving a little over four months after Cold Roses as the second installment of a planned trilogy of 2005 releases, Jacksonville City Nights -- which at one point was going to be called the less-evocative but calendar-specific September -- is Adams' straight-up, straight-ahead country album, a lean 46-minute collection of 14 songs designed for late-night drinking. While the terrific cover art deliberately echoes classic '60s country LPs, the sound of the album isn't quite as honky tonk as that suggests, thanks to a handful of brooding numbers like \"September\" that are too introspective, lyric-centered, and light on melody to truly qualify as classicist country. These are the weakest moments here, but they're also the exception to the rule, since most of the songs here represent a number of classic country archetypes, from the opening pair of barroom anthems, \"A Kiss Before I Go\" and \"The End,\" to his \"Dear John\" duet with Norah Jones or the light hillbilly swagger of the galloping \"Trains\" and how \"My Heart Is Broken\" is sweetened by just enough swings to give it a candy coating but not enough to turn it into countrypolitan schmaltz. As good as these cuts sound, it's still hard not to shake the suspicion that Ryan Adams is primarily a pastiche artist, since it's not only easy to spot influences throughout the album, but because the atmosphere of the record makes more of an impression than the individual songs. That said, Jacksonville City Nights still ranks as one of Adams' stronger albums, not just because he's returning to his rootsy roots -- after all, this isn't alt-country, this is pure country -- but because it maintains a consistent mood, is tightly edited and well sequenced, and thanks to the Cardinals, has the easy assurance of Cold Roses, which is preferable to the somewhat desperate feel of the records immediately following Heartbreaker. It may not all add up to a major statement, which is something Gold and Rock N Roll aspired to be, but it surely makes for a more likeable and ultimately more listenable album.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Given his place in the pantheon of American rock music, Gregg Allman's solo career away from the Allman Brothers Band has been generally disappointing. Perhaps that's why it took nearly a decade between his previous album, 1997's Searching for Simplicity (its title alone indicates his frustrations) and 1988's over-produced yet underwhelming Just Before the Bullets Fly. A whopping 14 years later, Allman joins forces with roots producer to the stars T-Bone Burnett, hoping that some of the latter's mojo can rub off on a singer who is one of the great white soul and blues vocalists in rock music. For the most part it does, as the duo choose 11 relatively obscure covers from classic artists such as Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Junior Wells, and B.B. King that have clearly influenced Allman's musical approach. The backing is organic but far from stripped-down with horns, multiple guitars, and even background vocalists supporting the singer's patented crusty growl. From the opening raw thump of the ominous Sleepy John Estes' \"Floating Bridge\" to a peppy yet intense take on Muddy Waters' \"I Can't be Satisfied\" and a fiery reworking of Magic Sam's \"My Love Is Your Love,\" Allman sounds invested and inspired by this material and his musical surroundings.</p><p>Veterans such as Dr. John (credited here with his real name, Mac Rebennack), Doyle Bramhall II, and Burnett's often used rhythm section of drummer Jay Bellerose and Dennis Crouch on bass keep a taut yet easygoing lock on the groove. That's particularly evident on the predominantly acoustic version of Skip James' \"Devil Got My Woman.\" The horns that appear on five tunes never overpower the sound yet help propel Allman's soul-searing performance of Bland's \"Blind Man.\" Ditto for Otis Rush's slow blues \"Checking on My Baby,\" which brings the vocalist back to his \"Stormy Monday\"-styled beginnings. One original co-written with Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes, \"Just Another Rider,\" while not a terrible song, pales in comparison with the rest of the material and could have been saved for the next Brothers album, where it might make a better fit. Allman is credited with B-3 on the majority of the tunes, but his contributions are generally mixed so low as to be nearly inaudible. His organ can be heard on a low-down run-through of Amos Milburn's \"Tears, Tears, Tears\" that captures a sweet, jazzy noir West Coast blues. It adds up to Allman's best and surely most focused and cohesive solo release, and one where the template can hopefully be repeated in less time than it took this to appear.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Ninety-one minutes of the Allman Brothers Band in concert from a Cincinnati venue that they loved, nearly a year before their legendary Fillmore shows. The acoustics are good, though a little shaky -- the tape was made at 7 ½ ips, the bare minimum professional standard, which leaves more hiss than one might like, and a bit less clarity than a fully professional live album might show; on the other hand, the group's sound imparts its own punch and clarity, and it was done in stereo, and if not for the existence of the Fillmore tapes, and the fact that the albums they yielded sold a kajillion copies, this show might well have been released in the 1970s. It isn't as intense as the Fillmore shows, but it does capture the group as a little known working band with but a single album out and building a reputation -- and with Dickey Betts yet to emerge as either a singer or composer, and their sound still being worked out (\"Statesboro Blues\" gets a startlingly subdued performance, anticipating the acoustic version of \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" from the the '90s recording' 2nd Set). They build their set on ambitious reinterpretations of songs by Blind Willie McTell, Muddy Waters (\"Trouble In Mind\"), John Lee Hooker (\"Dimples\"), and Willie Dixon, whose \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" is a soaring highlight of this two-disc set, in a version that makes every other white band's cover seem wimpy by comparison, climaxing with a searing, though somewhat disjointed 44-minute version of \"Mountain Jam.\"</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

The great thing about that is, the original album that brought the Allmans so much acclaim is as notable for its clever studio editing as it is for its performances. Producer Tom Dowd skillfully trimmed some of the performances down to relatively concise running time (edits later restored on the double-disc set The Fillmore Concerts), at times condensing several performances into one track. Far from being a sacrilege, this tactic helps present the Allmans in their best light, since even if the music isn't necessarily concise (three tracks run over ten minutes, with two in the 20-minute range), it does showcase the group's terrific instrumental interplay, letting each member (but particularly guitarist Duane and keyboardist/vocalist Gregg) shine. Even after the release of the unedited concerts, this original double album remains the pinnacle of the Allmans and Southern rock at its most elastic, bluesy, and jazzy.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<P>When rhythm and blues met country and put on a white face in the mid 1950s, rock and roll was born and the new genre soon displaced jazz as the dominant popular music in American culture. Though it has suffered periodic lulls in the years since, especially recently, rock and roll must be considered the popular music of the second half of the twentieth century. And as such, rock and roll has been an integral part of American culture during that time. It emerged as the music of young America and has remained linked to that age group ever since. Through the years, young Americans have adopted the image of the music they listen to: the greasers of the 50s, the mop-tops of the early 60s, the hippies of the late 60s and early 70s, the punks of the late 70s, the metalheads of the 70s and 80s, and the grunge rockers of the 90s. </P><P>Yet, while Americans Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and Jerry Lee Lewis led the infancy of rock and roll, it was England that produced the first great and most influential bands of the genre: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin. Even the Jimi Hendrix Experience was two-thirds British, and the American born Hendrix needed to cross the Atlantic to get his start. </P><P>So while Americans like Bob Dylan and James Brown remain icons of rock and roll, they were basically one-man shows. No matter how talented their backing bands were, the frontman remained the focus and the star. Yet, music, especially American music, has always functioned best as a collective effort. From Dixieland to Big Band to Bluegrass to Bebop, it has always been the combination of the interplay of the group and the artistry of the soloist that has made music special. Look no further than Miles Davis' great sextet, responsible for Kind of Blue - quite possibly the finest album of any genre ever recorded. This group not only featured the incomparable Davis, but the legendary John Coltrane on tenor saxophone and the great Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderly on alto sax, backed by the world class rhythm section of pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. And still, it wasn't merely the incredible skill of any of these six individuals that make the album so magical, but rather the way that they as group work together. </P><P>When then would America produce its top-notch rock and roll band? Brian Wilson was an absolute genius, and Pet Sounds remains one of the best albums ever, but by the time the Beach Boys finally gained their freedom from Murray Wilson and their record executives, Brian Wilson was too unstable mentally for the band realize their full potential. 1966 saw the emergence of both The Doors and The Grateful Dead, both formidable bands and rock legends. But the former's career was too short and tumultuous, the latter more concerned with touring and too closely identified with their subculture to make a huge impact all at once. </P><P>In March 1969, a band came together in northern Florida that is worthy of the label as America's first great rock band. Guitarist Duane Allman joined up with his brother Gregg (vocals and Hammond B3), bassist Berry Oakley, drummers Jai Johnny Johanson (Jaimoe) and Butch Trucks and guitarist Dickey Betts to form the Allman Brothers Band. These six men came from musical roots as diverse as American culture itself: Duane was fresh off a year long stint as the lead guitarist in the Muscle Shoals house band, where he worked with some of the finest soul acts in the country, Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin amongst them. Gregg had played in rock and blues bands since his teenage years, and was a big fan of soul and r&amp;b. Jaimoe was a huge jazz fan and had toured as part of the backing bands of both Otis Redding and Percy Sledge. Trucks had been in folk bands and was a member of a symphony orchestra. Betts came from a background rich in country and bluegrass, and was proficient on both the mandolin and banjo before he even picked up a guitar. Oakley was a native of Chicago, the place to which both jazz and blues flowed from the south and then to the rest of the nation. All these various forms of American music would come together to make this American rock band. </P><P>But it was that last form of music, the blues, which was the foundation that this band was built upon. The blues was the first form of music that could be called indigenous to this country and since emerging during slave times, it has been the river that has fed all the tributaries of American music. Granted, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and even Cream were blues bands at their very core. But these were British bands offering a British interpretation of American music. The members of the Allman Brothers Band were from the land where the blues began and their rock and roll take on the blues would be one of their hallmarks as a group - and one of the more interesting things ever offered by an American band. <BR><BR>There is another element characteristic of American music to be considered. While the majority of the music of the rest of Western culture (read: European Classical) relies on form and technical perfection, American music has its roots in Africa. The blues, jazz, and gospel, all these forms of American music grew out of the African-American culture in the south, and as such reflect an African perspective on music much more than a European one. And in the African culture it isn't musical perfection that matters; it's musical expression; it's \"soul\". Conveying one's emotions is paramount.</P><P>Consequently, American music lends itself more to improvisation because no one feels the same all of the time. In order for the musician to convey his or her emotions at any given time, the song must necessarily vary. A certain amount of improvisation must enter the equation. This is why American music, from jazz on down to rock and roll has always lent itself to being a live art - best experienced in person rather than via a recording because each live performance gives birth to a new creation. </P><P>And it was these two characteristics that marked the early career of the Allman Brothers Band. The band toured incessantly, pulling close to three hundred live dates a year. On most Sundays they played free concerts in Atlanta's Piedmont Park. They played the now legendary Atlanta Pop Festival on Fourth of July Weekend in 1970. Bill Graham, probably the most famous promoter in the history of rock and roll, booked them for multiple dates at both his New York and San Francisco venues. The band was gaining a reputation as one of the premier touring bands in the country. </P><P>Every Allman Brothers' show featured their takes on a number of blues classics. Their self-titled 1969 album featured a cover of Muddy Waters' \"Trouble No More\" and 1970's Idlewild South had a cover of Willie Dixon's \"Hoochie Coochie Man\". Yet despite their touring reputation, neither album sold exceptionally well. A studio recording just couldn't capture the essence of this band. They were a live act, and the dynamic between the members as they improvised, and the interplay between band and audience was where the magic happened. </P><P>The band was aware of it: \"The stage is our natural element. We kind of get frustrated doing the records, so consequently our next album will be for the most part a live recording to get some of that natural fire on it\" , Duane said shortly before their third album was recorded. The band's manager and head of their Capricorn record label, Phil Walden agreed with the live album notion. Graham's Fillmore East in New York City was the chosen site for the weekend of March 12th and 13th, 1971. </P><P>Two shows would be played each night and renowned producer Tom Dowd, who produced Idlewild South and previously worked with John Coltrane, Aretha Franklin, Cream and numerous other legends, was brought in to oversee the recording. </P><P>The four shows yielded Live At Fillmore East, considered by many to be the finest live album of all time. At the time of its release in July 1971, Rolling Stone claimed \"Any comparison to anybody is fatuous\" and called the band \"the best damn rock 'n' roll band this country has produced in the past five years\" . The improvisational nature of the content necessitated it being released as a double LP. Walden was met with opposition by Atlantic, in charge of Capricorn's distribution. But Walden was able to change their mind: \"I informed them that we had this brilliant marketing scheme that we wanted to sell it for $6.98 because we were trying to project this image of The Allmans as sort of the people's band\". </P><P>1972's follow up, Eat a Peach, contained three additional live tracks that didn't make the cut for LAFE. In 1992, the seven tracks from LAFE were combined with those from Eat a Peach and two tracks of bonus material to create to double CD The Fillmore Concerts. It is this album that the Smithsonian should include as a defining cultural text. The Fillmore Concerts represents The Allman Brothers Band at their best, and consequently best represents an American band making American music. </P><P>Of the twelve songs on the album, six are old blues classics stamped with the Allmans' harder, eclectic seal. Following Bill Graham's famous \"OK, The Allman Brothers Band\" introduction, Blind Willie McTell's \"Statesboro Blues\" opens the album. It contains some excellent slide work from Duane Allman. The slide had long been part of the blues, as blues guitarists used it to more closely emulate the human voice with their instrument. But it was Allman who popularized it as part of rock and roll. Though a few other rock guitarists had used it before him, none did so as often nor half as well as Allman. Allen Woody, who played in the ABB in later years, once said, \"George Harrison started playing slide after that Fillmore album came out. Eric [Clapton] was playing more slide, and where did [they] get it? From Duane. Duane is probably single-handedly responsible for most of the guys in England, later that played any slide\". </P><P>But it wasn't just the Country Blues of McTell that were featured. There's the Chicago Blues with Muddy Waters' \"Trouble No More\", Sonny Boy Williamson's \"One Way Out\", and Willie Cobbs' \"You Don't Love Me\". The Delta Blues are represented by Elmore James' \"Done Somebody Wrong\". There's also the Texas Blues with T-Bone Walker's \"Stormy Monday\". The album does a good job of illustrating the various styles of America's seminal music. </P><P>But The Fillmore Concerts doesn't rely totally on the material of others; there's also plenty of original material. Dickey Betts' \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" is amongst it. At this stage in the band's development, Betts was not yet the driving force that he would become. This song represents one of his first written contributions to the band. Most likely rock and roll's premier author of instrumentals, \"Elizabeth Reed\" represents Betts' first, and probably best, foray into that area. </P><P>Yet, \"Elizabeth Reed\" isn't entirely a rock and roll song. Betts has long admitted that there is a distinct Latin flavor to it. It also features the trademark dual lead guitars of Betts and Allman. The harmonizing guitars bring to mind the work Miles Davis did with John Coltrane and later, Wayne Shorter - all three big influences on the ABB. \"We used our guitars like a brass section, playing all these harmony lines. Harmonies that sounded like they took a month to write were actually improvised\" , Betts said. </P><P>However, Betts also contends \"Western swing bands from the '30's always used that twin-harmony guitar, and a lot of the songs we did were influenced by that\" . Wherever the influence came from (probably some combination of both), this song reflects several of the various elements that make up both American music and the music of the Allman Brothers Band. The dual lead, something not really seen in rock and roll before the ABB would later be used by both Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Eagles - two other heavyweight American bands. </P><P>The importance of this song doesn't end there. It also features a solo by the dual drummers of Butch Trucks and Jaimoe - the type of solo that not many rock bands before or since have utilized. Further, the version of \"Elizabeth Reed\" that appears on The Fillmore Concerts is a combination of the late and early performances from March 13th. When the compilation album was released in 1992, producer Tom Dowd wasn't working under the time constraints he was in 1971. After listening to the master tapes of three times the song was performed in the four shows, Dowd felt this hybrid version best reflected what the band was capable of. Dowd's work in this case, and with much of the rest of 1992 album, illustrates the importance the producer has in the album making process - whether the album be a studio or a live recording. Dowd is certainly a producer in the lineage of Phil Spector, though the bands Dowd dealt with were by no means interchangeable or unimportant parts as they were with Spector. </P><P>Still, the greatness of this album goes beyond styles and production and influence. Viewed simply as a musical offering, it's absolutely jaw dropping. \"One Way Out\" shows Dickey Betts really coming into his own, ready to step out of Duane's shadow. His solo on this piece is his best work on the album. But it is the bass playing of Berry Oakley that really drives the song. Current Allman Brothers Band manager Burt Holman refers to Oakley as \"a bass player who thought he was playing guitar\" . And it's that aspect of his playing that propels this song. That characteristic has been a trademark of all of the five men to play bass for the Allman Brothers in their thirty-three year history. </P><P>At the same time, some credit must go to the drummers for allowing this to happen. Inspired by James Brown's band, Duane Allman wanted two drummers from day one, and with two drummers, the rhythm section is much beefier, freeing up the bassist to be more melodic. There aren't many other bassists who can do what Berry Oakley did on this song. </P><P>\"One Way Out\" also features another important aspect of American music: call and response. After Betts takes the first solo, the band breaks it down, and Betts and Duane Allman alternate four bar phrases, taking two apiece, as the solo baton is passed from one Les Paul to the other. Call and response had long been a part of American music, back through jazz and blues, but those 16 bars are the best example of it in American rock and roll. </P><P>Lastly, it should be noted that \"One Way Out\" is different from all the other songs on the album because it was not culled from the March 12th and 13th performances. Though the song was played those nights, when it was decided that a version of \"One Way Out\" would be included on Eat A Peach, Dowd thought the best version was from June 27, 1971 - an historic date in rock and roll history. Bill Graham had decided that the Fillmore East had run its course and decided to close it at the height of its popularity. The band he chose to be the last act ever to play the theater - none other than The Allman Brothers Band, who played from the early morning hours until sunrise in one of rock and roll's most fabled concerts. </P><P>\"Stormy Monday\" features an incredible solo from Gregg Allman. While his primary role in the band is as a growling, bluesy vocalist, this song shows that Gregg is no slouch on the Hammond B3 either. The sound of that organ is as much a part of the Allman Brothers sound as the dual lead guitars, and Allman's proficiency here makes it hard to believe that just two years prior he had never once played the instrument. While Al Kooper's B3 work may have propelled Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\"; it was Allman and The Doors' Ray Manzarek who integrated the B3 as regular part of rock and roll music. </P><P>The most incredible solo of the album however comes from Duane on \"You Don't Love Me\". The basic structure of the song wraps up at the seven minute mark, at which point, Duane simply takes off, soloing for an additional twelve minutes! Often on his own, sometimes with the band backing him, Duane gives one of the most inspirational and well respected solos in rock and roll history, rendering the audience in an awe-inspired hush. At one point someone in the audience yells out above the silence \"Play all night!\" in what has since become one of the most famous audience captures ever. Years later, jazz critic Robert Palmer would say Duane was \"the only 'rock' guitarist I had heard up to that point who could solo on a one-chord vamp for as long as half an hour or more and not only avoid boring you but keep you absolutely riveted\" . That's exactly what he does here, leaving no doubt that he was indeed one of rock and roll's all-time greatest guitarists. The legendary Jerry Wexler says of him \"I never heard a guitarist I found as satisfying as Duane\". </P><P>Duane finishes his solo by quoting a phrase from \"Joy to the World\". Though he probably wasn't mindful of it at the time, in doing so, he gave a nod to another important an element of American music: the African-American Church, which was invaluable in the contributions it made in shaping rock and roll music. </P><P>Yet, for all that individual mastery on disc one, disc two has more to offer, for it is there that the band best functions as a tight, cohesive unit - six men playing as one. \"Hot 'Lanta\", an instrumental with writing credits given to all six members of the band, opens the disc. Another song propelled by the thumping bass of Oakley, \"Hot 'Lanta\", features tight, single-minded rhythmic backing as each member is afforded a chance to solo and again showcases the trademark dual lead of Duane and Dickey. </P><P>But, what makes The Fillmore Concerts the definitive representation of March 12th and 13th, 1971 is the \"Whipping Post\" à \"Mountain Jam\" sequence. Previously, these two songs had been split between Live At Fillmore East and Eat A Peach respectively, but one listen to The Fillmore Concerts convinces anyone that these two songs were meant to be heard together. As \"Whipping Post\" ends on LAFE, one can hear Butch Trucks flashing the skills he gained during his time in the Jacksonville Symphonette, as his tympanis usher in \"Mountain Jam\". But it is only on The Fillmore Concerts can the two be heard as they were meant to be - together, just as they were during the final show on March 13, 1971. </P><P><BR>What further makes these two songs so special is that together they show the full improvisational skill of this band at the height of their powers. Improvisation has always been a part of American music, back to its jazz and Dixieland roots, and it was always a staple of the Allman Brothers Band's arsenal - that is why they are best represented by a live album. Their work on these two tracks is proof that quality group improvisation is not reserved for jazz bands. The music here ranges from the sublime to the ethereal. </P><P>How abundant is the improvisation in these two tracks? The studio version of \"Whipping Post\" clocked in at 5:16 on the band's eponymously titled debut, but is stretched to 22:37 here. Meanwhile, \"Mountain Jam\" is 33:47 long, and grew out of a previous late night jam session with members of the Grateful Dead as they collectively improvised on Donovan's two minute and thirty-four second long \"There is a Mountain\". </P><P>Like \"Hot 'Lanta\", both of these songs afford each member of the band a solo, including the drummers. Each solo is indicative of the unbelievable skill of its author - \"We have rough arrangements, layouts of the songs, and then the solos are entirely up to each member of the band\" , Duane said before the recording took place. Towards the end of \"Whipping Post\", Dickey begins playing a few lines of \"Frere Jacques\", which Duane soon picks up on and harmonizes along to, thus illustrating that good ears, not good chops, are the key to being a great player in an improvisational band. In such an environment, the most important thing a musician can do is listen to what his bandmates are doing, rather than focusing only on himself. </P><P>\"Frere Jacques\" isn't the only song to be teased in this sequence. Two-thirds of the way through \"Mountain Jam\", as the whole band joins back in following the bass solo, they tease Hendrix' \"3rd Stone from the Sun\", a song that to this day remains heavily teased by bands of the Allmans' ilk. Five minutes later, Duane teases \"Amazing Grace\", further illustrating the importance that the African-American Church has had in the development of American music. </P><P>Earlier on in \"Mountain Jam\", Duane uses his slide to make bird-like noises, reminiscent of the work he had done the previous year on Derek and The Dominoes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. </P><P>However, the improvisation heard in these songs is not the \"noodlish\" drivel that plagues many of the bands to follow in the Allmans' footsteps. In fact, it is much to the contrary. Dickey Betts' solo on \"Whipping Post\" yielded the melody that would become \"Les Brers in A minor\" - Betts' second instrumental which would appear on the band's next album, Eat A Peach. Jimmy Guterman puts it best in the liner notes to The Fillmore Concerts: In other hands, the idea of extended jams that the Allman Brothers Band perfected during their early-Seventies heyday has deteriorated into long-winded show-off exercises. But one can't blame the Allmans for that; it's not their fault that their imitators turned out to be far less inspired, that few could replicate their devotion to the blues and their determination to burn their own trail. It's worth remembering how lively and unprecedented these explorations were, especially the versions in this set, and how free-from once really stood for freedom in music, not lazy anarchy. </P><P>Still, if one were to cast aside all the group and individual excellence and were also to ignore all the representations of the roots of American rock and roll this album would still stand as Smithsonian-worthy because it epitomizes an era of American music, a bygone era - The Golden Age of Rock and Roll. From roughly 1966 to 1973, rock and roll was on top of the world, and saw an unprecedented run of creativity, ingenuity, and greatness. The Beatles moved from bubble-gum-pop to the some of the most innovative music ever created. The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin reintroduced the blues to the mainstream in a whole new light. Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix revolutionized the use of electric guitar. The Grateful Dead and The Jefferson Airplane led the summer of love. Woodstock took place. But by the mid-1970s it was gone, replaced by disco, and meaningless glam, arena, and stadium rock. </P><P>But The Fillmore Concerts is a perfect representation of this Golden Age. It truly captures what a music fan could experience at the Fillmore East, or San Francisco's Fillmore or Avalon Ballroom on any given night during this time. It is the same thing that existed at Woodstock, at Monterrey, at Atlanta and Isle of Wight. It is the same spirit that the Allman Brothers Band, The Grateful Dead, and The Band brought to Watkins Glen in the summer of 1973. The time was ripe for this kind of music. Dickey Betts said, \"We did everything we could against being commercial… It was musical telepathy. We were into individual expression. We were also lucky that the times were right for free thinkers. It was a free period\" . And The Fillmore Concerts captures this happening at its zenith. Bill Graham's associate, Alan Arkush, who saw innumerable shows at the Fillmore East calls those March shows \"one of the greatest live performances I ever witnessed\". </P><P>As the album was recorded, Hendrix and Janis Joplin had been dead for half a year, and Jim Morrison and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan were to follow soon. The very theater where the album was recorded was only to survive another three and a half months. The age was slipping by fast, but somehow, this album provides a perfect two hour and twelve minute long snapshot of it. </P><P>For example, the practice of \"sitting in\". In this era, there was a real fraternity between musicians, and is evidenced on The Fillmore Concerts. Saxophonist Rudolph \"Juicy\" Carter guests on \"Hot 'Lanta\". Longtime friend on the band Thom Doucette adds harmonica to four tracks. Even more, Elvin Bishop, who shared the bill with the Allmans that weekend, his pianist Steve Miller, and percussionist Bobby Caldwell, join the band to perform Bishop's \"Drunken Hearted Boy\" as an encore to \"Whipping Post\" à \"Mountain Jam\" to close out the album. The song's 12-bar blues structure, the same basic structure that has been the backbone of every form of original American music ever created, makes it easy for all nine musicians involved to easily tear through the number. </P><P>As the song finishes, the crowd screams for more, to which Duane playfully retorts \"That's all for tonight, thank you. Hey listen, it's six o'clock. Y'all look here. We recorded all this, this is gonna be our third album. You're all on it. We ain't gonna send you no check, but thanks\". Still the last audible sound on the track is the same audience that earlier pleaded \"Play all night!\" still screaming out \"More!\". That type of playful and inspired interaction between performer and audience just doesn't exist anymore. </P><P>Even the original album's cover represents the feeling of camaraderie that existed at that time, especially within this band. While the front of the album featured the band seated in front of the venue, the other side of the album jacket pictured the band's road crew in a similar pose. They truly were the Brotherhood that they claimed to be. How many other bands would feature their road crew on the album cover? But then, how many other bands had a crew that boasted characters such as the Legendary Red Dog, Joseph Campbell (who would be the inspiration for a character of the same name in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous) and the late Joe Dan Petty (who would go on to form the band Grinderswitch). </P><P>For The Allman Brothers Band as a unit, this album is their crowning achievement. It represents the original line-up at their peak. Just seven and a half months after it was recorded, and shortly after it was certified as their first gold record, Duane, the band's founder, leader, inspiration, and greatest talent, was tragically killed in motorcycle accident in the band's adopted hometown of Macon, GA. Eerily, Berry Oakley would suffer the same fate just a year later, only two blocks from the site of Duane's accident. </P><P>The two horrible tragedies were only the beginning, as more death, obscene amounts of drugs, constant in-fighting, and bitter contract squabbles with management would mar the band's future. But none of that can ever take away from the brilliance and importance of this band and this album. It was on the single-handed strength of this album that Capricorn established itself as a viable record label. It was because of its success that the so-called \"southern rock\" genre was able to develop and become a legitimate movement throughout the seventies. Without the Allman Brothers Band and The Fillmore Concerts there would have been no Lynyrd Skynyrd, no Marshall Tucker Band. This was also the first highly successful live album. Without it, there would be no Frampton Comes Alive, no Waiting for Columbus, no Live Rust. </P><P><BR>The Allman Brothers Band was America's first great rock band. While they were not and could not be an answer to the Beatles, they were an answer to the Rolling Stones and to Led Zeppelin. \"These players were grounded in the blues in a much more significant, intimate, and real way than British bands,\" said Atlantic Records' head and rock legend Jerry Wexler. And they were. They were an American band, playing American music from the place where it and rock and roll was born - the American South. Their then manager, Phil Walden, called them \"Southerners, living in the South, playing Southern music\" . That much is true, but it came from a man who made his living pushing the \"southern rock\" genre. As Gregg Allman once said, \"Rock and roll was born in the South; saying southern rock is like saying rock-rock\" . Pigeonholing this band as \"southern rockers\" does them a disservice; they were infinitely more than that. </P><P>And it should not go without mentioning that they were an integrated band from the American south - no small accomplishment for a band from that area. While The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Sly and the Family Stone may have been integrated before the emergence of the Allman Brothers Band, one came from a more accepting England, the other from the grossly liberal Bay Area. Neither came from the racially charged South at the height of the civil rights movement and racial tension. </P><P>The Allman Brothers Band had seemingly all the roots and influences of all the varied ingredients of American music, and The Fillmore Concerts is the best of example of them displaying those very influences, as well as their incredible musical skill. The album captures a slice of American life, and more importantly American music, that unfortunately no longer exists. When producer Tom Dowd spoke of the remastering process he used for the 1992 release he said \"Now that we've got the original 16-track tapes preserved on digital, we can send the 16-track to the Smithsonian\" . Whether Dowd meant it or not, those tapes, and this album, are certainly deserving of that honor. </P><P>— <B>Matt Bouffard</B></P>"

For years, make that decades, they have been inundated with reissues of the same material with teasers thrown in, or have been given truly bizarre compilations such as the Madacy ripoff entitled Essential, which didn't include many of the band's biggest hits and on its second disc provided a straight reissue of Enlightened Rogues. The Deluxe Edition of Eat a Peach is something different, however. For those who have been in the depths of confusion about the various Fillmore East reissues — whether the straight At Fillmore East album or the Fillmore Concerts set — this version of Eat a Peach, fully and beautifully remastered, does hold a bit of a treasure trove, though the word is that the second disc has been oft bootlegged. While the album is on disc one, in all its pieces and in proper order, disc two stands as a virtually unreleased concert of the ABB's final performance at the Fillmore on June 27, 1971 — with Duane, who was killed in October of that year. Two of the disc's tracks had been previously released — \"Midnight Rider\" (on Duane Allman Anthology, Vol. 2) and \"One Way Out\" (on the original Eat a Peach, which means the track shows up on both discs here). The rest of these performances — \"Statesboro Blues,\" \"Don't Keep Me Wonderin',\" \"Done Somebody Wrong,\" \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" (12:51 in length), \"Hot 'Lanta,\" \"Whipping Post\" (20:17 in length), and \"You Don't Love Me\" (clocking in at a whopping 17:24) — have never been officially released. Sure, it's a standard Allman Brothers set — if there ever was a such a thing. The playing is very inspired and adventurous, Gregg's singing is better than on the original Fillmore dates, and the interplay between Duane and Dickey Betts is symbiotic. And it rocks like a mother. Real fans of the original band have something to be happy about for a change, as this hidden bit of Allman memorabilia with the beloved Duane is finally on the shelves — it might have been nice if Universal had issued the second disc as its own album so you didn't have to buy Eat a Peach again, but oh well.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

Their debut album is an edgy effort, rooted in a purer Southern sound, and embracing a soulfulness that their West Coast rivals lacked. The country gospel tune \"Life's Railway to Heaven,\" the funky \"The 'Ella B',\" the stomping \"Hit the Nail on the Head,\" and the soulful \"The Beautiful Lie\" would never have been done in as raw, intense, or bracing a fashion by their rivals. Russell Smith brings a vocal performance to Charlie Rich's \"Who Will the Next Fool Be\" that sounds like he's channeling the ghost of Sam Cooke. And between those album highlights and the hits \"Third Rate Romance\" and \"Amazing Grace (Used to Be Her Favorite Song),\" the group works in a sweetly nostalgic piece called \"King of the Cowboys,\" all about movie and television heroes.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Eric Burdon & the Animals were nearing the end of their string, at least in the lineup in which they'd come into the world in late 1966, when they recorded Every One of Us in May of 1968, just after the release of their second album, The Twain Shall Meet. The group had seen some success, especially in America, with the singles \"When I Was Young,\" \"San Franciscan Nights\" and \"Sky Pilot\" over the previous 18 months, but had done considerably less well with their albums. Every One of Us lacked a hit single to help drive its sales, but it was still a good psychedelic blues album, filled with excellent musicianship by Burdon (lead vocals), Vic Briggs (guitar, bass), John Weider (guitar, celeste), Danny McCulloch (bass,12-string, vocals), and Barry Jenkins (drums, percussion), with new member Zoot Money (credited, for contractual reasons, as George Bruno) on keyboards and vocals.</p><p>Opening with the surprisingly lyrical \"White Houses\" — a piece of piercing social commentary about America in early 1968 — the record slid past the brief bridge \"Uppers and Downers\" and into the extended, John Weider-authored psychedelic mood piece \"Serenade to a Sweet Lady,\" highlighted by Briggs' superb lead acoustic guitar playing and Weider's subdued electric accompaniment. This is followed by the acoustic folk piece \"The Immigrant Lad,\" a conceptual work that closes with a dialogue, set in a workingman's bar, in which two Cockney workers, voiced by John Weider and Terry McVay, talk about their world and their lives. \"Year of the Guru\" is another in a string of Jimi Hendrix-influenced pieces by this version of the Animals, showing the entire band at the peak of their musical prowess, and Burdon — taking on virtually the role of a modern rapper — generating some real power on some surprisingly cynical lyrics concerning the search for spiritual fulfillment and leaders. \"St. James Infirmary\" recalls \"House of the Rising Sun,\" as both a song and an arrangement, and is worthwhile just for the experience of hearing this version of the group going full-tilt as a rock band. And then there is \"New York 1963 — America 1968,\" an 18-minute conceptual track with a center spoken word section featuring not a group member, but a black engineer named Cliff, who recalls his experience as a fighter pilot during World War II, and tells of poverty then and now — although the opening section starts off well enough musically, amid Burdon's sung recollections of coming to America and his fixation on the blues and black music in general, and the closing repetition of the word \"freedom\" anticipates Richie Havens' famed piece (actually an extension of \"Motherless Child\") from Woodstock, the track is too long and unwieldy for any but the most fanatical listener to absorb as more than a curiosity of its time.</p><p>In fairness, it must also be said that Burdon's mixing of politics and music, social criticism and art, however inappropriate as pop music for a mass audience, was out in front of most of the competition during this period, in terms of boldness and reach, if not grasp. The extended jamming on this and the other songs also highlighted a fundamental problem that afflicted this version of the Animals from the get-go, the fact that they were touring too much to write enough songs to properly fill their albums, which meant extending the instrumental portions of everything that was on them, in order to fill up the running time; this group had the musicianship and talent to pull it off totally successfully in all but one instance here. This album would be one of the last times that this lineup of the group would appear on record — Briggs and McCulloch would leave later in the year, both to be replaced by Andy Somers (aka Andy Summers), and the group as a whole would pack it in with the waning of 1968.</p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong>"

The rest of the music, instantly recognizable to anyone who saw even one episode of the series, borders on fever-dream jazz. Lynch favorite Julee Cruise sings the only three vocal songs.

Only five months before, the group released the joyous A Hard Day's Night. Now, they sound beaten, worn, and, in Lennon's case, bitter and self-loathing. His opening trilogy (\"No Reply,\" \"I'm a Loser,\" \"Baby's in Black\") is the darkest sequence on any Beatles record, setting the tone for the album. Moments of joy pop up now and again, mainly in the forms of covers and the dynamic \"Eight Days a Week,\" but the very presence of six covers after the triumphant all-original A Hard Day's Night feels like an admission of defeat or at least a regression. (It doesn't help that Lennon's cover of his beloved obscurity \"Mr. Moonlight\" winds up as arguably the worst thing the group ever recorded.) Beneath those surface suspicions, however, there are some important changes on Beatles for Sale, most notably Lennon's discovery of Bob Dylan and folk-rock. The opening three songs, along with \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,\" are implicitly confessional and all quite bleak, which is a new development. This spirit winds up overshadowing McCartney's cheery \"I'll Follow the Sun\" or the thundering covers of \"Rock & Roll Music,\" \"Honey Don't,\" and \"Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!,\" and the weariness creeps up in unexpected places -- \"Every Little Thing,\" \"What You're Doing,\" even George's cover of Carl Perkins' \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\" -- leaving the impression that Beatlemania may have been fun but now the group is exhausted. That exhaustion results in the group's most uneven album, but its best moments find them moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p> <hr/><p>The Beatles faced the same pressures  every teen sensation has since-- fatigue, frustration, being bounced  into recording substandard material. \"It isn't a pot-boiling quick-sale  any-old-thing-will-do-for-Christmas mixture,\" claimed Derek Taylor  on the Beatles For Sale sleeve. This pre-emptive strike looks more than  a little defensive, especially when the cover versions are back in force,  and one of them is the notorious and oft-detested \"Mr. Moonlight\".The workrate expected of early-1960s pop  stars is one of the hardest things for modern listeners to get their  heads around. We're used to bands making a record, touring in support, searching for inspiration, trying out new ideas, maybe two years  later making another. Because our experience of the early Beatles is  structured around their albums, we tend to think of them as doing something  similar, except at a much more rapid pace. As Ian Macdonald's superb  Revolution in the Head makes clear, this wasn't true: albums,  singles, EPs, tours tumbled over one another with hardly a break--  a firehose of almost continuous activity.There were two reasons for this workload.  Firstly the music industry simply hadn't worked out yet how to extend  a record's shelf life-- singles weren't taken from albums after all. Secondly the lifespan of acts wasn't expected  to be long, so it made sense to get the most work possible out of them.</p><p>The famous hotch-potch of their early American catalogue was one result.  The Beatles themselves were changing how the business worked, but Beatles  For Sale, of all the British records, bears the stamp of these business  realities. It's a mess.But it's a really good mess. Taylor's  sleevenotes are also interesting because they go out of the way to reassure  listeners that everything they're hearing can be reproduced live.  Studio experimentation was becoming more important to the band and producer George  Martin, but clearly someone viewed it with a little nervousness. You  can understand why: The Lennon-McCartney originals on Beatles For Sale are often full of curious arrangements, drones, jagged transitions, and  lashings of aggression. Blame pot, or the inspiration of Bob Dylan, or just the pressure-cooker  environment the group was in, but the record hits a seam of angry creativity.This is particularly true of Lennon's  amazing first three songs. \"No Reply\" shatters itself with waves  of jealous rage, taking the menace that had flecked Beatles music and  bringing it up in the mix: his dangerously quiet \"that's a lie\"  is the most chilling moment in their catalogue. \"I'm a Loser\"  turns that anger inward with just as much brutality. And \"Baby's in Black\" curdles a nursery rhyme, transforms the group's crisp pop sound  into an off-kilter clang, and uses John and Paul McCartney's double vocal to  thicken the soupy sound even further. </p><p>This run of tracks marries the  direct attack of their earliest material and the boundary-pushing of  their later albums, and stands with the best of both.Even so it's a relief when \"Rock  and Roll Music\" breaks the tension, especially when you notice that  the band are playing their best rock'n'roll since \"Twist and Shout\".  Perhaps the workrate had pushed them back into the Hamburg hot zone,  but the uptempo covers on Beatles For Sale are fiercely good-- as ragged,  loud and immediate as the songs needed to be. Even \"Mr. Moonlight\"  fits the aggressive mood, the ugliness of its organ solo surely deliberate.McCartney's songs on Beatles For Sale are more thoughtful than moody, though on his splendid \"Every Little  Thing\"-- given melodramatic thrust by Shangri-Las-style piano  and bass drum-- he's distinctly melancholy, his \"yes, I know I'm  a lucky guy\" sounding like an attempt to convince himself of that. But Lennon's  anger and the band's rediscovery of rock'n'roll mean For Sale's  reputation as the group's meanest album is deserved, even if it has  \"Eight Days a Week\" as its breezy centerpiece. The lumpiest and  least welcoming of their early records, it's also one of the most  rewarding.[Note: Click here for an overview of the 2009 Beatles reissues, including discussion of the packaging and sound quality.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Tom Ewing, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This covers the late '50s to the end of 1964, mixing studio outtakes, live performances, primitive recordings from the Quarrymen/Silver Beatles days, excerpts from the famous 1962 Decca audition, the most notable 1961 Tony Sheridan-era recordings, and brief spoken bits from interviews. Although this material is undeniably of vast historical importance, it can't be placed in the same company as the Beatles' proper albums, in either cohesion or quality. While the studio outtakes (many never even heard on bootleg) are the most enticing items, these are almost exclusively alternate versions of songs they placed on their official releases (the most notable exceptions being the 1964 R&B cover \"Leave My Kitten Alone,\" the 1962 demo \"How Do You Do It,\" and the unimpressive 1964 Harrison original \"You Know What to Do\"). Sometimes the differences are quite interesting (a much more electric-oriented version of \"And I Love Her,\" for example), but the alternates also illustrate how the group were virtually unerring in selecting the best arrangement and take of their songs for the final versions. The pre-1962 items are sometimes taken from private rehearsal tapes of primitive fidelity and are really of archival value only. One could go on at great length about the many curiosities and finds unearthed by this compilation, but for most general consumers, two observations may suffice. It does not stand up to the Beatles' fully conceived albums (even Live at the BBC), but the Beatles' scraps and leavings are more interesting than over 95 percent of other performers' best work. By that standard, this must be judged a worthwhile collection, especially (but not solely) for dedicated Beatles fans.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>All the rules fell by the wayside with Revolver, as the Beatles began exploring new sonic territory, lyrical subjects, and styles of composition. It wasn't just Lennon and McCartney, either -- Harrison staked out his own dark territory with the tightly wound, cynical rocker \"Taxman\"; the jaunty yet dissonant \"I Want to Tell You\"; and \"Love You To,\" George's first and best foray into Indian music. Such explorations were bold, yet they were eclipsed by Lennon's trippy kaleidoscopes of sound. His most straightforward number was \"Doctor Robert,\" an ode to his dealer, and things just got stranger from there as he buried \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" in a maze of multi-tracked guitars, gave Ringo a charmingly hallucinogenic slice of childhood whimsy in \"Yellow Submarine,\" and then capped it off with a triptych of bad trips: the spiraling \"She Said She Said\"; the crawling, druggy \"I'm Only Sleeping\"; and \"Tomorrow Never Knows,\" a pure nightmare where John sang portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead into a suspended microphone over Ringo's thundering, menacing drumbeats and layers of overdubbed, phased guitars and tape loops. McCartney's experiments were formal, as he tried on every pop style from chamber pop to soul, and when placed alongside Lennon's and Harrison's outright experimentations, McCartney's songcraft becomes all the more impressive. The biggest miracle of Revolver may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly. Either way, its daring sonic adventures and consistently stunning songcraft set the standard for what pop/rock could achieve. Even after Sgt. Pepper, Revolver stands as the ultimate modern pop album and it's still as emulated as it was upon its original release.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Like any band, the Beatles' recording career was often altered, even pushed forward, as much by external factors as their own creative impulses. The group's competitive drive had them, at times, working to match or best Bob Dylan or Brian Wilson; their drug use greatly colored the musical outlook of John Lennon and George Harrison in particular; and the death of former manager Brian Epstein ushered in a period of distracting and poor business choices and opened the door for individuals such as the celebrity guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Yoko Ono, and businessman Allen Klein to penetrate, alter, and, some would say, disintegrate their inner circle.</p><p>The most important of these external shifts in the Beatles narrative, however, was a series of changes that allowed them to morph into a studio band. The chain of events that ushered in the band's changing approach to studio music began before Rubber Soul, but the results didn't come into full fruition until Revolver, a 35-minute LP that took 300 hours of studio time to create-- roughly three times the amount allotted to Rubber Soul, and an astronomical amount for a record in 1966.</p><p>Longtime Beatles producer George Martin, justifiably upset that EMI refused to give him a raise on the back of his extraordinarily profitable work with the Beatles, quit his post with the label in August 1965. Martin used his clout to create his own company, and the group and producer used theirs to effectively camp out at Abbey Road Studios for whatever length of time suited them rather than being forced to comply to the rigid and economically sound schedules demanded by labels at the time. The Beatles could now work both in and out of the studio, taking full advantage of new advancements in sound recording that allowed them to reflect upon and tinker with their work, explore new instruments and studio trickery, and refine their music by solving problems when they arose.This new approach not only greatly altered their work environment, but drove the Beatles to value the flexibility of emerging technology. They also cashed in some of their commercial capital to abandon the mentally and physically sapping practice of touring-- and the glad-handing and public relations requirements that went with it. Exceptionalism became the watchword for the band, and it responded by using its freedom to push forward its art and, by extension, the whole of pop music. Musically, then, the Beatles began to craft dense, experimental works; lyrically, they matched that ambition, maturing pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived.</p><p>Revolver was also the first record in which the impression of the Beatles as a holistic gang was disrupted. The group had taken three months off prior to Revolver-- easily its longest break since the start of its recording career-- and each band member went his own separate way after years of moving around the world as a unit. Even without the break, it's possible that the group would continue to explore individual concerns: After starting to do just that on Rubber Soul, it was only natural that the Beatles wished to continue to highlight their individual strengths on its follow-up, and they did by listing each song's lead singer on the record sleeve.The first, surprisingly, was George Harrison, who kicks off the record with another stab at politics on \"Taxman\", and then later offers philosophical musings on \"I Want to Tell You\" and the Indian-flavored \"Love You To\". Over the next year or two, Harrison's guitar played a more background role in the group's recordings-- fortuitously, then, that time also corresponded with the years in which the Beatles were pleased to bunker down in the studio and most explore the dynamic tension between their individual interests and their final stretch of camaraderie and mutual respect.</p><p>Lennon's primary interest throughout much of this time was himself, something that continued throughout his career-- he was always suspicious, even dismissive, of Paul McCartney's character songs, but once he and Yoko Ono joined forces, her Fluxus-rooted belief in art-as-subjectivity became orthodoxy in his mind. Lennon's early explorations of self and mind that began on Rubber Soul continued on Revolver, as the suburbanite spent much of his time at home indulging his zest for the exploratory powers of LSD. He contributes five songs to Revolver, and, indeed, each is concerned with drugs, the creative mind, a suspicion of the outside world, or all three.</p><p>Each is also uniformly wonderful, and together they provide a tapestry of Lennon's burgeoning art-pop, which, along with Martin's inventive arrangements and playful effects, would peak the next year with the triumphs of \"I Am the Walrus\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", and \"A Day in the Life\". The gauzy \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and rollicking 1-2 of \"She Said She Said\" and \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" aren't nearly as demonstrative as the songs he'd write in their wake-- as a result each remains oddly underrated-- but they function as some of Lennon's most purely satisfying pop songs.\" Tomorrow Never Knows\" is another thing entirely. While \"Doctor Robert\" or \"She Said She Said\" touched on drug culture playfully or privately, \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" was a full-on attempt to recreate the immersive experience of LSD-- complete with lyrics borrowed from Timothy Leary's Tibetan Book of the Dead-inspired writings. Remarkably, though, much of it due to Martin's experimental production, tape loops, and musique concrète-inspired backdrop, the song is lively and giddy instead of self-serious or preachy. Even Martin's primitive psychedelia could have been thudding and ponderous, and yet more than four decades later the entire thing seems less a clear product of its time than not only most art or experimental rock, but most Beatles records as well.</p><p>Despite that triumph, however, Revolver was McCartney's maturation record as much as Rubber Soul was for Lennon. While Harrison was learning at the feet of sitar master Ravi Shankar and Lennon was navigating heavy use of psychotropic drugs, McCartney was refining his compositional chops by exploring classical music, training an eye for detail and subtlety in his lyrics, and embracing the orchestral work of Brian Wilson.McCartney's optimism and populism resulted in the most demonstrative songs he created for Revolver-- the brassy \"Good Day Sunshine\" (which delightfully toes the line between schmaltz and heartwarming) and \"Got to Get You Into My Life\", and the children's music staple \"Yellow Submarine\", an inventive and charming track too often derided as camp. (It's also an early indication that it would be McCartney who would hold tightest to the impression of the group as a unit-- the image of the band all living together here was, for the first time in years, untrue).</p><p>The understated qualities of McCartney's lyrics began to be misconstrued as simplistic in his ballads, but he provides three of his best here: \"For No One\", all the more affecting because it's slight and difficult to grasp, \"Here, There and Everywhere\", a model of sepia-toned sentimentality, and \"Eleanor Rigby\", which in its own way was as groundbreaking and revolutionary as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". Virtually a short story set to music, \"Rigby\" and its interwoven descriptions of lonely people was and is a desolate and altogether mature setting for a pop song.Revolver in the end is the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence. The Beatles had been transformed into a group not beholden to the expectations of their label or bosses, but fully calling the shots-- recording at their own pace, releasing records at a less-demanding clip, abandoning the showmanship of live performance. Lesser talents or a less-motivated group of people may have shrunk from the challenge, but here the Beatles took upon the task of redefining what was expected from popular music. Lest we forget it, the original flashpoint of Beatlemania remains the most influential and revolutionary period in the Beatles career, but the creative high points of 1966-67 aren't far behind. It's worth remembering as well that what had been demanded or expected from them as entertainers and popular musicians was something they'd challenged from their first cheeky, flippant interview, but just a few years later they were no longer mere anomalies within the world of pop, no longer potential fads; they were avatars for a transformative cultural movement.</p><p>[Note: Click here for an overview of the 2009 Beatles reissues, including discussion of the packaging and sound quality.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Scott Plagenhoef, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>With Revolver, the Beatles made the Great Leap Forward<p>, reaching a previously unheard-of level of sophistication and fearless experimentation. Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian \"When I'm 64\" seems like a logical extension of \"Within You Without You\" and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of \"Lovely Rita.\" There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer, George Martin, but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison, Lennon's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. \"With a Little Help From My Friends\" is the ideal Ringo tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine Lennon anguish, à la \"Help!\"; \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of \"A Day in the Life,\" a haunting number that skillfully blends Lennon's verse and chorus with McCartney's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better Beatles albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Finally free of touring, the Beatles next sought to be free of themselves, hitting on the rather daft concept of recording as an alias band. The idea held for all of two songs, one coda, and one album sleeve, but was retained as the central organizing and marketing feature of the band's 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Hailed on its release as proof that popular music could be as rich an artistic pursuit as more high-minded media such as jazz and classical, the record's reputation and sense of ambition ushered in the album era. Its influence was so pervasive and so instructional regarding the way music is crafted and sold to the public that this is still the predominant means of organizing, distributing, and promoting new music four decades later, well after the decline of physical media.The concept, of course, is that the record was to be recorded by the titular fictional band, a washed-up rock'n'roll group on the comeback trail. (This was actually the second concept earmarked for the Beatles' next LP; the original, a record of songs about Liverpool, was abandoned when its first two tracks were needed for the group's next single, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/ \"Penny Lane\".) Probably for the best, little of the fictional-band vision for the record made it through; what did last from that conceit are a few tangential ideas-- a satirical bent on popular entertainment and a curiosity with nostalgia and the past.</p><p>The record opens with a phony live performance by the Lonely Hearts Band, a sort of Vegas act&mdash;the sort of thing that, in 1963, people thought the almost certainly soon-to-be-passé Beatles would be doing themselves in 1967. Instead, the Beatles had completed their shattering of the rules of light entertainment, even halting their own live performances, which they'd never again do together for a paid audience.Even as they mocked this old version of a performing band, ironically Sgt. Pepper's and its ambitions helped to codify the rock band as artists rather than popular entertainers. In the hands of their followers, the notion of a pop group as a compact, independent entity, responsible for writing, arranging, and performing its own material would be manifested in the opposite way&mdash;rather than holing up in the studio and focusing on records, bands were meant to prove in the flesh they could \"bring it\" live. Notions of authenticity and transparency would become valued over studio output. (To be fair, upstart bands had to gig in order to get attention and a reputation, while the Beatles, of course, could write, break, and rewrite their own rules; they had the luxury and freedom to take advantage of a changing entertainment world and could experiment with different, emerging models of how to function as a rock band in much the same way that Trent Reznor or Radiohead can today.)</p><p>The freedom from live performance didn't necessitate that Beatles songs now sounded practiced or rehearsed, and indeed they weren't. Instead, they were studio creations assembled in sections and pieces. As the band splintered, this practice would spill over into releasing song sketches on the White Album and inspire, in part through necessity, the lengthy song cycle at the close of Abbey Road. On Sgt. Pepper's, the most rewarding manifestation of this shift was the record's most forward-looking piece, \"A Day in the Life\". Complex in construction and epic in feel, \"A Day in the Life\" nevertheless seems enveloping and breezy to listeners. Indeed, the sustained, closing ringing chord of the song comes a mere 4:20 into the track.\"A Day\"'s only best-in-show competitor was McCartney's \"She's Leaving Home\". (As on Revolver, the peaks here were a mold-breaking closer and classically inspired story-song). \"A Day in the Life\" has only grown in estimation, rightfully becoming one of the most acclaimed Beatles tracks. \"She's Leaving Home\", by contrast, has slid from view&mdash;perhaps too maudlin to work on classic rock radio and too MOR for hipster embrace, it was nevertheless the other headline track on Sgt. Pepper's when it was released. The story of a runaway teen, it misses as a defiant generational statement in part because it's actually sympathetic to the parents in the song. In the second verse, McCartney defies expectations by not following the young girl on her adventure but keeping the track set in the home as her parents wake to find her goodbye letter.In the end, we learn \"She\" left home for \"fun\"&mdash;a rather churlish reason, and when paired with McCartney's simplistic sentiments in \"When I'm 64\" (the aging couple there will be happy to \"scrimp and save\"), the young girl seems more selfish than trapped. In fact, for a group whose every move was a generational wedge, and for such a modern record, the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's is oddly conservative in places: \"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite\" takes inspiration from a Victorian-era carnival; \"When I'm 64\" is a music-hall parody that fantasizes about what it would be like to be the Beatles' grandparents' age; \"Fixing a Hole\" has a rather mundane domestic setting; the fantasy girl in \"Lovely Rita\" is a cop.Lyrically, it's an atypical way to usher in the Summer of Love, but musically, the record is wildly inventive, built on double-tracking, tape effects, and studio technology. The dream-like haze of \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\", the fairground, sawdust feel of \"Mr. Kite\", and the cavalcade of sound effects at the end of \"Good Morning Good Morning\" were the most demonstrative sounds on the record, but otherwise benign passages were also steeped in innovation, whether recording from the inside of a brass instrument or plugging instruments directly into the sound board instead of capturing them through mics.Almost everything done on Sgt. Pepper's turned out to be new and forward-thinking, from the iconic record sleeve to the totemic ending to \"A Day in the Life\".</p><p>There are very few moments in pop music history in which you can mark a clear before and after, in which almost everything changed. In the UK, it's arguably happened only five times, and on just four instances in the U.S. (Thriller here; acid house and punk there, and Elvis everywhere, of course); in both nations, the Beatles launched two of those moments.In retrospect, it almost seems like this time the band itself was taken aback by its own accomplishments, not only shying from directly living up to Revolver via the smoke and mirrors of the Lonely Hearts Club Band but then never again throwing themselves into their work as a collective unit. Sgt. Pepper's, possibly as a corrective to the hushed tones with which it's been received for decades, has slipped in estimation behind a few of the band's other records, but it's easy to hear how it achieved that reputation in the first place. Even if John, Paul, George, and Ringo would arguably go on to best a handful of its moments, the amazing stretch of music created in 1966-67 was the peak of the Beatles as a working band.[Note: Click here for an overview of the 2009 Beatles reissues, including discussion of the packaging and sound quality.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Scott Plagenhoef, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the so-called White Album interesting is its mess. Never before had a rock record been so self-reflective, or so ironic; the Beach Boys send-up \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" and the British blooze parody \"Yer Blues\" are delivered straight-faced, so it's never clear if these are affectionate tributes or wicked satires. Lennon turns in two of his best ballads with \"Dear Prudence\" and \"Julia\"; scours the Abbey Road vaults for the musique concrète collage \"Revolution 9\"; pours on the schmaltz for Ringo's closing number, \"Good Night\"; celebrates the Beatles cult with \"Glass Onion\"; and, with \"Cry Baby Cry,\" rivals Syd Barrett. McCartney doesn't reach quite as far, yet his songs are stunning -- the music hall romp \"Honey Pie,\" the mock country of \"Rocky Raccoon,\" the ska-inflected \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\" and the proto-metal roar of \"Helter Skelter.\" Clearly, the Beatles' two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither were George and Ringo. Harrison still had just two songs per LP, but it's clear from \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the canned soul of \"Savoy Truffle,\" the haunting \"Long, Long, Long,\" and even the silly \"Piggies\" that he had developed into a songwriter who deserved wider exposure. And Ringo turns in a delight with his first original, the lumbering country-carnival stomp \"Don't Pass Me By.\" None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

(The rest of the album was filled out with \"Yellow Submarine,\" \"All You Need Is Love,\" and a George Martin score.) What's more, two of the four new tracks were little more than pleasant throwaways that had been recorded during 1967 and early 1968. These aren't all that bad; \"All Together Now\" is a cute, kiddie-ish McCartney singalong, while \"Hey Bulldog\" has some mild Lennon nastiness and a great beat and central piano riff, with some fine playing all around -- each is memorable in its way, and the inclusion of the Lennon song here was all the more important, as the sequence from the movie in which it was used was deleted from the original U.S. release of the movie (which had no success whatever in the U.K. and quickly disappeared, thus making the U.S. version the established cut of the film for decades. George Harrison's two contributions were the more striking of the new entries -- \"Only a Northern Song\" was a leftover from the Sgt. Pepper's sessions, generated from a period in which the guitarist became increasingly fascinated with keyboards, especially the organ and the Mellotron (and, later, the synthesizer). It's an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments. Its lyrics (and title) on the one hand express the guitarist/singer/composer's displeasure at being tied in his publishing to Northern Songs, a company in which John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the majority shareholders; and, on the other, they present Harrison's vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside-out and the outside-in, during the psychedelic era -- the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967. And then there was the jewel of the new songs, \"It's All Too Much.\" Coming from the second half of 1967, the song -- resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar -- was a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia, and was actually superior in some respects to \"Blue Jay Way,\" Harrison's songwriting contribution to The Magical Mystery Tour; the song also later rated a dazzling cover by Steve Hillage in the middle of the following decade. The very fact that George Harrison was afforded two song slots and a relatively uncompetitive canvas for his music shows how little the project meant to Lennon and McCartney -- as did the cutting of the \"Hey Bulldog\" sequence from the movie, apparently with no resistance from Lennon, who had other, more important artistic fish to fry in 1968. What is here, however, is a good enough reason for owning the record, though nothing rates it as anything near a high-priority purchase. The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP (an idea the Beatles even considered at one point, with the addition of a bonus track in \"Across the Universe\" but ultimately discarded).</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p><hr/><p>Hey, nobody's perfect. The only truly minor album in the Beatles' catalogue isn't really an album at all. Yellow Submarine, released in January 1969, is the soundtrack to the feature-length cartoon of the same name, a project with which the Beatles had little involvement. The idea of an animated film stretched back to 1965, but these were busy years for the band, and the project was pushed to the backburner. Once the movie finally got underway in 1967, the Beatles had no real interest in the details.In one sense, the Yellow Submarine project is the opposite of Magical Mystery Tour. While the latter film was derided as pretentious and incoherent, the Yellow Submarine feature was well-received. And while the record releases associated with Magical Mystery Tour are of staggeringly high quality, the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered.</p><p>Brian Epstein had died in August, and with him gone, there was little motivation for the Beatles to participate in any meaningful way. So actors mimicked their voices, their input into the story consisted of a meeting or two with the filmmakers, and when it came time to assemble the soundtrack, they combed through the vault to see what was left over.Of the six tracks by the Beatles on the album's first side, two, \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"All You Need Is Love\", are already familiar from their original contexts (as part of Revolver and as a single, respectively). The other four were holdovers from sessions in 1967 (Paul McCartney's \"All Together Now\", George Harrison's \"It's All Too Much\" and \"It's Only a Northern Song\") and 1968 (John Lennon's \"Hey Bulldog\"). They never found release during the time they were recorded because, well, they weren't good enough. Granted, we're talking about a time when the Beatles were making some of the finest pop albums of all time, so the question of what constitutes \"good enough\" is relative. But even setting aside their exceedingly high standards, this lot is pretty middling, if certainly still enjoyable.Neither of Harrison's songs ranks with his best. \"Only a Northern Song\" and \"It's All Too Much\" are filled with swirling psychedelic production-- tooting horns, backward instruments, shimmering percussion-- but beneath the din there's not much else interesting going on. \"Only a Northern Song\" at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company (i.e., no matter what Harrison wrote for this particular number, it belonged to Northern Songs, Ltd.). But \"It's All Too Much\" stretches on for an endless six and a half minutes, the constipated production in fruitless search of a tune.</p><p>For McCartney's part, \"All Together Now\" is a cheery and pleasant sing-along befitting an animated soundtrack, and Lennon's \"Hey Bulldog\" is a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, by a good margin the best song here. They might be second-rate Beatles songs, but still.To round out the album, the second side of Yellow Submarine is filled with George Martin's score for the film. Pieces like \"Pepperland\", \"Sea of Holes\", and \"March of the Meanies\", however they were received at the time, function now primarily as garish kitsch, lushly orchestrated orchestral music that could have come from anywhere. Personally, I can enjoy this stuff when I'm in the mood. The blandly anonymous but beautifully recorded swoop of strings, self-consciously \"exotic\" percussion, and recurring thematic motifs serve as an intriguing sort of time capsule of a time when light \"beautiful music\" still commanded the ears of a sizeable listening pubic. But it's very easy to forget that the music has anything to do with the Beatles, or even popular music of the last 50 years, at least until the \"Yellow Submarine\" melody returns in \"Yellow Submarine in Pepperland\". As a souvenir of the film, Yellow Submarine has its place, and in fairness, it was never intended as a major release. But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise.[Note: Click here for an overview of the 2009 Beatles reissues, including discussion of the packaging and sound quality.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

But the emphasis is upon alternate takes from early 1965 to early 1968, during which time the group rapidly evolved from post-Merseybeat through folk-rock to psychedelia. As with the first volume, this is nearly always interesting but perhaps thinner on revelations than some might expect. The Help!-era outtakes \"If You've Got Troubles\" and \"That Means a Lot\" are on the light side but very fun, especially the latter, which Paul and the group perform much better than P.J. Proby (who covered the song shortly afterward). Some of the alternate takes are extremely different and excellent performances on their own merits: the funkier version of \"I'm Looking Through You\" and the less mellow arrangement of \"Norwegian Wood,\" a wall-of-drugs reverb for \"Tomorrow Never Knows,\" a very Byrds-like approach to \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" (with giggle-laden vocals), and an acoustic demo of \"Fool on the Hill.\" The earlier, much more acoustic version of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is the most notable gem. On the other hand, much of the material differs from the official cuts in fairly minute gradations and will be of greater interest to scholars than general listeners (although discoveries like a different solo on \"Penny Lane\" are fascinating). The seven live tracks on disc one, from the waning days of Beatlemania, are better than many would have assumed, showing the group still capable of generating heat on-stage.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

In terms of sheer listenability, this may be the strongest volume of the three, if only because it focuses almost solely upon studio recordings rather than mixing live concerts/broadcasts and outtakes. Also, by this time the Beatles had perfected their approach to recording, meaning that even the early/alternate versions of many of their cuts were often of outstanding quality. There's some prime stuff here: \"unplugged\" White Album demos from mid-1968, radically different versions of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Helter Skelter,\" a stringless \"The Long and Winding Road,\" three beautifully sung and played Harrison solo demos from early 1969, and several songs the Beatles never released, like \"All Things Must Pass,\" \"Not Guilty,\" \"Teddy Boy,\" \"Come and Get It,\" and \"Junk.\" Not everything here is so great that the casual consumer will be fascinated, of course. As on previous Anthology sets, some of these alternates are only very slightly different from the official versions; the oldies covers from the Let It Be era are off-the-cuff jams that aren't up to the group's usual level of brilliance. It's still a fascinating collection, both for the insight it affords you into the group's creative process at the end of their career, and for the considerable excellence of the music itself.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Picking up in 1965 where Past Masters, Vol. 1 left off, Past Masters, Vol. 2 collects the 15 non-LP tracks that the Beatles released in the last five years of their career (not counting the singles that were released on Magical Mystery Tour). If Vol. 2 is more eclectic than its predecessor, it isn't quite as thematically consistent, but it does hit greater highs with a greater frequency. Indeed, some of the greatest singles in pop history are here: \"Day Tripper,\" \"We Can Work It Out,\" \"Paperback Writer,\" \"Rain,\" \"Lady Madonna,\" \"Hey Jude,\" \"Revolution,\" \"Don't Let Me Down,\" and \"The Ballad of John and Yoko.\" All of the aforementioned are staples in the Lennon/McCartney canon, and while George Harrison's two contributions aren't as familiar, \"The Inner Light\" is arguably his best Indian excursion and \"Old Brown Shoe\" is a charmingly jaunty tune that points toward his solo career. In the middle of all this, single versions of \"Get Back\" and \"Let It Be\" appear (the former is stiffer than the LP version, the latter is better than its counterpart), along with the alternate (and superior) \"Across the Universe\" and the silly yet strangely irresistible \"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number).\" Overall, the compilation feels a little disjointed, mainly because it covers so much ground so quickly, but that takes nothing away from the quality of the music, since many of these songs rank among the best, most inventive recordings of the pop/rock era.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Past Masters is the  ugly but brilliant sibling of the Beatles discography. Originally released  as two separate discs in 1988, it's a catchall for  all the stuff the Beatles officially released during their existence  that wasn't intended for their albums (and didn't end up on the after-the-fact  album Magical Mystery Tour). It's slapped together chronologically,  so it begins with an unprepossessing alternate take of \"Love Me  Do\" and ends with the ludicrous doodle \"You Know My Name (Look  Up the Number)\". And, between them, it includes some of the best  pop songs ever recorded-- scratch that: some of the best pop singles ever recorded.It can be hard to grasp the  way it used to work if you've grown up with the basic unit of pop music  as the album or the individual song, but the model the Beatles grew  up with-- and arguably broke-- was the 45 RPM single: two songs sold together,  one of them aspiring to popular success and the other one a sort of  lagniappe. They treated their own singles not just as hit-plus-filler  but as an often-complementary pair: the massive humanist crescendo of \"Hey Jude\"  paired with the corrective political fireball of \"Revolution\",  the frantic urgency of \"Paperback Writer\" paired with the  dreamy involution of \"Rain\", John Lennon's bitter, betrayed \"Day  Tripper\" paired with Paul McCartney's hopeful, clear-eyed \"We Can Work  It Out\".For that matter, their singles  weren't simply teasers for an album: Of the 22 singles (and two EPs) the  Beatles released in the UK between 1962 and 1970, more than half weren't  initially part of a bigger unit.</p><p>Their first non-album single, \"From  Me to You\", came out all of three weeks after Please Please  Me; \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" emerged a week after  With the Beatles. \"Day Tripper\"/\"We Can Work It Out\"  was actually released-- as a double A-side-- the same day as Rubber  Soul, on which neither side appeared. By that point, they were basically  just showing off.Most of the first disc of  Past Masters is the product the Beatles were being pushed to crank  out over the first three years of their recording career: The three-covers-and-a-leftover  Long Tall Sally EP, German recordings of a couple of hits, a version  of Larry Williams' \"Bad Boy\" that filled out an American LP.  It also features the two phenomenal, headlong late 1963 singles that  transformed them from a perfectly nice Liverpool band to The Goddamn  Beatles: \"She Loves You\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\".  It's a testament to the Beatles' gamechanging originality that the  opportunistic American bands who tried to make a few bucks by covering  those songs over the following few months couldn't even play them right-- the  harmonies of \"She Loves You\" and the delicious rhythmic trick  that introduces \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" flummoxed every  one of them.</p><p>The astonishing stuff continues  on the second disc: seven A-side/B-side pairs, plus an alternate version  of John's devotional \"Across the Universe\". \"Paperback  Writer\"/\"Rain\" was the single where they moved away from  their great subject of love, and where Ringo Starr perfected his uncanny  ability to shift the beat just enough that the band seemed to be hovering  a few inches above the ground. George Harrison's \"The Inner Light\"-- a  spaced-out setting from the Tao Te Ching, on which he's backed up by  Indian musicians-- is a momentum-killer in the context of an album (as  it is here), but it made sense as part of a yin-and-yang pair with Paul's  earthy Fats Domino homage \"Lady Madonna\".\"The Ballad of John and  Yoko\", rushed out seven weeks after \"Get Back\", looked  like a colossal act of vanity on its surface-- John messing with the  Lennon/McCartney copyright juggernaut by reporting so literally on what  he'd been up to for the past couple of months that the result was basically  impossible to cover, and getting Paul into the studio to bang it out  with him, even though Ringo and George were due back in town just a  few days later. It's a triumph, anyway.</p><p>As usual with their singles,  there's something new and ear-catching jumping out of the speakers every  few seconds (the shaker that doubles the rhythm right after the bridge,  Paul's improvised-sounding last-word-of-each-line harmonies, John singing  \"Gibraltar near Spain\" at a moment when that was a political  assertion), and honestly Lennon had been having a pretty interesting  spring.And then there's their biggest-selling  single and deepest pairing of songs, \"Hey Jude\"/\"Revolution\". McCartney is singing about Lennon's son, Lennon is shouting about the  system and culture about which they're embedded; \"Jude\" wraps  its arms around the world and gets everyone to join in its mantra, \"Revolution\"  pushes the idiots away with the nastiest noise the Beatles had ever  made. It was also the first release on the Beatles' own label, Apple  Records-- or, rather, one of two singles that came out the same day.  (The other was Mary Hopkin's \"Those Were the Days\", which  knocked it off the top of the British charts after a couple of weeks.)  As a seven-minute song on an album of three-minute songs, \"Hey  Jude\" inevitably overpowers its context; as a free-floating sound  file without \"Revolution\", it's missing the sting that tempers  its sweetness. But if you find yourself taking advantage of the reissue-and-\"Rock Band\" frenzy to sit down and really listen to the magnificent recordings  that have spent the last four decades or so as inescapable background  music, remember the way much of these two discs were meant to be heard and understood:  two by two.[Note: Click here for an overview of the 2009 Beatles reissues, including discussion of the packaging and sound quality.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Douglas Wolk, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Jeff Beck's Truth -- which was already regarded as the pioneering heavy metal blues album of its era, beating Led Zeppelin to the punch by about six months -- got a lot better with this British import remastered reissue, which puts all prior editions of the CD to shame. EMI Records have remastered the original LP in 24-bit digital, which puts Beck's guitar and John Paul Jones' organ on \"You Shook Me\" practically in your lap, and the amp on the former almost up against your ear, and Mickey Waller's drums and Ron Wood's bass on \"Shapes of Things\" into a position of similar intimacy, so you can almost hear the action on the bass strings. And Rod Stewart's voice is not only close but flows out with a resonance that can't entirely be covered by his rasping delivery -- \"Ol' Man River\" now seems like an ideal choice for him (as well as a distant precursor to his later recordings of standards), and Keith Moon's timpani performance is totally larger-than-life here. Beck's guitar sounds like it's in the room with you on \"Rock My Plimsoul,\" and Stewart's singing is presented in such detail, that his nuances now seem fine and intimate. There are so many details revealed in the playing here in this remastering, that even longtime listeners are certain to find nuances in the playing and the different parts that are new to them -- and that's just the established album.</p><p>The original ten songs have been very judiciously augmented with a brace of killer bonus tracks, starting with \"I've Been Drinking,\" where Rod Stewart first treaded into Sam Cooke territory stylistically, which somehow never got included on the LP and ended up relegated to the B-side of the Beck single \"Love Is Blue\" in mono (it's in stereo here, natch); there's also the undubbed, stripped-down first take of \"You Shook Me,\" filled with instruments that are nice and close and crunchy (especially the guitar); the early, single-take of \"Rock My Plimsoul,\" remixed to stereo here; \"Beck's Bolero\" in its original mono single version; the previously unissued first take of the shattering \"Blues De Luxe\"; and the early single A-sides \"Tallyman,\" \"Love Is Blue,\" and \"Hi Ho Silver Lining,\" the first and last featuring Beck's own singing (a decision imposed by producer Mickie Most over the guitarist's vociferous objections) the latter in its unedited form with a \"wee surprise\" at the very end. It's worth the upgrade -- you may well find yourself practically getting high off the raw invention and passions oozing from virtually all of the music, and even playing it once for some younger friends who've heard it before will make a few converts to its cause.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>"

Released in 1975, Beck's fifth effort as a leader and first instrumental album was a marked departure from its more rock-based predecessors. Only composer/keyboardist Max Middleton returned from Beck's previous lineups. To Beck's credit, Blow by Blow features a tremendous supporting cast. Middleton's tasteful use of the Fender Rhodes, clavinet, and analog synthesizers leaves a soulful imprint. Drummer Richard Bailey is in equal measure supportive and propulsive as he deftly combines elements of jazz and funk with contemporary mixed meters. Much of the album's success is also attributable to the excellent material, which includes Middleton's two originals and two collaborations with Beck, a clever arrangement of Lennon and McCartney's \"She's a Woman,\" and two originals by Stevie Wonder. George Martin's ingenious production and string arrangements rival his greatest work. Beck's versatile soloing and diverse tones are clearly the album's focus, and he proves to be an adept rhythm player. Blow by Blow is balanced by open-ended jamming and crisp ensemble interaction as it sidesteps the bombast that sank much of the jazz-rock fusion of the period. One of the album's unique qualities is the sense of fun that permeates the performances. On the opening \"You Know What I Mean,\" Beck's stinging, blues-based soloing is full of imaginative shapes and daring leaps. On \"Air Blower,\" elaborate layers of rhythm, duel lead, and solo guitars find their place in the mix. Propelled by the galvanic rhythm section, Beck slashes his way into \"Scatterbrain,\" where a dizzying keyboard and guitar line leads to more energetic soloing from Beck and Middleton. In Stevie Wonder's ballad \"Cause We've Ended as Lovers,\" Beck variously coaxes and unleashes sighs and screams from his guitar in an aching dedication to Roy Buchanan. Middleton's aptly titled \"Freeway Jam\" best exemplifies the album's loose and fun-loving qualities, with Beck again riding high atop the rhythm section's wave. As with \"Scatterbrain,\" Martin's impeccable string arrangements enhance the subtle harmonic shades of the closing \"Diamond Dust.\" Blow by Blow signaled a new creative peak for Beck, and it proved to be a difficult act to follow. It is a testament to the power of effective collaboration and, given the circumstances, Beck clearly rose to the occasion. In addition to being a personal milestone, Blow by Blow ranks as one of the premiere recordings in the canon of instrumental rock music.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Kirschenmann</strong></p>"

Propelled by the galvanic rhythm section, Beck slashes his way into \"Scatterbrain,\" where a dizzying keyboard and guitar line leads to more energetic soloing from Beck and Middleton. In Stevie Wonder's ballad \"Cause We've Ended as Lovers,\" Beck variously coaxes and unleashes sighs and screams from his guitar in an aching dedication to Roy Buchanan. Middleton's aptly titled \"Freeway Jam\" best exemplifies the album's loose and fun-loving qualities, with Beck again riding high atop the rhythm section's wave. As with \"Scatterbrain,\" Martin's impeccable string arrangements enhance the subtle harmonic shades of the closing \"Diamond Dust.\" Blow by Blow signaled a new creative peak for Beck, and it proved to be a difficult act to follow. It is a testament to the power of effective collaboration and, given the circumstances, Beck clearly rose to the occasion. In addition to being a personal milestone, Blow by Blow ranks as one of the premiere recordings in the canon of instrumental rock music.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Kirschenmann</strong></p>"

Walden also contributes four compositions, including the funk-infused \"Come Dancing,\" which adds an unnamed horn section. While Walden's \"Sophie\" is overly long and marred by Hammer's arena rock clichés, his \"Play With Me\" is spirited and Hammer's soloing more melodic. Acoustic guitar and piano predominate the closing ballad, \"Love Is Green\"; Beck's electric solo gracefully massages the quiet timbres. Wired is well balanced by looser, riff-oriented material and Walden's more intricate compositions. Walden and Hammer give Wired a '70s-era jazz-rock flavor that is indicative of their work with the Mahavishnu Orchestra.

One of Wired's finest tracks is an arrangement of Charles Mingus' \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.\" Beck's playing is particularly alluring: cleanly ringing tones, weeping bends, and sculpted feedback form a resonant palette. Bailey and Middleton lend supple support. Within a two-year span, the twin towers Blow by Blow and Wired set a standard for instrumental rock that even Beck has found difficult to match.

		"review": "<p>Jeff Beck has never shied away from following trends, at least as far as the musical styles he uses to back up his signature guitar sound. Back in 1969, in a sleeve note on Beck-Ola, he noted that he hadn't come up with \"anything totally original,\" and instead made an album \"with the accent on heavy music\" at a time when the \"heavy music\" of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Led Zeppelin was all the rage. In 1975, at the height of the jazz fusion movement, he made a jazz fusion album, and a good one, too. In both cases, however, the fashionable genres only provided a contemporary-sounding context in which his playing could flourish. If anyone has ever needed to be inspired to work, it's this recluse. So on his first regular studio album of new material in ten years, Who Else!, Beck, on at least a few tracks, solos over heavily percussive techno tracks reminiscent of Prodigy. But whether he's piercing such a rhythmic wall, rearranging the blues on the live \"Blast From the East,\" or floating over an ambient soundscape on \"Angel (Footsteps),\" it's the same old Beck, with his stinging and sustained single-note melodies, his harmonics, his contrasting tones, his drive. And the man who played \"Greensleeves\" straight on Truth in 1968 is the same one who is faithful to the Irish air \"Declan\" here. Older fans who haven't been spending time at raves in recent years may want to program their CDs to avoid the electronica, but they should at least give those tunes a listen -- are they any heavier than the \"heavy music\" of 1969?</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

From the moment the electronicized, post-rave beats of \"Earthquake\" kick off the record, it's clear that Beck isn't content to stay in place -- he's trying to adapt to the modern world. To a certain extent, this isn't an entirely new phenomenon, since each of his records is clearly, inextricably of its time, from the crunching metal of Truth through the breezy jazz fusion of Blow By Blow to the modernized album rock of Guitar Shop. This is just another side of that, as Beck works with electronic music, both noisy and new age introspective. It's a bit clever, actually, since Beck's playing has always been otherworldly, dipping, bending, and sounding like anything other than a normal guitar. The problem is, when he's surrounded by lockstep, processed beats and gurgling synths, his guitar doesn't leap to the forefront and capture attention the way it does on his best recordings. Still, there's something to be said for the effort, because even if it doesn't sound like a Beck record, it isn't a bad record, and it's certainly a helluva lot more successful than Clapton's similar forays into these waters. Besides, knowing that he knocked this out so quickly makes it a little endearing.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Anyone who caught Jeff Beck's set at Eric Clapton's 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival (or even the two-song DVD excerpt) was probably salivating at the hope that an entire performance with the same band would appear on CD and DVD. This is it, 72 minutes and 16 tracks compiled from a week of shows at the U.K.'s famed Ronnie Scott's, and it's as impressive as any Beck fan would expect. The guitarist's last official U.S.-released live disc was from his 1976 Wired tour (an authorized \"bootleg\" of his 2006 tour with bassist Pino Palladino is available at gigs and online; others pop up as expensive imports), making the appearance of this music from just over three decades later a long-awaited, much-anticipated event.</p><p>Only one track, the frenzied \"Scatterbrain,\" is repeated here from the 1976 album, but with an entirely different, and arguably more sympathetic, band backing him along with a far longer playing time, this disc is the stronger of the two. Veteran drummer Vinnie Colaiuta nimbly keeps the beat, Jason Rebello's keyboards aren't nearly as intrusive as Jan Hammer's, and young bassist Tal Wilkenfeld's rubbery lines both underpin and, in the case of \"Cause We've Ended as Lovers,\" take the lead when called on with vibrant proficiency and a sure sense of the bottom end needed for Beck's excursions into funk, fusion, reggae, jazz, and rock. The entirely instrumental concert focuses predominantly where you'd expect it to -- on Beck's innovative leads as he tears into his catalog of fusion fare, going back to Blow by Blow, with a surprise opening of \"Beck's Bolero\" from his Jeff Beck Group rock years. A short rendition of Charles Mingus' \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" that segues into a tense \"Brush with the Blues\" is a disc highlight, as it shows Beck pulling out many of his six-string tricks and taps into his blues background. \"Space Boogie\" gives drummer Colaiuta a chance to shine with double-speed licks, and affords keyboardist Rebello a spotlight for his jazz piano skills. But it's Beck who slams into the track with aggressive fluidity, shooting out sizzling solos as the band pushes him along. His sensitive cover of the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life,\" a longtime live staple, is a showstopper bringing Beck's intensity to an arrangement that has stops, starts, and unexpected turns and is, like the guitarist, never predictable. Through it all, Beck's guitar sings, cries, moans, and shouts with as much emotion as a vocalist, showing that an instrument can sing as effectively as a human being, but only in the right hands.</p> <p>&mdash;Hal Horowitz</p>"

Joined by dobroist Tut Taylor, who had played with Blake on John Hartford's Aereo-Plain earlier in the year, the two run through a delightful mix of old-time songs and Blake originals, many of which show the progressive characteristics that would lead the guitarist to form the Rising Fawn String Ensemble to play what was called \"hillbilly baroque.\" Although he only got better over time, this record is among Blake's best, demonstrating his nearly incomparable virtuosity, easygoing style, and broad repertoire, highlighted by \"Cattle in the Cane,\" \"Crossing No. 9,\" and the lovely closer \"Spanish Fandango,\" which according to the notes is the first song he ever learned to play.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jim Smith</strong></p>"

Originally released on Takoma in 1976, it was out of print for years before an overwhelming fan petition prompted a reissue of the album in 1999. The sound is marvelous and, as one would expect, there's a ton of fine flatpicking here, as well as a rare chance to hear Blake live and in his prime. Joined by then-wife Nancy on three cuts, Blake switches to fiddle for a few tunes, including the lovely \"Border Widow.\" His rendition of \"Nine Pound Hammer\" is one of the best on record, and equally great is a loose arrangement of \"Arkansas Traveler\" that finds a number of other half melodies and improvisations darting in and out. Some of these tunes turned up on previous and later studio albums; some he would never record again.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jim Smith</strong></p>"

This album finds Blake's artistry already fully developed, with the material divided between traditional songs and instrumentals. All nine cuts feature Blake's nifty guitar and mandolin work, with occasional back up from Nancy Blake on cello. The album gets started with a Tin Pan Alley tune, \"Are You from Dixie?,\" an upbeat song that plays off the motif of the lonely Southerner away from his homeland and longing for a friendly face. On the oddly titled \"The Rights of Man Hornpipe\" Blake is backed by Nancy Blake on cello, creating something akin to flatpicking Baroque. When the cello is combined with the fiddle on \"D Medley,\" the sound comes much closer to a medium-paced Appalachian jig. The original \"Lonesome Jenny\" fits comfortably with the album's traditional material, drawing a portrait of the empty life of a woman who has been left a widow. This seven-minute portrait is filled with fascinating chord changes and tender lyrics. All of the songs on Blackberry Blossom are delivered in Blake's straightforward manner, both down-to-earth and emotive. It is perhaps easy to take an artist as uncomplicated as Blake for granted: he never seems to be going out of his way to impress the listener with fancy guitar licks or vocal hysterics. Instead, he imbeds himself in tradition, offering honest interpretations and fresh originals that are respectful of their roots. In this way, his true artistry grows each time the listener hears Blackberry Blossom.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ronnie D. Lankford</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Blind Faith's lone album is often considered vivid proof as to why superstar collaborations simply don't work, but that is a little unfair -- in contrast to, say, Chess Records' various Super Blues releases, which stuck top musicians such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf together in awkward combos that they didn't really want to be part of, the guys in Blind Faith really were trying to work together on a long-term basis, and had an affinity for each other's work; the group just never had the time to evolve properly. And in retrospect, the album does have something to offer, including two songs that are touchstones of classic late-'60s rock: \"Can't Find My Way Home\" and \"Presence of the Lord,\" not to mention the bracing \"Sea of Joy.\" \"Had to Cry Today\" is also pretty effective, as is the Buddy Holly cover \"Well All Right.\" Still, for those who subscribe to conventional rock critic doctrine, it may seem a little strange that an album as muddied as Blind Faith was given this lavish Deluxe Edition, containing basically everything capable of being released that the group cut during these sessions. This expanded edition will not change any minds; just on principle, it may even sour some open-minded listeners who have a distaste for extended, seemingly endless jams; in the latter regard, anyone so inclined should probably skip all but the third track on the second disc entirely, since three of the four jams that comprise the nearly hourlong platter are the least interesting of the bonus materials, even if some moments work well -- Eric Clapton's electric guitar playing is always interesting, and when Steve Winwood's organ kicks in there's a fair degree of excitement, though not without a lot of meandering before and after.</p><p>But the bonus tracks appended to the basic album on the first disc -- which runs a whopping 75 minutes -- are a different matter. These include two previously unreleased versions of \"Sleeping in the Ground\" (the one on Crossroads is missing), an electric version of \"Can't Find My Way Home\" that's just about worth the price of admission, and \"Time Winds.\" If one compares this double-disc set to, say, The Layla Sessions triple-CD box, there's more here, if only because this group still had so many rough edges to work out that are worth a listen, whereas the completed Derek & the Dominos Layla album did, indeed, distill down the best of that band's work. With Blind Faith, there was still a lot of ground to cover musically, although \"Acoustic Jam\" will probably not be on too many listeners' playlists more than once or twice, except for some aspects of Eric Clapton's and Rick Grech's playing -- this track may be the earliest instance (albeit an unintended one, as it wasn't ever supposed to see the light of day) justifying the criticism that sometimes gets hung on Steve Winwood's multi-instrumentalist status, that he is a jack of all trades and master of none, because his piano playing here just isn't very interesting. The fact remains that -- even with these new tracks and the lavish presentation -- this is a muddled album, but like The Layla Sessions it's still a hell of a set for the dedicated, filled with unheard music, good liners, and beautiful packaging. Those who do love the album or the work of the musicians involved will not be disappointed by this, and may well find new moments of fascination in the best of the jams. [The two bonus tracks that appeared on the original late-'80s CD release of Blind Faith are not here, as it was subsequently discovered that they were Rick Grech demos that didn't involve the rest of the band.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>That Rory Block is an astonishingly capable blues artist has been evident for many years, but with this tribute to the legendary Eddie J. \"Son\" House Jr., her cache is elevated even further. The shifty and slinky flexible slide work of House, and his preachy, shout chorus style vocalizing is perfectly exemplified on his tunes by Block. What is wondrous is that Block loses nothing of her personal sound and identity, as if she is mystically channeling the acoustic blues icon through some higher powered means. Block's pure and simple solo persona is electrified through many of House's classic tunes and some well chosen others, and she does them all proud. Everyone will enjoy and appreciate her spot-on take of \"Death Letter,\" 12-bar train inspired \"Depot Blues\" featuring her immaculate slide guitar work, and the inspired devices, phrasings, and fervent singing on the energetic \"Preachin' Blues.\" \"Grinnin' in Your Face\" is perhaps the most beloved tune of Son House, the tale of two-faced, untrustworthy people she sings with a slight echo or reverb in her voice that is truly haunting. Tales of a bad luck lover on \"Jinx Blues\" is as deep and personal as authentic blues gets, while the back porch moanin' \"Low Down Dirty Dog Blues\" echoes the pre-Howlin' Wolf style House founded. Listeners need to be advised that Rory Block is not photocopying these songs as much as she is assimilating them with her own voice, but in the pure and unique original voicings Son House invented. The loping \"Country Farm Blues\" and signature tune \"Shetland Pony Blues\" show the extreme passion and depth Block feels in this music. There are asides away from the guitar/vocal approach, as overdubbed vocals on \"Dry Spell Blues,\" the more folksy \"I Want to Go Home on the Morning Train,\" or an occasional harmonica insert by John Sebastian add a little variety. A most highly recommended recording that easily stands next to her previously recorded tribute to Robert Johnson, Blues Walkin' Like a Man ranks among Rory Block's very best efforts in her long, satisfying career, and is a welcome reminder of how a handful artists like Son House truly revolutionized American music.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Michael G.

In 2009, he named his seventh studio album The Ballad of John Henry after one of the most enduring tales in American folk music. The difference between these two songs should signal a great difference between the two albums and that's true, to a certain extent. The Ballad of John Henry is heavy on myth-making that translates to heavy guitars on several occasions, particularly on the epic six-minute title track, whose roiling minor-key riffs, orchestrations, and excursions into acoustic instruments are closer to prog than blues. While the rest of the record never gets as overblown as this, it shares similar thick sonics and a sober sensibility, an approach that treats Ike & Tina Turner's \"Funkier Than a Mosquito's Tweeter\" as sacred text and straightens out Tom Waits' \"Jockey Full of Bourbon.\" This sobriety means that The Ballad isn't a whole lot of fun -- when Bonamassa sings that he's \"Feelin' Good,\" it feels a bit like drudgery -- but this dogged approach does give the album some self-serious heft, adding the impression of weight that fits a record that feels like a summation of his strengths. His guitar and voice carry equal weight as he runs through SRV-styled slow blues, a shuffle or two, acoustic numbers, covers, and originals -- everything that he's dabbled with on previous albums is pulled together here, making for his most varied album and possibly his best, even if that heaviness means that it's not necessarily the easiest to enjoy.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

King to guest on his eighth album Black Rock -- and if what you’re doing is good enough to rope B.B. in, there’s not much reason to change, so Bonamassa doesn’t tinker with his formula here, retaining a little of the folky undertow of The Ballad of John Henry, but with its remaining roots in a thick, heavy blues-rock more redolent of ‘60s London than the ‘50s Delta. Of course, Bonamassa has never shied away from his love of Brit-blues, even underscoring it with a good streamlined cover of Jeff Beck’s “Spanish Boots,” but he retains a healthy respect for all manners of classic blues, kicking out a Chicago groove on a cover of Otis Rush’s “Three Times a Fool,” reaching back to Blind Boy Fuller for “Baby You Gotta Change Your Mind” and ably replicating B.B.’s latter-day soul groove on a horn-smacked cover of Willie Nelson’s “Night Life.” Bonamassa has an ear for non-blues writers too, cherrypicking Leonard Cohen’s “Bird on a Wire” and John Hiatt’s “I Know a Place,” tying it all together with beefy lead lines, but the provocative moments on Black Rock are all self-penned, whether it’s the clattering stomp “When the Fire Hits the Sea,” the British folk lilt of “Quarryman’s Lament” and “Athens to Athens,” or the droning dramatic epic “Blue and Evil.” These are easily the most intriguing songs here, suggesting Bonamassa realizes that the familiar covers allow him to stretch out elsewhere, and while it might be interesting hearing him follow this path for a full album, what’s here on Black Rock is both satisfying and admirably, if reservedly, ambitious.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

When Bonamassa played the Beacon Theatre in New York City in November 2011, the marquee declared it \"the guitar event of the year,\" and something that important would certainly merit another live album, wouldn't it? Beacon Theatre: Live from New York is a hefty two-disc set that features plenty of Bonamassa's trademark guitar work, at once precise and bombastic and firmly rooted in the traditions of British blues, and for this show he had Paul Rodgers on hand to lend appropriately swaggering lead vocals to a pair of Free covers, \"Fire and Water\" and \"Walk in My Shadows.\" Two other guest singers pop up on this set: John Hiatt, whose craggy tone lends a welcome bit of texture to versions of two of his tunes, \"Down Around My Place\" and \"I Know a Place,\" and Beth Hart, who has collaborated with Bonamassa in the past and lends her voice to spirited versions of \"Sinner's Prayer\" and \"I'll Take Care of You.\" There's no arguing the technical skill of Bonamassa and his band (Carmine Rojas on bass, Rick Melick on keys, and Tal Bergman on drums), who perform with the accuracy of a Swiss watch, but some might question his taste -- there's nothing the least bit subtle about Bonamassa's big, burly sound, and the emotional shadings of these songs are pretty much trampled into the dirt by the end of disc one, while the presence of the guest stars unfortunately reminds listeners that Bonamassa's vocals are not on a par with his skills on the fretboard. But if you're already a convert, Beacon Theatre: Live from New York finds Bonamassa playing with all his might for a crowd who are clearly digging what he has to offer, and if, like many of his fans, you're convinced he sounds stronger and more powerful on-stage, this album will tide you over nicely until he next rolls into your area.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

Impressive to say the least.</p><p>‘One Less Cross To Bear’ (which you can download for free at the end of this review) is a new song, more of a break down played live as the rhythm section keep it nice and tight, allowing Joe’s guitar to sing until Reese Wyans lets loose with a glorious keyboard solo.  Not to be outdone, Tai Bergman and Lenny Castro join in with a percussion run. Glorious.<p>We then get all acoustic for Dustbowl, which is my current (out of many) favourite JB song and is played stripped down here.  It certainly shows another side to Joe’s playing, that he is in fact more than just “a blues player” he is in fact a great guitar player.</p><p>The great thing about Joe is that he is not afraid to experiment, to work with different people and styles, as witnessed on Joe’s half acoustic/half electric tour (of which these two shows were a part), in particular when he welcomed Irish fiddler Gerry O’Connor onto the stage for ‘Still Water’.</p><p>The title track from his last studio album ‘Different Shades Of Blue’ is equally as impressive and features a wonderful Nyckelharpa solo from Mats Wester.</p><p>The electric band is back for ‘Never Give All Your Heart’, out of an eerie opening section Joe’s guitar sound comes flying, soaring with melody and tone, truly an uplifting song if ever there was one.</p><p>A wonderful Reese Wyans intro for another new song, ‘So, What Would I Do’ brings the show to a close, featuring a great Paulie Cerra saxophone solo, Joe really does allow his fellow musicians a chance to shine.</p><p>With enough old material to keep the die-hards happy and enough new material to keep everybody else happy, this is much more than a live album, this is a life event.</p><p>The DVD contains all the songs as featured on the CD, plus a lot more besides, including over 2.5 hours of live footage, and a special 45-minute behind-the-scenes featurette.</p><p><strong>&mdash;David Farrell</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>‘Live at the Greek Theatre’ is Joe Bonamassa’s fourteenth live album and his tenth live album since 2012, the year in which Joe’s career (burnished by 2011’s remarkable ‘Dust bowl’) went into overdrive. Whereas such a quotient of live albums could seem an extravagance, with Joe, the live shows form an essential part of his catalogue. Each show is a chance to reinvent, and it is simply not in Joe’s nature to take the easy route and simply play the hits. Instead, Joe’s shows are an exploration in which he challenges himself and the audience, offering up radical reinterpretations (‘An acoustic evening at the Vienna opera house’), blistering hard-rock blues (‘Beacon Theatre – live from New York) and stunning tributes to great musicians (‘Muddy Wolf – Live at Red Rocks’). Of these, it is the latter – ‘Muddy Wolf’ – which proved unequivocally that a live album can be every bit as crucial as a studio record and, for SonicAbuse, the album was listed as one of the best records of 2015.</p><p>2016 has been no less a great year for Joe. March saw the release of the wonderful ‘Blues of Desperation’ yet, rather than simply tour the album, Joe went out on the road to celebrate a succession of inspirational blues artists. In the UK Joe paid tribute to three legends of British Blues: Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, in an event that we described as ‘once in a lifetime’. Those concerts were filmed for posterity, but before that films sees the light of day, we are blessed with a recording of Joe’s special US tour in which the Three Kings – Freddie, B.B. and Albert – were celebrated. Joe handpicked each set and treats the music with respect whilst simultaneously making it over in his own unique style. Joe’s passion and enthusiasm for the blues drives the project, his remarkable talent on the guitar gilds it and his stunning band (“the greatest band in the world” Joe reminds us) polish it to a mirror shine. This is what all live recordings should be and it looks likely that Joe Bonamassa will have two albums in our end of year list this time around!</p><p>As with most Bonamassa releases, this is a multi-format release and fans can choose from double CD, double DVD, Blu ray and 3 LP editions. Our review copy is the double DVD, which features not only the performance itself (sensibly placed solely on disc one to minimize compression), but also a fistful of extras including Behind the scenes clips, an illuminating interview with Joe’s parents and a music video for ‘Riding with the kings’. Those who have purchased Bonamassa releases before will know that there’s a firm emphasis on quality and this release is no exception. Beautifully filmed in HD, the DVD looks as crisp and clear as it is possible for the format to look (and one can imagine that the Blu Ray looks yet better) and everything from the deep red of Bonamassa’s beautiful Gibson ES330 to the inky blacks of the backstage area are captured in impressive detail. Of course, whilst the image in important, it is the audio that is of paramount important and the disc does not disappoint. Mixed, as always, by Kevin Shirley there’s a choice of stunning DTS 5.1 mix and PCM 2.0. and, whichever mix you go for, it’s virtually impossible to fault. For the most part the music floods from the front speakers whilst the rears are used for subtle ambience which gives the music depth without appearing gimmicky. In other words, it’s yet another reference presentation from Joe and this is one disc you’ll want to break out a lot.</p><p>The film starts with a short introduction which captures a TV clip showing the thirteen-year-old Joe already making a name for himself as a guitarist. It’s an illuminating piece that considers that elusive question of authority within the blues, questioning the extent to which a young man with few troubles in life can relate to the blues. The clip leaves this down to the incisive B.B. King who simply says “You don’t know where the children get this from… but all I know is he got it!” One does not argue with the master and, by the end of this epic concert, it’s irrefutable that Joe not only has the blues, but that he has them bad. On stage it’s all too easy to see that thirteen-year-old boy, still dreaming of the stars and paying tribute to those that went before him in the only way he knows how, and it is proof that sometimes, in this dark world, dreams do come true.</p><p>In truth I sat down to review this DVD a few days ago, only to leave my laptop to one side whilst I simply sat and became absorbed. Some DVDs can leave you feeling cold, like you’re sat outside the window, looking in at a great party, but this does a fantastic job of placing you right at the heart of the action. From Kevin’s immersive mix to the well-edited shots that impeccably capture each musician on the somewhat crowded stage, Phillipe Klose has done a fabulous job of bringing it all together and deserves great credit for balancing the energy of the performance with a restraint that allows the camera to linger rather than jump cut in what has become an increasingly irritating style in live music video. From the moment that the smooth blues of ‘See see baby’ comes rolling in, augmented by the glorious brass arrangements of Lee Thornburg, it’s impossible to stem a rising feeling of joy driven by the music. That sense of euphoria only grows as Anton Fig’s rolling percussion announces the arrival of ‘some other day, some other time’ which is a perfect ensemble piece, capturing each musician in their element. What makes it so perfect is not the musicianship itself (impressive as it is), it’s the fact that these veterans are so obviously having the time of their lives playing this wonderful music and even though this is a recording, the emotion is so strong that you can’t help but be swayed by it. This is music of the heart and soul, and both Bonamassa and his band understand that all too well, delivering a performance that captures that very human essence of the blues. Things really start to cook with ‘sittin’ on the boat dock’ and ‘going down’, both of which crackle with enough energy to power the national grid. It’s a reminder that this is no ordinary concert, but a celebration of all that is wonderful in blues music, and if ‘Going down’ doesn’t make you want to leap from your seat and dance, then it is entirely possible that you need to seek medical advice regarding the operational capability of your adrenal glands.</p><p>With the crowd’s ecstatic applause ringing in the speakers throughout the introduction of the song, ‘I’ll play the blues for you’ takes things down a notch, as if any further displays like ‘going down’ would result in spontaneous combustion. Joe appears with Lucy, Albert King’s beautiful, vintage Gibson flying V, although it is second guitarist Kirk Fletcher to whom Joe graciously cedes the spotlight for some truly heroic soloing. Similarly, Reece Wynans (Keyboards) and the brass section get plenty of time to shine on ‘I get Evil’, although it is the sweet groove of ‘Breaking up somebody’s home’ (powered by Michael Rhodes) that serves as a stunning mid-set highlight with some of the feature’s most astounding soloing yet seen. Equally powerful is ‘Angel of mercy’, a hulking blues monster neatly paired with the sweet groove of ‘Cadillac Assembly line’ and so the set progresses, Joe once again showing that his gift of sequencing the sets for maximum impact has not deserted him. Very much an integral part of the show are singers Mahalia Barnes, Jade Macrae and Juanita Tippins, who add so much to the night and get a moment to shine with the glorious gospel harmonies of ‘Ole time religion’. Their presence sweetens even the darkest blues and they remain absolutely graceful even as Joe blazes away on his guitar on tracks such as ‘nobody loves me but my mother’. The set concludes with the classics ‘born under a bad sign’ and the evergreen ‘the thrill is gone’. It’s a poignant and beautiful tribute to Joe’s friend and mentor, B.B. King whose loss is still keenly felt by the entire blues community. It is also the perfect conclusion to a concert that does not put a single foot wrong over the course of twenty-two well-chosen tracks.</p><p>‘Live at the Greek theatre’ is a reference quality DVD/Blu Ray that allows viewers to watch one of the world’s greatest guitarists paying tribute to three of the Blues’ greatest artists alongside a band that is absolutely without equal. Joe Bonamassa does not have to do these tours. A respected and talented song writer, he could simply tour his hits and have done. These shows are special because they are a project born purely out of a love for the music and a gratitude for the inspiration that is quite impossible to counterfeit. From the start Joe’s heart and soul is on display and the connection he makes with the audience is glorious to behold. Not many artists can make a live recording so remarkable, but Joe’s performance here is so bold, impassioned and beautiful that this record (and its parent tour) will still be talked about in decades to come.</p>"

Bonamassa still spits out a flurry of notes -- that's his signature -- but the acoustic setting softens his aggression, and his band follows suit. The songs aren't so much reinterpreted as given a gentler touch, and in a catalog filled with similar feeling records, that distinction is welcome.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>'British Blues Explosion Live' is the latest conceptual vehicle for the prodigiously talented Joe Bonamassa and his constant search for a meaningful context with which to keep the blues alive.</p><p>Playing to a seated outdoor crowd at The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, he's probably playing to the very people who bought the original material and helped cross over blues into hard rock in the late 60's.</p><p>Where The Yardbirds exported the British Blues Invasion in the mid-sixties, little over 50 years later, Bonamassa is reversing the trend by recycling past glories, while adding his own colours in a reminder of how we came to this point musically.</p><p>Bonamassa's high standing in the rock/blues community is a result of the cleverly interweaving of his self penned material with that of salient British blues rockers.</p><p>His first half a dozen studio albums significantly drew on material by Rory Gallagher, Free, Ian Anderson, Beck and Stewart, Steve Winwood, Plant and Page, Alvin Lee and even John Martyn, so while his own song writing has grown significantly he's imperceptibly dragged the old Blues Invasion crowd with him.</p><p>This brings us to the 'British Blues Explosion Live', a double CD/DVD pack which finds Bonamassa indulging himself in personal favourites from as far back as 1966 with John Mayall's Blues Breakers' 'Little Girl', and as recently as Eric Clapton's 1989 'Pretending', on which he adds an eloquently layered solo.</p><p>Clapton would seem to be closest to his heart, but he sets out his stall with the fiery Jimmy Page penned 'Beck's Bolero', as he successfully emulates the latter's fiery intensity.</p><p>'Mainline Florida', mirrors Clapton's gradual conversion to the mainstream and the undoubted southern flavour is aided by the significant bv's of Russ Irwin.</p><p>Beck's 'Let Me Love You Baby' pushes Joe's vocal to the limit. He's smart enough not to attempt to emulate Rod Stewart's vocal grit on 'Plynth (Water Down the Drain)', but settles for exploring one of rock's greatest riffs which is well suited to his ability.</p><p>He's a precise player who is happiest when exploring concise notes and different tonal colours, rather than the strutting figure who tries manfully to reign in Zeppelin on 'How Many More Times.'</p><p>He immerses himself in Beck's 'Spanish Boots', and though the vocal is a bit thin he's got the safety net of Anton Fig's blustery support. He then reaches back to 1966 for Bluesbreaker Clapton's 'Double Crossing Time' which provides the most intense performance of the first set and reminds us that this really is the stuff that ignited a generation.</p><p>He eschews slide on Clapton's 'Motherless Children' and settles for a cleaner tone as he builds up a head of steam alongside Reese Wynans' organ.  Then there's a humorous contextual intro to Cream's 'SWLABR', as the camera cleverly shifts from a wide shot to a close up of Bonamassa building up the intensity of the younger Clapton's licks.</p><p>The crowd is too far away to make a meaningful connection with the performer, but he cleverly draws them in with the subtle dynamics on Zeppelin's 'Tea For One.'</p><p>Not too many folks could have anticipated the clever segueing of his own 'Black Winter' (a rehash of The Yardbirds 'White Summer'), and 'Django'. The latter instrumental personifies his intricate instrumental work and it provides the quiet before the storm.</p><p>Zeppelin's 'How Many More Times' is almost a step too far, as Joe is caught between his love of bone crunching riffs and the vocal gravitas needed to deliver both the original song and a few lines from 'The Hunter'.</p><p>Happily his ballistic finish does enough to spark the communal flashback that his audience subconsciously came here for. 'British Blues Explosion Live' offers few surprises, but Bonamassa's focussed intensity and peerless technique gives him the right to update the genre.</p><p>The bonus material includes some footage of a tired looking JB in a Cavern T-shirt playing a bluesy version of George Harrison's 'Taxman', which is ironically filmed in black and white.</p><p>There's also an ad-hoc 'Brick in the wall' ceremony outside The Cavern in Liverpool, which offers us a snapshot of the capped Bonamassa far removed from his usual working clothes of suit and shades.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Pete Feenstra</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>One of Joe Bonamassa's primary influences was Eric Clapton, so the idea behind Royal Tea makes some sense: he spends the 2020 album saluting British blues. This may seem like a distinction without a difference, since Bonamassa has never shied away from Zeppelin nods on his albums, but Royal Tea does indeed sound different than his other studio albums. Working with his longtime producer Kevin Shirley, the guitarist conjures the spirit of the Jeff Beck Group and Free, relying on heavy, churning riffs but also opening up the jams so there are elastic, soulful accents that help give the record a bit of period authenticity. Flourishes like swaths of wah-wahs on \"I Didn't Think She Would Do It\" and the crawling Fleetwood Mac atmosphere of \"Beyond the Silence\" evoke the album-rock era as much as the fuzz-chord stomp of the title track and the ominous bass-driven riff-rocker \"Lookout Man.\" Bonamassa has plenty of opportunity to show his facility with synthesizing different classic guitarists -- there's a bit of Rory Gallagher and Peter Green to offset his Claptonisms -- but the best moment on Royal Tea is \"A Conversation with Alice,\" a chiming bit of soul-pop where he channels the best moments of Steve Marriott.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine </strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The thing to know about David Bowie's 1979 album Lodger is that there really isn't anything special to know: No creation myth, no alter ego, no 10-minute-long song-suites or spooky instrumentals or pretentious backstories about George Orwell and \"the squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak rock.\" Actually, Lodger might be the first David Bowie album marketed as nothing more than an album of recorded music by David Bowie. \"I would like to do something rivetingly new and, uh, earth shattering,\" he said in a radio interview a few days before the album's release. \"Every Saturday I want to do that!\" Then, self-mockery: \"Let's do something earth shattering. No, let's put the telly on.\" A few minutes later, his digression on the metaphorical impacts of science fiction on personal identity is interrupted by a dog. Like, a canine, whimpering aloud while Bowie unburdens himself about inner space. \"I know it's a bore, darling,\" he says to the dog, and everyone, including David Bowie, laughs.The dog had a point: Seriousness really can be boring after awhile, which might've occurred to Bowie after the cold white peaks of 1977's Low. Sensing that high art might be losing its flavor, he went on a long, generous tour called Isolar II during which he revived the entirety of 1972's Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, a gesture that in the context of his restlessly radical early-'70s career would've been like staging a Vegas revue. \"He's remembering that bone shot in 2001,\" Bowie says of the dog during the radio interview. \"What a waste of a bone!\" A showman by birth and narcissist by trade, Bowie could've easily been talking about himself.</p><p>Lodger has 10 songs, all of which are three to four minutes long. One is a great Talking Heads impression called \"D.J.\" and another is basically a Brian Eno song with vocals by David Bowie instead of Brian Eno (\"Red Sails\"). The music is punky and dramatic and a little odd, with detours into reggae and near-Eastern tonalities (\"Yassassin\") and nebulously exotic \"world\" sounds (\"African Night Flight\"), all filtered through the ears of a British guy with plenty of money and the imperial leeway to appropriate whatever he felt like. To this day, no musician has better mastered the hermetic intensity of cocaine, a drug that makes you want to have long conversations with everyone you've ever met without leaving your room.Prior to Lodger, Bowie's alien status was existential, metaphorical, general—a one-size-fits-all garment for anyone convinced they'd been born in the wrong time or with the wrong body. But for as many people who saw their idealized selves in Ziggy Stardust or Aladdin Sane, Lodger was the first time Bowie really seemed accessible—a character with flaws and frailties, petty thoughts and grocery lists; someone who doesn't just dabble in reality but lives in it. \"Look Back in Anger\" opens with a wild panorama of guitar before devolving into a story about an angel with a cough; \"D.J.\" is childish and bitchy; \"Boys Keep Swinging,\" which Bowie apparently wrote after listening to the Village People, actually does sound a little like the Village People but less secure in its sexuality. When David Bowie sings the word \"depression\" on \"Fantastic Voyage,\" it's like listening to Zeus complain about sorting lights and darks. The title alone reduces his myth to something banal and transactional: No longer the Lonely Starchild gracing us with his unusual point of view, we instead meet Safari Bowie, half-drunk tourist working out his masculinity issues by haggling with street vendors, Bowie the houseguest who can't stop talking about getting \"authentic\" tacos.</p><p>The first half of Lodger especially, with its cartoon jungles and mysterious Bedouins and Englishmen too dumb to stay out of trouble but too powerful to ever really be in it, belongs more to the colonial satire of Evelyn Waugh than late-'70s art rock. (Bowie said that \"African Night Flight\" in particular was inspired by a trip to Kenya where he met a bunch of old German pilots who seemed to spend most of their time getting drunk and the rest doing profitable crime in the bush.) Lodgers aren't heavenly beings; they're people with enough money to rent a room.All this didn't just humanize Bowie, it made him whole. By the time he'd released Lodger, he was 32, halfway divorced and trying to keep his drug thing in check, rich and famous and still staring down the long rest of his life. \"Radical genius\" would be nice, but so would making it to 1985 and having people still remember your name. In that sense, Lodger is an anxious, humble album, the sound of an artist ceding the wheel to a younger generation he'd be a fool to pretend he was part of. To let the culture take him out and chauffer him for a little while. Of course, he still had plenty to offer and spent the next 30 years offering it: The music videos, the generous celebrity, room-unifying songs like \"Modern Love\" and movies like Labyrinth, which introduced hundreds of thousands of '80s babies to Bowie the mischievous goblin king, prancing around in his tights. Stars might look pretty while they fall but all they leave when they hit earth is a big empty hole. Lodger is the moment when Bowie took a deep breath and started to fill it.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mike Powell, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The Tunisian oud genius has done it again. Anouar Brahem has issued only five records under his own name over the past decade, each more adventurous than the last, without compromising his original vision: for the music of his region to meet with the other music of Africa and Asia and create a delirious sound that is equal thirds past, present, and future, along the precipice of historical lineage. For Brahem there is no attempt to synthesize the globe, or even the sounds of the East with those of the West. He is content in his knowledge that sound is infinite, and that his tradition, as it evolves and expands into a deeper pan-African/trans-Asian whole, is more than large enough for a master musician to rummage through in one lifetime. Astrakan Café, the follow-up to his brilliant Thimar, is a smaller-sounding recording that reaches farther into the deep crags of the Balkans. With Barbaros Erköse on clarinet and the Indian and Turkish percussion stylings of the professor of somber precision, Lassad Hosni, Brahem's oud enters into a dialogue, musically, that has never before existed (though he has collaborated with both players previously). Erköse is a Turkish clarinetist of gypsy origin. His low, warm, rounded tones are consonant with the oud. Erköse plays equal parts music of the Balkan and Arab worlds with a tinge of the ancient klezmorim whispering their secrets through his horn. Despite the journeying these musicians do here, they never stray far from the takht, a small ensemble capable of improvising to the point of drunken ecstasy. Listening through Astrakan Café, you can hear the gypsy flamenco tied deeply to Indian ragas and even a kind of Eastern jazz. But there is no hyperactivity in it, no need to cram as many traditions as possible into one putridly excessive mix that expresses nothing but the novelty of the moment. Astrakan Café has many highlights: its two title tracks that have their roots in Russian and Azerbaijan music; \"Ashkabad,\" which is an improvisation on a melody from the folk music of Turkmenistan; \"Astara,\" a modal improvisation based on love songs from Azerbaijan; \"Halfounie,\" a segment from a Brahem-composed soundtrack inspired by the medina or marketplace in Tunis; and \"Parfum de Gitanie,\" which takes a fragment from Ethiopian sacred music, slows it to the point of stillness, and waxes lazily and jazzily over the top, with the oud and the clarinet trading syncopated eights. This is deeply personal, profound music. It is also highly iconographic, with timelessness woven through every measure. The only \"exotica\" on Astrakan Café is its \"otherness\" out of space and any discernable era. The tempos are languid and full of purpose, the dynamics clean and clearly demarcated, the tones and modes warm, rich, and linear. This would be traditional music if a tradition such as this -- which is original, though adapted from many sources on inspiration -- actually existed. Highly recommended</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

He's a contemplative player, and this melding with piano and accordion suits his style perfectly, as notes and ideas draw out marvelously. The interplay between musicians is as delicate as lace -- thoughtful, with everyone listening as much as playing. It's a record with many moments of great beauty, like the exquisite piano on \"C'est Ailleurs\" or the filigree touches between accordion and piano that decorate and nudge along many of the tracks. Brahem is a superb, if reserved, musician, as are his colleagues: Francois Couturier on piano and Jean-Louis Matinier on accordion. Together they trace something exquisite, an experience for the eras and the heart.</P>— <B>Chris Nickson</B>"

		"review": "<P>Over the past 15 years, Tunisian oud master Anouar Brahem has assembled a relatively small but profound body of work. A skilled improviser who refuses to be part of the historical authenticity argument, Brahem works from the same trio setting that performed on Le Pas du Chat Noir in 2002, with pianist François Couturier and accordionist Jean-Louis Matinier. The dialogue between these players is, despite the sparseness of the music and the considerable space employed, intense. The deep listening necessary in the improvised sections allows for a natural flow of ideas to emerge from silence. The compositions themselves are skeletal, with repeating, slowly evolving vamps and lyric lines. They offer, on the surface, a contemplative approach, and indeed can be heard that way. However, when dynamics, timbre, and chromatics are listened for, what takes place is rather astonishing. Each player walks to the middle of a composition, steps back and reenters after ideas by the others are introduced, producing a kind of organic improvisation seldom heard. This is not to say that the most structured works here, such as \"Vague/E la Nave Va,\" aren't full of meditative delight as well. They are, and there are vast spaces into which the listener can enter and disappear for a while -- not so much to drift and dream as to be absorbed in their hypnotic and repetitive beauty. \"Les Jardins de Ziryab\" begins with Matinier's accordion, which is answered by the oud and Brahem's voice, accompanying them both. It unfolds from the center out. \"Le Chambre, Var.\" begins, for this ensemble, at a trot. Couturier's chord voicing and Brahem's percussive approach create a winding musical narrative that Matinier's accordion underscores rhythmically. The keyboard and air pulse create a terrain where intricate melodic lines come out of modal and chromatic tensions. Ultimately, Brahem has given listeners another of his wondrous offerings, full of deceptively simple compositions that open into a secret world, one where beauty is so present that it is nearly unapproachable, and it is up to the listener to fill in the spaces offered them by this remarkable trio.</P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B>"

When Tyner himself plays on \"Song for Bilbao\" (one of two guest appearances), one can certainly tell the difference between master and pupil.

Larry Goldings' organ makes for an unusual quartet -- also including Brecker on tenor sax, frequent guest Pat Metheny on guitar, and one of three different drummers -- in that there is no bass. As a result, Metheny often fills in that role when he isn' t soloing. Goldings' touch is light, in contrast to the more intense playing of Brecker and Metheny. But it is the second new sideman who makes a difference: Elvin Jones guests on drums on three tracks. Brecker had never shied away from announcing his influences, and with Jones behind the traps, especially on the opening track, \"Arc of the Pendulum,\" and the closer, \"Outrance\" (both Brecker originals), he indulges his affection for John Coltrane, playing freely and aggressively across the rhythm. Jones, who gets a showcase solo in \"Outrance,\" is unmistakable, and his support often makes Brecker sound like Coltrane. With Bill Stewart behind the drums, the group performs \"Renaissance Man,\" a tribute to another major Brecker influence, Eddie Harris, and Brecker unabashedly recalls Harris there. The tunes, five by Brecker, two by Metheny, and one each by Goldings and producer George Whitty, are loosely structured and run from six to ten minutes each, so that the disc runs 70 minutes. Clearly, they could have gone longer: Several of them fade out, sometimes during a Brecker or Metheny solo, an oddity on a jazz album.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Brecker has updated these great songs with the addition of Pat Metheny's excellent production prowess on such great ballads as Joe Zawinul's \"Midnight Mood\" and the Kurt Weill-Ira Gershwin standard \"My Ship.\" \"Midnight Mood\" is sensual and seductive, complete with a blithe piano solo by Herbie Hancock in the middle section. Hancock fills in the beauty of Brecker's saxophone lines on this arrangement that is partially based on guitarist Wes Montgomery's version. James Taylor sings one of the best renditions of his \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,\" and it's clearly due to the excellent musicians on this CD. Pat Metheny excels as a serious jazz artist with his well thought out treatment of \"Nascente,\" which was inspired by Gil Evans' classic 1948 arrangement for Miles Davis on Miles Ahead.

		"review": "<p>This album was recorded live in Toronto during the 2001 Directions in Music tour that featured Herbie Hancock (piano), Michael Brecker (tenor sax) and Roy Hargrove (trumpet and flugelhorn), with Brian Blade (drums) and John Patitucci (bass) rounding out the quintet. The idea of the sold-out tour was to pay tribute to Miles Davis and John Coltrane, or, more specifically, to honor their creative spirit. If this recording is an indication of what went down at those dates, then the tour was certainly an artistic as well as commercial triumph. <i>Live at Massey Hall</i> consists of eight tracks, all of which merit close attention. For an extended listen to Brecker and Hargrove, however, you can't beat \"So What/Impressions,\" a Davis/Coltrane mélange. The song opens with Patitucci working a cool little one-minute bass solo, and then Hargrove and Brecker assay a joint thematic statement. Hargrove then steps off into a sparsely phrased solo (indeed a bit reminiscent of Miles), pushing the amplitude of his sound and piling up notes with amazing agility. Brecker answers Hargrove with a tenor sax solo that gets loose very quickly and holds a nervy edge for the duration, eventually achieving a stuttering angularity that returns the quintet to the melody line.</p><p>Brecker's seven-and-a-half minute, unaccompanied solo on \"Naima\" is sheer tenor sax virtuosity. The ensemble's powerful rendering of Coltrane's \"Transition,\" undertaken at a breakneck pace, is a blizzard of intensely swinging solos, and they do it again on the Brecker original \"D Trane.\" Hancock's comping wizardry, extra tasty on \"Misstery,\" is a constant, and when he takes his solo turns, his playing is masterful and full of very good ideas.</p><p><em>Live at Massey Hall</em> is a fine release for Verve and an album bound to make a powerful impression on jazz fans.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Philip Van Vleck -- CDNOW</strong></p><hr/><p><em>Directions in Music</em> marks Herbie Hancock's all-star tribute to Miles Davis and John Coltrane. It's clearly a chance for Hancock to return once again to his creative roots, when he was in Davis's great quintet of the mid-'60s, and he has excellent companions for the journey in Michael Brecker and Roy Hargrove, the tenor saxophonist and trumpeter who clearly demonstrate their inspiration in Coltrane and Miles. The CD begins with a reprise of Hancock's \"Sorcerer\" from his Miles period, with bassist John Patitucci and drummer Brian Blade, who were so crucial a part of Wayne Shorter's <em>Footprints Live</em>, and prove themselves just as important here. Blade is especially driving, pressing Hancock and the horns to complex creative dialogue. The synthesis of \"So What/Impressions,\" already closely linked tunes, benefits from the input of some fresh creative thinking, while Brecker's long cadenza on \"Naima\" is an effective invocation of Coltrane's intrepid virtuosity. Over 78 minutes in length, this is energetic, sometimes brilliant music, in many ways resembling Hancock's own classic, <em>Maiden Voyage</em>.</p> <p>&mdash;<strong>Stuart Broomer -- Amazon</strong></p>"

		"review": "<P>Given the heartbreaking context in which this album was released — this was the final recording by saxophonist Michael Brecker, who died of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia only a few months before its release — there might be a certain temptation to cut it some slack for sentimental reasons. However, leniency is hardly needed. Leading a group comprised of jaw-dropping talents (pianists Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau, guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette) and playing for the first time a program consisting entirely of original compositions, Brecker delivers an emotionally rich and startlingly powerful album of straight-ahead modern jazz that will stand as his musical epitaph and will effectively confound anyone who has ever been tempted to dismiss him as a mere jazz-pop fusioneer. It will also frustrate anyone looking for maudlin emotion or even any obvious product of existential angst; the only concession to sentiment here is on the title of a ballad, \"When Can I Kiss You Again?,\" a quote from Brecker's teenage son during a period in his treatment when his family was not allowed to touch him. But even that track, with its unusual chord progression and sometimes rather arid solos, retains a core of tough-mindedness within the tenderness. Most of the rest of the program consists of uptempo and medium-tempo burners that swing with a powerful sense of urgency and life, and precious little foreshadowing of the tragedy that all involved knew was soon to come. This is a brilliant and inspiring album — and would be whether or not it had anything to do with the death of one of the great figures in American jazz.</P><P>— <B>Rick Anderson</B></P><HR><P>Tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker lost his ongoing bout with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a rare bone marrow cancer, in January 2007. Pilgrimage provides one last chance to hear him in the company of like-minded souls. Joined by a who's who of mainstream jazz royalty, guitarist Pat Metheny, pianists Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau, bassist John Patitucci and drummer Jack DeJohnette accompany the saxophonist on this superlative session.</P><P>Brecker began his career as a session player in the early 1970s, something he continued to do throughout his career, to the chagrin of jazz purists. Having accompanied everyone from James Taylor and Joni Mitchell to McCoy Tyner and Charlie Haden, his ability to keep a foot in each camp made him an in-demand sideman. Combining John Coltrane's sheets of sound approach with funky soul, he established himself as one of the most distinctive voices of his generation.</P><P>His first album of all original tunes, Pilgrimage is also his most personal. Haunting ballads like “When Can I Kiss You Again?” and the churning “Five Months from Midnight” resonate with simmering emotion, but never subsume the session in mordant retroflection.</P><P>His illness does not appear to have hindered his playing abilities on this date at all. Sounding inspired and confident, his tone is strong and buoyant, his phrasing uplifting and intense, his fighting spirit apparent.</P><P>That spirit generates considerable heat, with the majority of the album propulsive and invigorating. Brisk post-bop (”The Mean Time”) and angular modernism (”Anagram”) alternate with simmering funk (”Tumbleweed”) and proto-fusion (”Pilgrimage”), often meeting halfway (”Cardinal Rule”). Delivering these tunes with elastic group interplay, the intuitive camaraderie shared between these artists is electrifying; rarely do musicians, even of this caliber, play to such heights.</P><P>DeJohnette is a marvel, his ceaselessly inventive patterns and thunderous palpitations are astonishing in their enthusiasm. His unbridled passion lifts the bandstand; this is one of his finest moments on record. Patiticci's bass resounds forcefully as Metheny unfurls billowy post-bop phrases with serpentine proficiency, even unleashing some processed distortion with his guitar synth. Splitting duties at the piano, Hancock and Mehldau provide a fascinating study in contrasts.</P><P>Michael Brecker's passing at age 57 is unfortunate. While some of his work over the years flirted with middling cross-over appeal, this uncompromising final statement is unquestionably from the heart. Pilgrimage is a stirring and celebratory jazz record, perhaps the finest of his career.</P><P>Track listing: The Mean Time; Five Months from Midnight; Anagram; Tumbleweed; When Can I Kiss You Again?; Cardinal Rule; Half Moon Lane; Loose Threads; Pilgrimage.</P><P>Personnel: Michael Brecker: tenor saxophone, EWI; Pat Metheny: guitars; Herbie Hancock: piano (1, 5, 6, 9); Brad Mehldau: piano (2, 3, 4, 6, 7); John Patitucci: bass; Jack DeJohnette: drums.</P><P>— <B>Troy Collins</B></P><HR><P>The importance of saxophonist Michael Brecker’s final recording, Pilgrimage, is densely multidimensional. The romantically inclined will attach significance to the fact that the nine compositions were conceived and recorded while Brecker was aware of the gravity of his final illness. Pilgrimage falls into an artistic/musical category that includes such disparate music as Mozart’s Requiem, Puccini’s Turandot, Billie Holiday’s Lady In Satin and Johnny Cash’s American Recordings, Volumes 5 &amp; 6. All of these examples were conceived during the artists' autumnal periods and, in these cases, represent something of pinnacles in their outputs.</P><P>High art in the face of destiny is not always the case, however. June Carter Cash’s final Wildwood Flower, while heartfelt, did the singer disfavor because she was obviously ill during the recording. Anita O’Day’s final recording, Indestructible, similarly sincere, was recorded much too far past the singer’s prime, and the aesthetic value of trumpeter Chet Baker’s final recordings remains up for debate. So, what of Michael Brecker’s final output?</P><P>In 2005, Brecker was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a diverse collection of hematologic disease all sharing in common the inappropriate production of blood cells and their propensities for transforming into acute myelogenous leukemia. Unable to find a suitable stem-cell donor, Brecker passed away on Saturday, January 13, 2007. While Brecker did remain active during the period of his illness, appearing on Beatle Jazz’s With A Little Help From Our Friends and Leni Stern’s Alu Maye (Have You Heard), he had been inactive a year before these recordings.</P><P>Thus, the artist’s largest late effort was reserved for Pilgrimage. He is joined by pianists Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau, guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist John Patitucci and drummer Jack DeJohnette, all sacred to Brecker’s generation of jazz musicians. The notable absence of Randy Brecker is acknowledged for the life-long collaboration he had with his brother in their various music endeavors. Save that, Brecker chose his group wisely as the results of the recording reveal.</P><P>Brecker’s tenor tone is strong and muscular. His composing is the best of his career. His melodic head-lines are organic, approximating a flock of small birds flying scattered one second and then in unison the next. Brecker and Metheny share a Bill Evans-Scott LaFaro empathy throughout the recording, both buoyed by the impressionistic piano of Hancock and Mehldau. The heart of the disc exists in its center with the pieces “Tumbleweed” and “When Can I Kiss You Again.” On the former, Brecker sets up a fast rolling theme and harmonics over which the soloists take quick flight including an aggressively distorted Metheny solo that gives way to one by Brecker. The rhythm section of Patitucci and DeJohnette creates a funky tonk with powerful momentum. No matter what, Brecker is in complete command.</P><P>“When Can I Kiss You Again” is Brecker’s introspective lullaby to his children, whom he could not see while in medical isolation. Again, his superior composing provides a carefully complex melodic introduction with a modal concept over which to solo. Composition and improvisation weave in and out of one another; constructing a silken fabric over which Metheny gives one his most inspired and introverted solos. Hancock provides his trademark abstraction as solo, depicting anxiousness as music. Brecker’s solo is middle to low register and impeccably structured (as are all of his solos). The disc’s title cut is a moody, Coltrane-esque meditation over electric piano with bass and drums occupying all sonic spaces. The piece grows in density and freedom as an open improvisation develops over the barest harmonic structure. And that was just the extended introduction. Brecker pulls all involved into an extended obbligato that is serpentine and seamless.</P><P>How does history view Michael Brecker? Many consider him to be the most important tenor saxophone player since John Coltrane. This is at the expense of Wayne Shorter, though Shorter generationally overlaps Coltrane. I would come closer to declaring John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter and Michael Brecker the apex of the tenor saxophone since Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster. That excludes a lot and that exclusion is necessary. Brecker’s importance lies in his universality. When I listen to Oliver Nelson’s The Blues And The Abstract Truth (Impulse, 1961), I think of that music as a jazz soundtrack of the 1960s. It had that sound that listeners would immediately identify as jazz: so with Pilgrimage and the opening of the 21st Century. Michael Brecker’s final recording is a finely crafted jazz soundtrack for a new millennium, serving in honor of the late saxophonist and all of jazz.</P><P>— <B>C. Michael Bailey.</B></P><HR><P>Michael Brecker’s tragic death in January 2007, at the age of fifty-seven, robbed the world of perhaps the most influential saxophonist to emerge since the equally untimely passing of John Coltrane. It’s easy to forget that he was one of the pop/rock world’s most called-upon studio players, recording on hundreds of albums with artists including James Taylor, Paul Simon and Eric Clapton. But it’s his prodigious body of work in the jazz realm that will be his most enduring legacy.</P><P>It’s easy to want Pilgrimage to be one of Brecker’s best recordings out of a purely emotional response to his passing. While the knowledge that this is his final recording creates an unassailable sense of loss, the fact remains that the writing on Pilgrimage stands as some of his best, and if he was in a weakened state you’d never know it. Brecker sounds as strong as he ever did—stronger, in fact.</P><P>For this last session Brecker called upon old friends—guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette and pianist Herbie Hancock (who plays on four tracks). He also collaborates, for the first time, with pianist Brad Mehldau on five tracks. That Hancock and Mehldau are vastly different players is an understatement; yet Pilgrimage remains cohesive and focused, with both players bringing their own inimitable strengths to the material.</P><P>Brecker’s unmistakable writing style stems, at times, from a post-Coltrane modality, but there’s a greater complexity and distinctive language. Solo space abounds, but Brecker’s ambitious writing is longer-form, with all manner of twists and turns that bring out some of the best performances on record from everyone involved. When DeJohnette takes one of his most energetic solos on the rhythmically and harmonically shifting “Anagram,” it’s over a metrically challenging piano/bass ostinato that ultimately turns contrapuntal when Metheny and Brecker reenter.</P><P>“Tumbleweed,” with Metheny’s signature synth tone, bears comparison to the guitarist’s own “Song for Bilbao” in that it’s an altered blues (also featuring a surprisingly funky solo from Mehldau), while the slinky groove of “Loose Threads” finds Hancock straddling the line between greater abstraction and more grounded soulfulness. Metheny seems to be inspired towards greater risks, with some of his most evocative playing in recent years.</P><P>Brecker takes the first solo on the opening salvo of “The Mean Time,” quickly dispensing with any notion that illness had compromised the visceral power that was a defining characteristic of his playing. “When Can I Kiss You Again?” may be a slow tempo tune with softer edges, but Brecker manages to mine surprising depths of emotion here as well.</P><P>They say that music has healing power. It may not have been able to prevent the inevitable with Brecker’s illness; but for brief time, a scant five months before his death, it’s clear that music gave him the strength to record a watershed album that represents a remarkable end to an equally extraordinary musical life.</P><P>— <B>John Kelman</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>One of the reasons that Jackson Browne's first album is among the most auspicious debuts in pop music history is that it doesn't sound like a debut. Although only 23, Browne had kicked around the music business for several years, writing and performing as a member of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and as Nico's backup guitarist, among other gigs, while many artists recorded his material. So, if this doesn't sound like someone's first batch of songs, it's not. Browne had developed an unusual use of language, studiedly casual yet full of striking imagery, and a post-apocalyptic viewpoint to go with it. He sang with a calm certainty over spare, discretely placed backup -- piano, acoustic guitar, bass, drums, congas, violin, harmony vocals -- that highlighted the songs and always seemed about to disappear. In song after song, Browne described the world as a desert in need of moisture, and this wet/dry dichotomy carried over into much of the imagery. In \"Doctor My Eyes,\" the album's most propulsive song and a Top Ten hit, he sang, \"Doctor, my eyes/Cannot see the sky/Is this the prize/For having learned how not to cry?\" If Browne's outlook was cautious, its expression was original. His conditional optimism seemed to reflect hard experience, and in the early '70s, the aftermath of the '60s, a lot of his listeners shared that perspective. Like any great artist, Browne articulated the tenor of his times. But the album has long since come to seem a timeless collection of reflective ballads touching on still-difficult subjects -- suicide (explicitly), depression and drug use (probably), spiritual uncertainty and desperate hope -- all in calm, reasoned tones, and all with an amazingly eloquent sense of language. Jackson Browne's greater triumph is that, having perfectly expressed its times, it transcended those times as well. (The album features a cover depicting Browne's face on a water bag -- an appropriate reference to its desert/water imagery -- containing the words \"saturate before using.\" Inevitably, many people began to refer to the self-titled album by that phrase, and when it was released on CD, it nearly became official -- both the disc and the spine of the jewel box read Saturate Before Using.)</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Having cherry-picked years of songwriting the first time around, he turned to some of his secondary older material, which was still better than most people's best and, ironically, more accessible -- notably such songs as \"These Days,\" which had been covered six times already, dating back to Nico's Chelsea Girl album in 1967, and \"Take It Easy,\" a co-composition with the Eagles' Glenn Frey that had been a Top 40 hit for the group in 1972. Browne unsuccessfully looked for another hit single with the up-tempo \"Red Neck Friend,\" reminisced about meeting his wife and starting a family in the coy \"Ready or Not,\" and, at the end, finally came up with a new song to rank with those on the first album in the philosophical title track, which reportedly was his more positive reply to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Wooden Ships.\" (David Crosby sang harmony.) Musically, the album was still restrained, but not as austere as Jackson Browne, as the singer had hooked up with multi-instrumentalist David Lindley, who would introduce interesting textures to his music on a variety of stringed instruments for the next several years. All of which is to say that For Everyman was a less consistent collection than Browne's debut album. But Browne's songwriting ability remained impressive.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Employing a real producer, Jon Landau, for the first time, Browne made what sounded like a real contemporary rock record, but this made his songs less effective; the ersatz Mexican arrangement of \"Linda Paloma\" and the bouncy second half of \"Daddy's Tune,\" with its horn charts and guitar solo, undercut the lyrics. The man who had delved so deeply into life's abyss on his earlier albums was in search of escape this time around, whether by crying (\"Here Come Those Tears Again\"), sleeping (\"Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate\"), or making peace with estranged love ones (\"The Only Child,\" \"Daddy's Tune\"). None of it worked, however, and when Browne came to the final track -- traditionally the place on his albums where he summed up his current philosophical stance -- he delivered \"The Pretender,\" a cynical, sarcastic treatise on moneygrubbing and the shallow life of the suburbs. Primarily inner-directed, the song's defeatist tone demands rejection, but it is also a quintessential statement of its time, the post-Watergate '70s; dire as that might be, you had to admire that kind of honesty, even as it made you wince.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Longtime fans welcomed the album as a return in style to the days of Late for the Sky, but a closer model might have been Hold Out, a complementary album concerned with the flowering of an affair rather than the withering of one, since Browne eschewed the greater philosophical implications of romance and, falling back on stock imagery (angels, rain), failed to achieve an originality of expression. Just as, in Hold Out, one wasn't so much inspired as informed that Browne had found love, on I'm Alive, one wasn't so much moved as told that he'd lost it. While it was good news that he wasn't tilting at windmills anymore, Browne did not make a full comeback with the album, despite a couple of well-constructed songs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

But after three decades, his songs of elusive love lost and found have become a little bit wry and world-weary. Witness the bittersweet title song, where the details are so crisp and well drawn that it's difficult to believe that he didn't just lift them from his own life. Similarly, \"The Night Inside Me\" returns to some of the wrenching themes of 1975's <i>Late for the Sky</i> with fresh anger. But it is Jackson Browne's turbulent romantic history--his elevation of the small, significant details that make up a life, or more poignantly, show one unraveling--that defines his work, and which is in full flower here.</p> <p><b>--Jaan Uhelszki</b></p>"

Guess he wants you to know he still matters to people -- and it's totally unnecessary. The music here speaks for itself. Whether or not one appreciates Browne's recorded catalog is immaterial; his gift as a songwriter is enigmatic, unassailable, and singular. There are 12 songs here from throughout Browne's career, ranging from \"These Days\" and \"For Everyman\" to \"Lives in the Balance\" and \"Looking East\" and all points in between. There are numerous spoken and instrumental intros to the material; Browne's a fine and comfortable communicator when it comes to sitting naked and alone in front of an audience, though sometimes his humor is cynical and borders on bitter. The versions of \"For a Dancer\" and \"The Pretender\" are deeply moving as are \"These Days\" and \"Too Many Angels.\" It would be easy to live without all the intros, as they merely point toward Browne and what he has accomplished, when the songs so easily speak for themselves and for him. Perhaps on volume two he'll let that happen. Despite his many asides, this is a fine and necessary addition to Browne's catalog. Still one has to wonder, with the double-disc Rhino set that appeared earlier in 2005 and these live retrospectives, when there will be new material coming from a songwriter who has had something to say that mattered in each of the last four decades.

While the song titles may be familiar to fans of both men, they don’t begin to tell the musical story on display here. Lindley and Browne were accompanied on all dates by the great flamenco percussionist, rock drummer, and producer Tino di Geraldo, and on select concerts by well-known Spanish musicians flutist Carlos Nunéz, vocalists Kiko Veneno and Luz Casal, banduria player Javier Mas, and others. Beautifully recorded, this set shows what Browne is capable of when he has musical foils who will not allow him to simply rest on his laurels. Lindley is, as expected, brilliant in shaping the textures and surfaces of these songs as well as highlighting the more subtle melodic touches in them, and Di Geraldo's rhythmic interactions push these two to play at their level best. The interplay between him and Lindley is near symbiotic, even on the most basic of tunes like “Mercury Blues” or \"For Taking the Trouble,” where the percussionist plays tablas to Lindley’s bouzouki. The Latinization of “El Rayo X,” with Browne on a baritone guitar and stellar harmony vocals by Lindley is a high point. Lindley plays fiddle on “Take It Easy,” and transforms it into something that envisions a Spanish bluegrass. “These Days,” with Casal’s heavily accented guest vocal, the fiddle, and di Geraldo's cajón, makes an already beautiful song exquisite. Lindley’s Hawaiian guitar transforms “Running on Empty” from its former place as a rock anthem to '70s-era alienation into a haunted warning filled with regret and loss. A full-band performance of the nine-minute closer “The Next You Voice You Hear,” featuring Veneno on duet vocals, also includes the cajón, tres player Raul Rodriguez, Hawaiian guitar, Charlie Cepeda on baritone guitar, and Nunéz's whistle. It becomes a dry, arid, funky blues that sends the whole package off on a soaring though lonesome note. This could have been an experiment that failed miserably, drenched in nostalgia and excess; instead, it succeeds grandly because of a sparse, tasteful approach with excellent arrangements and genuinely inspired performances.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

It was steeped in the gems from his rich catalog, presented with spoken word introductions to many of his best-known songs with a smattering of newer ones. The commentary got tiring in the CD format, but the music was impeccable and illustrated just how valuable he's been to American music as a songwriter. This second volume, while it does the same thing, is — in a manner — a mirror image of the first. The songs here are primarily from his later years. What's really interesting is that it doesn't matter. Browne's later songs communicate so directly that, presented in this manner, with only an acoustic guitar or a piano as accompaniment, we can find ourselves wandering around in reverie, or re-glimpsing the traces of emotion and time's passage as signposts to the way we live now. While there are a few \"classic\" tracks — \"Redneck Friend,\" \"Something Fine,\" and \"Somebody's Baby\" (from the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack) — most of the material here comes from records after Hold Out. There are three tunes from his last studio offering, the generally ignored and underrated Naked Ride Home, which stack up seamlessly with his '70s material. Those tunes, \"The Night Inside Me,\" \"Casino Nation,\" and \"My Stunning Mystery Companion,\" grace the beginning, middle, and end of this offering. In other words, no matter where else Browne goes (and he goes all the way back to \"Something Fine\"), he returns to the present tense, where he now exists as a songwriter. The performances of these tracks, and those from albums such as Looking East, I'm Alive, World in Motion, and Lives in the Balance, offer listeners an opportunity to hear Browne at his most elemental. His songs began this way, with a lone instrumental backing, as a melody dictating itself to words or vice versa, and were hammered out or came in the flush of white-heat creativity, but they were shorn of any adornment — just as they are here. The spoken introductions to several numbers are overly long and may have been fine for a sitting audience, but don't necessarily translate well to CD. That's a small complaint, however, as these 12 songs are quietly powerful, full of a particular craft and enigmatic gifts — no matter when they were written or recorded. Browne has never lost it as a songwriter; this is the proof. If you went to the trouble to purchase the first volume, this is an essential counterpart.</p><strong>&mdash; Thom Jurek</strong>"

		"review": "<p>Time the Conqueror is Jackson Browne's first studio offering in six years. The last was 2002's Naked Ride Home for Elektra. Browne established his sound in the '70s and has made precious few adjustments, with the exception of a couple of records in the '80s where the keyboards and drum machines of the period were woven into his heady, West Coast pop, singer/songwriter mix. Whereas his '90s albums I'm Alive and Looking East, as well as Naked Ride Home, mirrored the personal concerns of his '70s records in more elegiac terms, Time the Conqueror returns in some ways to Browne's more overtly political statements from the '80s such as Lives in the Balance and World in Motion and weighs them against the personal, but he's all but forgotten how to write hooks. The title track is as personal as it gets; its breezy, cut-time beat and airy melody signals motion like the white lines clicking by on a highway. They underscore both time and life passing away, juxtaposed against the need to appreciate each moment. Browne accepts the blindness of the future as he does the helplessness of the past, though he doesn't accept aging. The next couple of tracks underscore this. There's the elegy to the '60s in \"Off to Wonderland,\" a paean to the lost innocence of the heady years of idealism betrayed in both the Kennedys' and Martin Luther King's murders. The last line in this midtempo rock ballad is: \"Didn't we believe that love would carry on/Wouldn't we receive enough/If we could just believe in one another/As much as we believed in John.\" It was wonderland, all right; these ideals were not hollow but they had no basis in American reality. The hardest rocking cut is \"The Drums of War,\" which is Browne at his most didactic. It's as much a renewed call to arms as it is an indictment of the Bush years. It's a quickly passing moment, however, in that the very next track, \"The Arms of Night,\" is a spiritual paean urging the listener to seek love in the right places. It's tender, confused, and authentic, but dull. \"Where Were You?\" has more teeth with its stuttering attempt at 21st century funk. Musically it serves more as a rock track with actual rhythm than it does funk. It's another socio-political indictment of alleged apathy in the post-millennial age. This album goes on, with no real aim other than telling us things that Browne's been thinking about these days (with the exception of the Latin-tinged \"Goin' Down to Cuba,\" the best tune here; it's the only song with something resembling a hook). Browne seems to be speaking to his own generation; he's still trying to make sense of the world he wanted to live in and the one he actually does. Next time out, though, instead of worrying about his \"enlightened\" perspective, perhaps he should pay more attention to what made his earlier songs feel as if he actually owned one: craft. Most of these songs feel like quickly dashed off poems; it's all \"tell\" with no \"show,\" because there isn't anything in the music to effectively offer them to the listener as conversation; instead they are on display as mixed-message sermons.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>On Jackson Browne's first studio recording since 2008, the man who defined the '70s singer/songwriter generation finds a fresh way of dealing with the world as it is both personally and politically -- by going back to his own roots. Lyrically, Browne is inspired in a way he hasn't been since 1976's The Pretender, and this recording's production aesthetic adheres closer to that of even earlier records. His core accompanists are guitarists Greg Leisz and Val McCallum, with an all-star cast. Socio-political songs are plentiful, but these come from an intimate -- and therefore more appealing -- perspective; he often uses personal memory to frame his concerns. The opener is a (finally) finished version of \"The Birds of St. Marks,\" a song begun in 1967 and performed live intermittently but never recorded in a studio. Its sound harkens back to the the Byrds. Jangly guitars and an electric 12-string solo frame its introspective lyrics. \"Yeah Yeah\" borrows the changes from Lou Reed's \"Sweet Jane\" and pulls them off anew in a love song: \"And you paid for the love that we've got, you paid/And you made for the heart when we fought and you stayed…\" \"Leaving Winslow\" is a West Coast country song whose locale was namechecked in \"Take It Easy,\" yet this isn't an exercise in nostalgia but a solid, and sometimes humorous, paean to acceptance and the desire to disappear.</p> <p>Few writers could deliver a poignant song where surfing transitions to environmentalism and the historical consequences of empire. Browne can, and does -- with obvious melodic inspiration from Paul McCartney -- on \"If I Could Be Anywhere,\" where step by step, the political is equated with personal responsibility. There are two exceptional covers that introduce the record's latter half. Both are stellar love songs that are nonetheless topical, and both are by true song poets. The first is a stunning folk-rock arrangement of Woody Guthrie's \"You Know the Night,\" while \"Walls and Doors\" is a translation of Cuban songwriter/guitarist Carlos Varela's \"Las Paredes y Puertas,\" and features him and his trio. The latter is a lilting romantic ballad, arranged to underscore both the composer's and Browne's personas. Only \"Which Side Are You On\" sounds \"preachy,\" but that's because it is; it employs the same gospel-blues lyric scheme Bob Dylan did on \"You Gotta Serve Somebody\" but to secular ends. The title track, led by the songwriter and his piano, is a testament to the power of irrepressible hope and resilience: \"Though the world may tremble and our foundations crack/We will all assemble and we will build them back.\" Closer \"Here\" is one of Browne's classic broken love songs; its sadness echoes long after the album whispers to a close. Standing in the Breach is a back to the basics Browne album, and is all the better for it. He's no longer speaking at anyone, but conversing from the well of his own experience.</p><p>&mdash;<string>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>\"It's never been that hard to buy a gun/Now they'll sell a Glock 19 to just about anyone,\" muses Jackson Browne midway through \"The Long Way Around,\" balancing America's pursuit of freedom with the notion of consequence. Even in what the singer/songwriter can't embrace, he seeks compassion as piano chords fall like soft rain, ultimately offering, \"With all we disagree about/The passions burn, the heart goes out…\"</p><p>Browne has always led a double life: sensitive singer/songwriter and committed activist. During his 40-year career, there's been a tug of war between the romantic poet and the surging outcry. On Standing In The Breach, his first album since 2008's Time The Conqueror, the Southern California soft rock icon seamlessly reconciles the two.</p><p>Drawing on touchstones from his past, most notably The Pretender, Late for the Sky and For Everyman, he embraces his past without getting mired in the temple of who he used to be. His past is vibrant, but the shimmering melodies and tracks' spaciousness lends Breach immediacy.</p><p>Browne also reinvents Lou Reed—taking the changes of \"Sweet Jane\" and writing a forged-by-mingled-lives love song \"Yeah Yeah\"—and Bob Dylan—recasting the churning \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" in a more personal reckoning/invitation \"Which Side?\"—in far more hopeful terms. He even invokes \"Take It Easy,\" Browne's co-written ‘70s Eagles anthem, with the train-beat rootlessness of \"Leaving Winslow.\"</p><p>He understands the chambers and echoes of the heart. The haunted \"Here\" embodies the numb vertigo of a lover's absence, while the mythic \"The Birds of St Marks,\" begun in 1967 and played sporadically live but never recorded, weighs the costs and loss in love from a young man's eye.</p><p>That idealism permeates the twang of \"You Know The Night,\" a song of desire realized through the prism of awareness—drawn from 15 pages of Woody Guthrie's journals. The same ardor infused with seeking a higher world entwines Carlos Varela's \"Windows + Doors,\" Varela providing plangent echo vocals as the song finds a hushed climax.</p><p>Unlike Pete Seeger, Browne's activism never drowned the lover inside. For Breach, the two merge with an intoxicating sense; the personal elevates the political. \"Breach\" delicately offers optimism beneath its reckoning, while \"If I Could Be Anywhere\" tackles hard truth, love and the notion this is where he chooses to make his stand.</p><p>But it's \"The Long Way Around,\" where his misspent youth and our cultural mandates merge in a wake-up call as he name-checks Citizens United and the Gulf oil spill. Here acceptance isn't acquiescence, but the suggestion coming together is the only chance we have. For Browne, Breach is the best of all worlds.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Holly Gleason</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This nicely packaged two-CD box set presents legendary rock bassist/vocalist/composer Jack Bruce and his very reputable musical associates performing live in Cologne, Germany. Originally touted as a limited-edition double CD upon its release in 1993, the CMP label subsequently witnessed production/distribution problems, yet in 2001 it seemed as though the German fusion/rock record label might commence reissuing some CDs from its impressive back catalog. These two discs intimate an intriguing insight into Bruce's career, other than his well-known affiliation with '60s rock power trio Cream. Here, the artist renders a few soulful ballads, ventures into free jazz territory with saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith and ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker, and also utilizes a brass section for a sprightly R&B rendition of \"Born Under a Bad Sign.\" An added treat here is the teaming of British guitar hero Gary Moore with Bruce and Baker for a series of hard rock-blues pieces culled from the Cream songbook.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Glenn Astarita</b></p><h4>Tracks</h4><h3>1. Can You Follow </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce; vocals, piano</p><p>The concert starts with just Jack on his piano, and singing of course.</p><hr/><h3>2. Running Thro' Our Hands </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, piano</p><p>Gary Husband: keyboards</p><p>Still a beautiful song.</p><hr/><h3>3. Over The Cliff </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>These guys immediately got the atmosphere of that good jazz from \"Things we like\". Really great bass playing by Jack, with that rhytmic power of Ginger Baker backing him up. The quality of Dick Heckstall-Smith needs no further explanation.</p><hr/><h3>4. Statues </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith shows that he is still a great saxophone player.</p><hr/><h3>5. First Time I Met The Blues </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Dick-Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>Yes, here's the blues. You can sense that these four musicians really enjoy playing together. Some great guitar solos by Clem Clempson. But don't forget they're used to playing together (Clem and Dick in Colosseum and Jack and Ginger in the Cream, and of course Clem and Dick have played together with Jack on several recordings).</p><hr/><h3>6. Smiles And Grins </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals, piano </p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar ;</p><p>Dick-Heckstall-Smith: saxophone </p><p>Art Themen: saxophone ;</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ </p><p>Malcolm Bruce: synthesizer ;</p><p>Gary Husband: drums</p><p>This version is even better than the original one on the Harmony Row album. Partly because it is such a perfect song to perform live, and partly because of the addition of the saxophones. Besides that, Clem Clempson plays a different style of guitar playing than Chris Spedding. And last but not least, it's Bernie Worrell on the hammond organ!</p><hr/><h3>7. Bird Alone </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals </p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ, piano </p><p>Gary Husband: drums</p><p>Great up-tempo song, with these driving bass and guitar lines. Jack singing this one real fast. He can hardly keep up with himself. The second part of the song is much slower, but has still so much power.</p><hr/><h3>8. Neighbor, Neighbor </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: bass, vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Art Themen: saxophone</p><p>Henry Lowther: trumpet</p><p>John Mumford: trombone</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ </p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>As you can see on the line-up, this is a more jazzy song, with a blues feeling to it. I love that saxophone solo in the middle of the song. Lovely guitar solo by Clem Clempson.</p><hr/><h3>9.

These horns give this song that little extra that makes it different from other performances. Good guitar playing by Clem Clempson (I've always liked the Jack Bruce recordings on which he participates).</p><hr/><h3>10. Ships In The Night </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals</p><p>Maggie Reilly: vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: acoustic and electric guitar</p><p>Malcolm Bruce: acoustic guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>Gary Husband; piano</p><p>François Garny: bass</p><p>Simon Phillips; drums</p><p>As I stated on the \"Willpower\" review, this is a great song.

I love the contrast with the Gary Moore performances in this concert (Clem playing melodious, laid back and Gary playing more heavy).</p><hr/><h3>13. Golden Days </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, piano ;</p><p>Gary \"Mudbone\" Cooper: vocals</p><p>Clem Clempson: acoustic guitar</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>François Garny: bass ;</p><p>Simon Phillips; drums</p><p>Jack and \"Mudbone\" complementing each other perfectly.</p><hr/><h3>14. Life On Earth </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>From here the concert changes. Only guitar, bass and drums left, together of course with the vocals. I can be wrong, but I had the impression, looking at the concert, that Jack especially liked this part. Until this moment, the concert was good, but from here on it got more powerful, with plenty of room for improvising.</p><hr/><h3>15. NSU </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar, vocals</p><p>Ginger Baker; drums</p><p>Ginger Baker joined here. He still knows how to play the drums, and his playing, as always, forms a perfect basis for improvisation. Gary Moore proves an excellent choice for an alternative to Eric Clapton. He feels perfectly how these songs have to be played. great guitar solos combined with bass playing as in the Cream days. The improvisations are extremely good, considering the fact that this is the first time Moore and Bruce play together (except for the fact that Jack has sung one song on the Moore album \"Corridors of Power\".</p><hr/><h3>16. Sitting On Top Of The World </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Ginger Baker; drums</p><p>Another blues classic. I always liked this song on live Cream recordings, but I think this performance is even better.</p><hr/><h3>17. Politician </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Peter Brown: vocals</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>This song has been performed by Jack on several recordings, although this is the first time I hear Pete Brown, the writer of the lyrics, sing it. This performance of the song does not reach the quality / atmosphere as performed by West, Bruce &amp; Laing on their live album.</p><hr/><h3>18. Spoonful </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary Moore: guitar</p><p>Ginger Baker; drums</p><p>Another classic. Magnificent performance. It's played more \"staccato\" than Cream used to play it, but somehow this song needs that.</p><hr/><h3>19. Sunshine of your love </h3><h5>Line up:</h5><p>Jack Bruce: vocals, bass</p><p>Gary \"Mudbone\" Cooper</p><p>Clem Clempson: guitar</p><p>Malcolm Bruce; acoustic guitar</p><p>Dick Heckstall-Smith: saxophone</p><p>Art Themen: saxophone</p><p>Henry Lowther: trumpet</p><p>John Mumford: trombone</p><p>Bernie Worrell: hammond organ</p><p>Gary Husband: piano</p><p>Jonas Bruce: synthesizer</p><p>François Garny: bass</p><p>Ginger Baker: drums</p><p>Simon Phillips: drums</p><p>Pete Brown: percussion</p><p>The \"grand finale\" with this all time Cream classic.

		"review": "<p>The 16-tracks on this compilation are from Roy Buchanan's trio of mid-1970s titles: A Street Called Straight (1976), Loading Zone (1977), and You're Not Alone (1978). After a less than personally (or professionally) satisfying stint earlier in the decade with Polydor Records, Buchanan teamed up with Atlantic, who helped him get out of his pending contract with the former. Under the direction of Arif Mardin, the guitarist assembled the same instrumental support combo he'd used during his concurrent and practically incessant touring — John Harrison (bass), Malcolm Lukens (keyboards), and Byrd Foster (drums/vocals). The core quartet are augmented by all-stars Andy Newmark (drums), Will Lee (bass), Billy Cobham (percussion), the Brecker Brothers horn section, and even backing vocals from former Rascals member Eddie Brigati. The ferocious opening whine of \"Running Out\" is followed by Buchanan's nimble and liquefied tone, which enhances his otherwise bold and unabashed emotive leads. Specifically, the center solo exemplifies his remarkable ability to ably turn from a finely honed and sinister sound, to a divergent string stretching bluesy intonation. The reading of Jimi Hendrix' \"If Six Was Nine\" is nothing short of an inspired augmentation of the original. While Mardin's production on A Street Called Straight has been roundly criticized, there is a distinct progression from his previous studio releases, which were consistently hit-or-miss. Loading Zone is represented on this collection by no less than six of the LPs nine tunes. The effort was overseen by jazz bassist Stanley Clarke, and yields some thoroughly excellent material. Of top priority is the stretched-out Memphis groove on \"Green Onions,\" sporting contributions from Booker T. & the MG's personnel Steve Cropper (guitar) and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn (bass). Of equal note is \"Ramon's Blues,\" which commences this set, with riff upon riff of smouldering rounds of fretwork from Buchanan. You're Not Alone builds upon a spacey motif, right down to the astronaut headgear depicted in the cover artwork. Within the grooves are the languid and restrained \"Fly...Night Bird,\" as well as a pair of diverse cover versions of rock classics \"Turn to Stone\" (Joe Walsh) and \"Down by the River\" (Neil Young). After a blistering take-off, the former disintegrates, thanks to the rather uninspired smooth jazz arrangement, which is highlighted by Buchanan's intense fret board flurries. Vocalist Gary St. Clair fronts the soulful \"Down by the River,\" which is nowhere as essential as the live (and otherwise unavailable) rendering included on the two-disc Sweet Dreams: The Anthology (1992), or the decisive, if not definitive interpretation on Buck & the Snake Stretchers (1971). The ante is significantly raised, however, on the intense \"Supernova,\" which aptly reasserts Buchanan's proficiency. Although there is a bit of overlapping material, Guitar on Fire: The Atlantic Sessions (1993) is a great companion to the aforementioned Sweet Dreams: The Anthology as a worthwhile critical assessment of Roy Buchanan's sadly unrated status, reiterating his moniker as \"The World's Best Unknown Guitarist.\"</p> <p><b>&mdash; Lindsay Planer</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>Jeff Buckley resented being called a folk singer, but he made his name playing solo sets like this one on the New York coffee circuit. Sony released this live EP before his first fully produced rock album, Grace, perhaps to attract attention to the raw power of Buckley's greatest gift, his voice. These four songs certainly accomplished that end. Buckley hurdles seemingly unreachable octaves, suspends notes for what seems like minutes, and belts out his falsetto without a scintilla of restraint. That's a positive inasmuch as it allowed him to show off his considerable talent; it's a negative when it sounded like he was showing off. But his ten-minute cover of Van Morrison's \"The Way Young Lovers Do\" is a tour de force of strumming and scatting, and his acoustic \"Eternal Life\" has an electricity that is paradoxically lacking on the plugged-in album version.

It captures the magic of an entranced, adoring (and surprisingly large, considering how short a time <i>Grace</i> had been out) audience as they listen to the vocal acrobatizing and seductive voice of Jeff Buckley. Overall, the selections are very quiet and tender — just voice and guitar — but the loud tune (and only one with the band) comes first: a slightly stretched out incarnation of \"Dream Brother,\" and a particularly throat-ripping, emotionally tortured rendition at that. Next comes a galloping 12-minute clap-along version of Van Morrison's \"The Way Young Lovers Do.\" By the time Buckley switches over to French during his delivery of a medley of \"Je N'En Connais Pas la Fin \" and \"Hymne a L'Amour,\" the crowd erupts at the end of every phrase, catching him off guard with their enthusiasm. It gets to be a bit much, and the crowd almost manages to cut the song short with their enthusiastic approval, but the evident enjoyment of all present will be shared by fans. The last selection is a nearly 10-minute version of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\" During it, the crowd momentarily becomes the backing choir, softly chanting \"hallelujah\" while Buckley takes it quieter until the song eventually dwindles out.</p>&mdash; <b>Joslyn Layne</b>"

But there have been few whose brief career has been such a mystery as Jeff Buckley's -- certainly not in recent history. Maybe the recent release of Elliott Smith's posthumous From a Basement on the Hill will catapult him into the realm of the departed famous. But for now, it is the anti-hero Jeff Buckley who bears the full weight of having his career and its unrealized potential debated by the bored critic everywhere.</p><p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of his debut album Grace, Columbia Records released a three-disc set, including the original album, 12 outtakes, and a DVD that includes a documentary on the making of Grace and five videos.</p><p>The DVD is certainly interesting, and provides a nice look into the world that Andy Wallace and Jeff Buckley created at Bearsville Studios. Andy Wallace speaks about the recording process with more depth than most producers. It enables a closer look into Jeff Buckley's personality and provides some insight into the dynamic psyche that Buckley used to give birth to the now gigantic songs. Watching the Jeff Buckley interviews are interesting but at the same time disquieting. The entire documentary and all five videos seem permeated by the specter of Jeff Buckley.</p><p>It is not, however, the DVD that raises the most questions about Jeff Buckley's career, but rather the one new track on the disc of outtakes, the bluesy, soulful \"Forget Her.\" The song was ultimately scrapped at the last minute for the ethereal \"So Real\". That \"Forget Her\" has eluded release for as long as it has is surprising. It fully embodies, the feel of Grace, and would have sat nicely on the album. Jeff Buckley's voice and guitar is powerful and heartfelt. Listening to it (over and over) begs the question, \"Why did he decide not to release it as part of the album?\" In the stunningly packaged liner notes, Mary Guibert, offers the lucid explanation: \"It was for personal reasons that Jeff had removed it from the album.\" And herein lies the mystery that will always surround Jeff Buckley.</p><p>\"Forget Her\" casts more shadows on his career than has already surrounded it. While it sounds at home on Grace, it seems to fit just as well in the body of songs he had begun work for what may or may not have been Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. So, what was it going to be? Were we going to see a commercial follow up to Grace? Was it going to be the dark and gnarled guitar of \"Nightmares By the Sea\"? It is likely the only answer given (if one were given it all) would be, \"Jeff didn't discuss it for personal reasons.\" Often this comment can be interpreted to mean the artist is cracking up or battling with drugs. With the mercurial Jeff Buckley it means only that he wasn't telling because he was likely going to change his mind.</p><p>The shroud over his career is also a result of such a limited body of work. Jeff Buckley was not a prolific songwriter like many of his idols. Or, if he was, he wasn't telling anyone. It is unfortunate, not because fans jealously hang on every note he sings, but because the Legacy Edition is limited in its ability to truly capture his fragile genius.</p><p>Also contained here are stirring renditions of \"Lost Highway\" by Bob Dylan and Nina Simone's \"The Other Woman\". More impressive is the soulful track \"I Want Someone Badly\", which Buckley performs with the band, Shudder to Think. The cut finds him in '60s R&B territory, and his voice doesn't disappoint.</p><p>Some of the tracks contained on the Legacy Edition are culled from previous compilations and EPs; so many buyers will already have them. However, the intimate lost track \"Forget Her\" and the documentary are worth the purchase alone. Jeff Buckley brought a depth to his music and the world he lived in that is uncommon, to say the least. Colombia has sought to capture it, and does a reasonably good job, even if they fail to shed any new light on the enigma of Jeff Buckley's legacy.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>David Brecheisen</strong></p><hr /><p>Jeff Buckley's tragically early death surely did something to immortalize his one and only full-length album, but even so, Grace is without doubt a truly musical monument, spanning time and space and perpetually blowing fresh minds round the globe (and quite possibly somewhere beyond).</p><p>His voice is multi-textured and he uses notes to dramatic effect - the agony and the ecstasy of it hitting you straight in the gut. His music is so extraordinary, in fact, that it's impossible to put this album on in the background without being drawn into its psyche.  Don't just listen - experience, be mesmerized, take a trip.</p><p>This re-mastered Legacy edition of Grace includes a second CD of unreleased material and rarities, plus a DVD of promo videos and an expanded version of the original Grace documentary.  The question is, is it worth having over the original?</p><p>The answer is a definite yes, its main selling point being the fact that the second CD, dare I say it, is practically as good as the first.</p><p>It highlights his interest and accomplishment in diverse genres and consolidates his status as a musical pioneer.</p><p>Out of the 13 songs, highlights include \"Forget Her\", a stunningly beautiful song that sends the emotions tearing and tingling out the ends of your fingers. \"Kanga Roo\" is 14 minutes of abrasive, mind melting insanity, \"Parchman Farm Blues\" which hears Buckley capturing perfectly the meter and pitch of an old blues sound and the thrash rock-ness of \"Eternal Life\".</p><p>So, 10 years after the original release of this seminal album, the legacy edition is indeed a credit to his name.  There is poignancy to watching the man on film and you can't help wondering, as with all artists cut off in their prime, what may have been.</p><p>Listen and be purged.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephanie Barrow</strong></p><hr/><p>Jeff Buckley was a diva. And a particularly fanciful one at that. I remember reading about the late soprano Maria Callas and Buckley fave Edith Piaf, the fragility of their demeanors, and the notion they were more precious, tender than the world around them; that every moment within earshot of their voices was like hearing the song of the most rare and beautiful bird in the world. In fact, Piaf as the \"Little Sparrow\" was the most obvious blueprint for Buckley's flighty, unabashedly emotional expression; in both cases, whether your reaction was to adore or abhor the often raw (but never adolescent) bouts of melo- and other kinds of drama, no one could say they held their hearts in check. Consequently, they needed lots of maintenance. In Buckley's case, it was a steady stream of collaborators, girls, gigs and an impressive reserve of torch songs from way back when. He really wasn't built for the strand of rock music borne of rebellion or release; he was a songbird, like the kind that used to receive roses and blown kisses from the debutantes in the balcony after performances.</p><p>Unlike Callas and Piaf, Buckley grew up in an age when the chanteuse didn't need an orchestra or a symphony hall to get their message across. After having cut his musical teeth in Los Angeles, he came to New York in 1991 and soon hooked up with guitarist Gary Lucas, eventually joining his band Gods & Monsters. Lucas and Buckley established a partnership that produced some very good songs (including \"Mojo Pin\" and Grace's title track) in a very short time, but before they had a chance to make it out of the city, Buckley quit the band over a disagreement regarding his future loyalty. Afterwards, he played solo gigs, sometimes incorporating friend and bassist Mick Grondhal, and assisted by a growing legion of nighthawk fans, was soon signed by Columbia as a solo artist.</p><p>1993's Live at Sin-e EP gives the best idea of what Columbia's A&R; rep must have seen in Buckley at the time. At shows, he was the picture of a high diva: sprawling, boundless and with more than a pinch of self-conscious glitter. However, as he revealed in The Making of Grace, the behind-the-scenes feature that leads off the third disc DVD in Columbia's new \"Legacy\" edition reissue of his debut full-length, he needed a band. He already had Grondhal, met drummer Matt Johnson through Grace executive producer Steve Berkowitz, and, midway through recording the album, brought in guitarist Michael Tighe (who eventually contributed \"So Real\", to which Buckley added a chorus and put on the record in place of the bluesy \"Forget Her\"). Producer Andy Wallace speaks on the documentary about his concerns over how much of the record should reflect Buckley's solo performances, but true to form, the singer wanted it all.</p><p>Somehow, despite an overflow of ideas&mdash;they needed three different band setups available at all times to accommodate Buckley's various moods&mdash;the record got done. And it was released. And thousands of open-heart romantics heard their ship come in. As it happened, Grace was received with mixed feelings from critics who probably thought they were getting the next great alt-rock savior, and instead felt they'd received dinner theater for the moody crowd. They had a point: For all its swells of emotion and midnight dynamics, Grace was not a record to rally the post-grunge alternation. It made a jazz noise where a rock one was expected and a classical one where a pop one might have sold more records. MTV snagged \"Last Goodbye\", Grace's most radio-friendly song by a considerable margin, but Buckley was predestined for a cult stardom.</p><p>Grace's strengths have been well-documented over the years: The flawless choice of cover songs, including the definitive reading of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" (that we learn on the documentary was actually chosen based on John Cale's 1991 version from the Cohen tribute I'm Your Fan); the mystic, blue textures of \"Mojo Pin\", \"So Real\" and \"Dream Brother\" that seemed as related to Led Zeppelin as to Scott Walker as to Buckley's father; Wallace's sympathetic, intimate production and the band's equally sensitive following of Buckley's lead. And of course, he sang the hell out of those songs. His voice turned upward songs that naturally leaned inward; his reading of Nina Simone's \"Lilac Wine\" transformed from misty cocktail lament into transcendental experience, and the unlikely recasting of English composer Benjamin Britten's \"Corpus Christi Carol\" into ambient lullaby.</p><p>And, as this reissue proves, for every bit of lightning trapped in a jar, Buckley was willing to try his hand at many songs with which he held a weaker grasp. Firstly, he fancied himself a rock star, and the second disc of this set includes endearing, but ultimately inessential readings of the MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", a pretty silly Screamin' Jay Hawkins impersonation on Leiber & Stoller's \"Alligator Wine\", and a speed-metal take on \"Eternal Life\". His version of Big Star's \"Kanga-Roo\" nails its weary grandeur, but goes overboard on the ensuing 11-minute jam session, effectively transforming it from intimidating wall of drone into a meandering, albeit unfinished and tentative giant. He sounds best interpreting songs like Bukka White's \"Parchman Farm Blues\", Simone's \"The Other Woman\", and Bob Dylan's \"Mama, You Been On My Mind\", though his own take on the blues&mdash;the previously unreleased \"Forget Her\"&mdash;sounds comparatively pedestrian.</p><p>So, the question becomes how frustrated you are willing to be with Buckley. His posthumous releases suggest what Grace did: that he was one of the most talented musicians of his generation, while also being one of the most impulsive and, often, maddeningly inconsistent. Is he really being served by the uncovering of outtakes, B-sides and live performances? Fans certainly think so, but I won't cop to listening very beyond his lone completed record these days. And it bears emphasizing that its rewards have lost nothing in 10 years. Grace remains one of the most engaging, inspired records ever made, and its 10 original songs serve as the best possible portrait of Buckley as a diva, songwriter and artist.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Dominique Leone, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This is Carthy's purest and simplest folk effort, an all-acoustic recording done in barely an afternoon that includes his version of \"Scarborough Fair,\" awhich Paul Simon learned from Carthy (including the chords and changes from Carthy's arrangement) and transformed into a hit of his own. Also here is \"Two Magicians,\" a song that later entered the repertory Steeleye Span, and \"Lovely Joan,\" a folk song that is most familiar to classical listeners as the source of the counter-melody to Ralph Vaughan Williams' \"Fantasia on Greensleeves.\" The playing and the interpretations are somewhat less ambitious and rather rougher than subsequent efforts, with Dave Swarbrick guesting on fiddle on about half the tracks, and Carthy's guitar covering all but the acapella tracks.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

The differences lie in the careful nuances, and the sophistication of the paired voice and instruments, which are much more studied than anything previously heard. The music is glorious in its own unassuming way--Carthy's acapella performance on the haunting \"Brigg Fair\" (a Lincolnshire tune originally collected by Percy Grainger, and which was the basis for a classical piece by Frederick Delius), the interweaving of Carthy's voice and Swarbrick's violin on \"The Bloody Gardener,\" the dazzling title track, and maybe the best version of \"John Barleycorn\" ever recorded, are among 14 of the most prized songs in their careers.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

It's been only three years since Johnny Cash's death, and already we've seen a mythologizing Hollywood biopic, two versions of a sprawling four-disc box set, and a best-selling single-disc greatest-hits that tried in vain to squeeze a half-century career into 22 tracks. The Tupac'ing of the Man in Black stretches into the near future, with a fifth installment of his diminishing-returns American Recordings collaboration with Rick Rubin due in July. But for now, there's another posthumous chapter: the vault clearing.</p><p>Personal File, the first new material released since Cash's death, is two discs' worth of unreleased tracks, mostly acoustic, dating as far back as the early 1970s. The story, which sounds like a legend so is probably true, is that Cash recorded them in his home studio and locked them in his vault. They were recorded ostensibly for his own pleasure or at least for family posterity, not necessarily for public consumption. They sound like he's talking not to himself, but to an audience. All in all, the release feels like a scrapbook of sorts: half entertainment, half autobiography in song.</p><p>It's more than enough to dispel the aforementioned cynicism, which admittedly has more to do with marketing than music. Cash's commanding voice is in its prime, the setting is spare and intimate, and his song choice draws from hymns and hits to reveal a deep and complex inner life&mdash;of course, it's great. Occasionally it does seem a little heavy-handed, but that might have more to do with the sequencing than the songs. Plus, Cash is a fine storyteller, introducing these tracks with reminiscences that reveal their roles in his life. He introduces \"Drink to Me With Thine Eyes\" with a story about singing it for a high school graduation ceremony: \"I guess this was when I was looking for myself. But I never forget that because it's one of my first public singing occasions. And I've sung this song mainly to myself ever since I was 17 years old because of those memories.\"</p><p>His conversational, unpolished performances keep the mood loose and often add levity to the proceedings. On the Louvin Brothers' \"When I Stop Dreaming\" he can't quite sustain the notes that they held so effortlessly, but the attempt is endearing. Midway through the hymn \"Have Thine Own Way Lord\", his voice booming low and grave, Cash stumbles over the tune and has to start again. Poking a bit of fun at himself&mdash;how often has he sung this particular song?&mdash;he jokes, \"Okay. 'Have Thine Own Way', take five.\"</p><p>Listening to Personal File feels like reading an artist's journal or an author's correspondence. These 49 songs reveal depths about Cash, although at times they seem almost too personal, as if they actually were never intended for a public audience. The first disc contains secular material: love songs and tour songs and covers and country laments. The second disc is entirely spiritual, including two back-to-back songs about Mary Magdalene&mdash;\"If Jesus Ever Loved a Woman\" could be a Da Vinci Code tie-in. Given the solitary nature of the recording, this second disc sounds like a form of prayer and praise, as if the Man in Black is talking directly to the Man Upstairs. For Cash singing these songs became a form of worship, which makes this second disc undeniably moving.</p><p>Still, the decision to separate the secular and the spiritual on Personal File seems a little disingenuous and misrepresentative. There's already been a collection of discs that categorized Cash's songs under the headings Love, God, Murder, and the vague addendum Life. That set worked because the distinctions were the point of the compilation, revealing the breadth of Cash's interests and output. On Personal File, this same distinction seems a little suspect: Anyone with a passing knowledge of Cash's career should surely realize that he did not keep his spiritual side separate from his work. His hard-won Christian faith played a crucial role in all of his songs, lending them a moral gravity. Conversely, his secular concerns lend his songs of praise a powerful conflicted quality, making them sound like the humble prayers of a repentant sinner. On Personal File, this separation restricts these songs and their meanings and melodies: Why wouldn't \"Have a Drink of Water\", about Jesus in Samaria, fit right alongside Cash's take on John Prine's \"Paradise\"? Or \"The Engineer's Dying Child\" alongside \"My Children Walk in Truth\"? What would this tell us about such a complex American figure? I recommend you shuffle the tracklist and find out for yourself.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Between 1969 and 1971, Johnny Cash spent his Saturday nights hosting a variety show for ABC. \"The Johnny Cash Show\" was shuffled in as a summer replacement for another song-and-skit show, \"The Hollywood Palace\", and featured Cash and his touring company: His wife June Carter, various members of the Carter Family, Carl Perkins, the Tennessee Three, the Statler Brothers, and a series of rotating guest stars (beginning, rather auspiciously, with the camera-loving Bob Dylan). Each of its 58 episodes were shot before a live audience in Nashville's legendary Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry. It was the first network television show ever produced out of Nashville.</p><p>At the time, Cash was hitting his popular and personal apex: At Folsom Prison had enjoyed a remarkable 92-week run on the pop charts, a Grammy (Best Male Country Vocal) gleamed on his mantle, he was newly married, he was sober and devout. Johnny Cash was a rehabilitated outlaw, a Christian, a husband, a real, earnest American. And for home viewers in 1969, Cash was a welcome antidote to flag-draped coffins.</p><p>A 2xDVD best-of featuring 66 of the show's musical performances was released in September; the punctuated CD version features 16 songs, including nine that didn't make the cut for the DVDs. The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show is a remarkable collection, featuring live performances by Cash's country peers (Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Kris Kristofferson) and, perhaps more compellingly, tracks from folk, pop, and rock superstars (Ray Charles, Joni Mitchell, Roy Orbison, Derek and the Dominoes). The CD's production is impressively fluid, given the source material (8-track reels operating at half-capacity, recorded from scattershot stage mics), and was lovingly remixed and remastered after the tapes were pulled from Cash's personal vault.</p><p>Some of the best bits include the pre-song banter&mdash;before Waylon Jennings performs \"Brown-Eyed Handsome Man\", the former roommates rib each other gently: \"He was my cook,\" Jennings explains. \"Can you imagine Johnny Cash in a black suit with baking powder all the way down and gravy in the hair?\" \"I was a good cook,\" Cash retorts. \"You couldn't do nothing.\" Ray Charles' rich, sultry rendition of \"Ring of Fire\" is stunning, riddled with organ, piano, and brash horns; Charles' transforms the song from an obtuse acoustic tale into high drama. Joni Mitchell duets with Cash on \"Girl From the North Country\" (ironically, the same song Dylan performed for the show's opening night), while Cash and Lynn Anderson kick out a sprightly version of Geoff Mack's \"I've Been Everywhere\". Still, Cash's rendition of Carl Perkins' \"Daddy Sang Bass\" is the record's highlight. The track, which, occasionally dips into the Carter Family's legendary \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\", works as a parable for the entire two-season run of \"The Johnny Cash Show\", with Cash intoning: \"We'd get together in a family circle, singing loud/ Daddy sang bass, Momma sang tenor/ And me and little brother would join right in there/ Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul.\"</p><p>Although anyone who's checked out the DVDs will find themselves maniacally restructuring the track list (it's not hard to assume that the label wanted a hook to get fans to buy both documents, padding the CD with a handful of second-tier, if still outstanding, cuts), The Best of the Johnny Cash Show is still a tough testament to the grand fluidity of American music. Cash acted as a perfect conduit for cross-genre pollination, and the class, race, gender, and regional divisions that plagued America in the late 1960s are rendered perfectly irrelevant here.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M.

		"review": "<p>We're constantly bombarded by noise. Especially for those of us who live in     city, there's no escaping it; the noise of dense humanity has become a part     of our lives. We accept and ignore it just to survive. But sometimes the     noise becomes so overwhelming that the brain can no longer shut it out.     That's when we do one of two things: lose ourselves, or lose our geography.          Earlier in the day on which I wrote this, I woke up to a busy hammer just     ten inches from my head, flooding through the porous plaster wall. I swore     at someone whose face I'd never seen.  Then, the alarm clock joined in,     providing a grating beat that lasted all day, accompanied at times by the     horn blasts of sedate cabdrivers, the parade of victors and their drunk     fans, and the deafening screech of the old red 6 train. The noise got so     loud as to erase my memory of it having never existed.          Isn't it amazing, then, that I arrive home only to subject myself to more     noise: music that to virgin ears would sound like a drowning robot or a     greenhouse explosion? Yes, and understandable, too: the heightened stimulus     threshold must be met. But just as silence makes clearer the urban noise I     live through, so too does listening to Johnny Cash expose my mostly     stentorian music collection.          Like 1994's American Recordings and 1996's Unchained,     American III was produced by Rick Rubin and includes covers of     well-known and lesser-known songs. On the opening number, for instance,     Cash boils down Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" to its essence, employing     just two guitars and a barely audible organ. The only important instrument     here, though, is Cash's voice. As deep and heavy as a mudslide, it raises     the dead, the lonely, and the heartbroken.          What makes this not just a covers album is that, as Cash explains in the     record's liner notes, he makes the songs feel like his own. Sure, Petty     wrote it, but its hard to deny that, \"You can stand me up at the gates of     hell/ But I won't back down,\" is a quintessential Cash sentiment. They're     not his words, but they are. Call it a vocal strongarm. And he does     this again and again, from Neil Diamond's \"Solitary Man\" to Egbert Williams'     \"Nobody\", from David Allen Coe's \"Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of     Stone)\" to U2's \"One\".          But American III's high point is its two-song centerpiece. The first     is Will Oldham's \"I See a Darkness\", on which it becomes clear that, perhaps     because of his neurological disorder, Cash's voice isn't as sure and strong     as it once was.  When he quavers, with Oldham singing backup, \"Is there hope     that somehow you can save me from this darkness?\" the effect is absolutely     devastating. You won't listen to the song the same after this. The shivers     will eventually leave your spine, but the residue remains.          That song's transcendent power also stems from its production, which, although     still sparse, is relatively lush. The organ and piano that rise to match the     guitar remain in use for Nick Cave's \"The Mercy Seat\". Chronicling the     first-person thoughts of a man being executed, this song, more than any     other on the album, was written for Cash. Building to a rumbling crescendo,     he belts out, \"And the mercy seat is smokin'/ And I think my head is meltin'.\"     This would've brought even Gary Gilmore to tears.          The second half of the album features mostly original compositions. Sparse     like the early tracks, \"Field of Diamonds\", \"Before My Time\", \"Country Trash\",     and \"I'm Leavin' Now\" prove that Cash hasn't lost his songwriting step, and     they show why he can temporarily lay claim to other artist's songs. While     some critics take issue with Rubin's underproduction, none of the songs on     American III require ornate instrumentation. Whether they've been     fluffed up or stripped raw, at the core of each is a compelling statement     from one of our greatest humanists.          I keep telling people that I'm going to leave the city and move westward     to the country or the mountains. I've done it before, and did so with enough     success that I didn't concurrently sentimentalize the journey in an effort to     reduce cognitive dissonance. It may be in two months or twelve, but sooner or     later, I'll hit my breaking point, when I either lose the noise or it loses     me. The survival instinct requires that I move.  Guess who's going to be guide?</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Ryan Kearney, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The Man in Black's vision of the American west is one of a rugged, mournful land, where outlaws carry bibles     over their hearts, and where sometimes, the good book even stops a bullet.  The Man Comes Around is     poised as the next chapter in Cash's darkling fairy tale, the fourth in an ongoing series of mostly-covers     albums on which he gives material by some of today's most talented (or alternately, best-selling) artists     his own aged slant.          Now, time was, Johnny Cash covering a song like Soundgarden's \"Rusty Cage\" was a clever novelty made     impressive by his ability to infuse these modern-day rockers with overwhelming emotion.  Cash's renditions     of songs like Nick Cave's \"The Mercy Seat\" and Leonard Cohen's \"Bird on a Wire\" weren't so surprising, but     far more powerful, as the spirit of those songs was so close to his own.  The simple truth, of course, is     that Cash's talent is such that he can elevate nearly any song to which he turns his ear.  But on this, his     fourth go-round on the same theme, it hardly seems necessary anymore; the songs of this record are taken     from the most disparate ends of the musical spectrum, to no apparent end but show that he can do it.          The first tragic subject of this case study is, almost predictably, Trent Reznor.  (We knew it was just a     matter of time, didn't we?  I give it one more album before he gets around to Tool's \"Schism.\")  The     curriculum: \"Hurt\".  Now, I'm not a big advocator of the NIN sound, but I'll give \"Hurt\" that it's got a     fine melody, and its arrangement here is fantastic.  Cash treats the song with such sincerity and honesty     that it takes on a power that it never held in Reznor's hands, infusing it with genuine heart to accompany     the bitterness.  But that's just it-- could Cash really fail to bring something to this desolate ballad?     It's like taking target practice at the Empire State Building.  There's no challenge here-- it's just driving     home a point. (And incidentally, those of you anticipating the line, \"I wear this crown of shit,\" will be     sorely disappointed.)          Still, from the slithering blues groove of \"Personal Jesus\" to a surprisingly subtle duet with Fiona Apple     on \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\", Cash never falters.  Gorgeous, minimal arrangements highlight his emotive     baritone and distill each track to its finest essentials.  However, when an album consists of twelve covers     and only three originals, something more than pretty arrangements is necessary, and it's called cohesion.     Cash's renditions are often breathtaking in their simplicity, but rarely do they justify their presence     among a dozen other similarly afflicted songs.          A few exceptions are able to rise above, of course.  \"Hung My Head\" is, and always has been, more Johnny Cash's     than Sting's, and there's no disputing it now.  And Cash and his understudy Nick Cave do justice to fellow     Country hall-of-famer Hank Williams' \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\".  In these tracks, Cash finds something     more than excellent composition and heartfelt regret-- he taps into the essence of each song and truly makes     it his own.  If he could have done this more often, and with a better selection of songs, the bulk of this     record wouldn't be overshadowed by the cataclysmic magnitude of its original title track.          And the weaknesses of the covers wouldn't be half as apparent if they weren't thrown into such stark contrast     with an original that could stand proudly alongside \"Folsom Prison Blues\" or \"I Walk the Line\".  The Cash-penned     \"The Man Comes Around\" is an epic tale of apocalypse, interpreting Revelations with uplifting exuberance.     Restraint, resignation, and a hope of peace pervade the prophetic imagery.  Truly, the subdued fury and     beauty of this track reduces everything that follows.  The immediate question posed is: if this man can still     write and perform works of this caliber, why is he resorting to the words and music of others?  Ideally, the     covers should speak this answer for themselves.  Unfortunately, Cash fails to give them voice to do so, and     as such, they remain unfortunately silent.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Eric Carr, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This could be the first record Nick Cave has made that feels like he is just doing it because it is his job to make records and be Nick Cave. Everything is predictable and sounds like something Cave has done before. The Bad Seeds' edges are smoothed over by the too-slick production; Cave's lyrics are not provocative or funny or much of anything worth hearing. \"He Wants You\" is a smooth and tired-sounding love song, \"Still in Love\" is a gothic love song with cheesy lyrics and some sickly singing, and \"Wonderful Life\" has a nice, slinky beat and a memorable melody that is ruined by generic lyrics. There are also a few surprises of an unpleasant nature on Nocturama: \"Bring It On\" sounds like alternative rock by-the-numbers; without Cave's vocals it could be the Wallflowers.</p> <p>This could be the first Bad Seeds track to sport a depressingly standard guitar solo over the fade. Longtime Cave fans may need to reach for the smelling salts after hearing it. There are also a couple of songs that revisit the old storm-and-bang days of the Birthday Party and early Bad Seeds. One might say these forays into noisy, aggressive post-punk are commendable or one could say he is treading water he puked out 20 years ago. Add to that the fact that the racing tempos, jagged guitars, and shouted vocals of \"Dead Man in My Bed\" and the seemingly endless \"Babe, I'm on Fire\" break up the somnambulant mood of the rest of the record. Actually, while it may be derivative of his glorious past, \"Babe, I'm on Fire\" is a welcome blast of energy; he should have made it 30 minutes long instead of ten and called it his new record. Apart from that track, Cave sounds like a writer on his 15th book with nothing much left to say, nothing left to do but go through the motions, phoning his performance in with a yawn. His fans should send him a message by leaving Nocturama (his worst record title ever) to gather dust on record store and warehouse shelves. His laziness and weak effort should not be rewarded with your hard-earned cash.</p>&mdash; <b>Tim Sendra</b>"

Potently, he and Gladys Knight also remind us of the continued timeliness of Stevie Wonder's \"Heaven Help Us All.\" Its best moments make Company one more essential purchase for Ray Charles fans.</p>&mdash; Rickey Wright"

Maybe it was that the once reclusive Clapton was now spitting out new albums every six months, but E.C. Was Here did not achieve the renown it deserved upon release, and Clapton, who had been reluctant to put out a straight blues album to begin with, didn't try anything similar again for almost 20 years, instead making sure to keep his records within a pop framework that usually diluted their effectiveness. In its CD reissue, with \"Drifting Blues\" extended out to its full 11 1 / 2 minutes, the album is even more impressive. </p><br><br>- - William Ruhlmann<br>"

The difference is substantial - - where No Reason to Cry struggled hard to find the right tone, Slowhand opens with the relaxed, bluesy shuffle of J.J. Cale's \"Cocaine\" and sustains it throughout the course of the album.</p><p>Alternating between straight blues (\"Mean Old Frisco\"), country (\"Lay Down Sally\"), mainstream rock (\"Cocaine,\" \"The Core\") and pop (\"Wonderful Tonight\"), Slowhand doesn't sound schizophrenic because of the band's grasp of the material. This is laidback virtuosity - - although Clapton and his band are never flashy, their playing is masterful and assured. That assurance and the album's eclectic material makes Slowhand rank with 461 Ocean Boulevard as Eric Clapton's best album.</p><br><br>- - Stephen Thomas Erlewine<br>"

If it wasn't quite the masterpiece, or the sales monster, that Slowhand had been, this probably was because of that usual Clapton problem - - material. Once again, he returned to those Oklahoma hills for another song from J.J. Cale, but \"I'll Make Love to You Anytime\" wasn't quite up to \"Cocaine\" or \"After Midnight.\"</p><p> Bob Dylan contributed two songs, but you could see why he hadn't saved them for his own album, and Clapton's own writing contributions were mediocre. Clapton did earn a Top Ten hit with Richard Feldman and Roger Linn's understated pop shuffle \"Promises,\" but it was not one of his more memorable recordings. Of course, Clapton's blues playing on the lone obligatory blues cut, \"Early in the Morning\" (presented in its full eight - minute version on the CD reissue), was stellar.

Spanning four discs and consisting almost entirely of live material (there are a handful of studio outtakes), this is music that will only enthrall completists and archivists. For those listeners, there is a wealth of fascinating, compelling performances here, as well as a fair share of mediocre, uninspired tracks.</p><p>The key word for the entire album is detail - - it is an album for studying the intricacies of Clapton's playing and how it evolved. For example, it's easy to hear the differences and progressions between the four versions of Robert Johnson's \"Rambling On My Mind.\" And it is Clapton that evolves, not his supporting band - - although they are proficient, they are hardly exciting. However, they're static, professional support provides a nice bed to chart Slowhand's growth over the course of the decade, simply because he is always the focal point. Crossroads 2 may only be for a collector, but for those collectors, it is a treasure, even if some of the tracks are fool's gold.</p><br><br>- - Stephen Thomas Erlewine<br>"

Finally, it turned out to be the final record of his 15 - year association with Polydor, which therefore had no reason to promote it.

Best of all, Clapton had taken the time to write some songs - - he's credited on six of the nine selections - - and tunes such as the title track and \"I Can't Stand It\" held up well.

Furthermore, the songwriting is consistently strong, alternating between fine mainstream rock originals (\"Pretending\") and covers (\"Before You Accuse Me,\" \"Hound Dog\").

When he sings, Clapton loses that sense of originality, choosing to mimic the vocals of the original recordings. At times, his overemotive singing is painful; he doesn't have the strength to pull off Howlin' Wolf's growl or the confidence to replicate Muddy Waters' assured phrasing. Yet, whenever he plays, it's easier to forget his vocal shortcomings.

Opening up with an acoustic rendition of \"Layla,\" the performance starts off on a subtle note before plunging into the higher-wattage straits of \"Badge\" and other songs — working alongside Clapton are Dave Bronze on bass, Andy Fairweather-Low on guitar, Chris Stainton on keyboards, Steve Gadd on drums, Jerry Portnoy on harmonica, Roddy Lorimer, Simon Clarke, and Tim Sanders on horns, plus a girl vocal duo and a gospel choir singing backup. Interestingly, in addition to the expected numbers associated directly with Clapton and his idols — including \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" \"Five Long Years,\" and \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\" — he also performs \"White Room,\" a number written by and much more closely associated with (and, indeed, still in the repertory of) Jack Bruce. The latter is transformed into something much more lyrical and upbeat than the Cream original. The sound, which offers a selection of stereo, DTS, and 5.1 Surround, is impeccable, and the full-screen (1.33-to-1) image is even better, with lively, mobile camera work, and coupled with the fact that the 89-minute program captured Clapton on what looks like an especially \"on\" gig, this is a purchase that any fan, dedicated or casual, can make with confidence. The disc opens automatically on an easy-to-use menu with the \"play\" option in the default position.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b></p>"

The DVD features 19 acoustic and electric performances recorded in rehearsal spaces in Dallas and in England, as well as in the 508 Park Ave. in Dallas, a studio Johnson himself recorded in, in 1937. There is one more segment, a recorded solo acoustic in a hotel room in California. The band that joins Clapton in the rehearsal studios is comprised of guitar master Doyle Bramhall, organist Billy Preston, Steve Gadd on drums, pianist Chris Stainton and Nathan East on bass. The electric performances, particularly \"Milkcow's Calf 's Blues,\" \"Stop Breakin' Down Blues,\" and especially \"I Wish I Had Possession Over Judgment Day,\" have some real life and stomp in them. Of the acoustic tracks, \"Terraplane Blues\" works best. The DVD also contains a selection of behind-the-scenes footage that will be of interest only to those fans who need to see everything. The CD contains 11 cuts culled from the DVD and the sequencing is in some ways preferable.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Until the concerts, which took place at New York City’s historic venue from February 25th to the 28th of 2008, the two rocks legends and longtime friends had yet to perform a full concert together for nearly 40 years. Clapton and Winwood had first worked together in the 1966 blink-and-you-missed it supergroup Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. The two would join forces yet again for another supergroup in 1969, the acclaimed Blind Faith. Unfortunately, due to a number of issues, the group dissolved within a year of its creation and Blind Faith’s final performance took place in Hawaii on August 24th of 1969. The idea for a reunion concert would arise from the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival where Clapton and Winwood took the stage together to perform a small number of songs.</p><p>Live from Madison Square Garden compiled the cream of the performances taken from those the concerts to showcase this historic reunion of rock and roll royalty. With the help of Chris Stainton on keyboards, Ian Thomas on drums, and Willie Weeks on bass, Winwood and Clapton beautifully performed songs from each other’s lengthy musical careers in addition to a number of classic blues and rock covers. As expected, a healthy dose of Blind Faith’s one and only album graced both the stage and recorded releases, with “Had To Cry Today”, “Presence of the Lord”, and “Can’t Find My Way Home” shinning the brightest. A number of songs from Winwood’s breakthrough group, Traffic, such as “Dear Mr. Fantasy”, “Glad”, and “Pearly Queen”, made appearances. Clapton brought with him his chart-topping “Forever Man” as well as his beloved renditions of J.J. Cales’ “After Midnight” and “Cocaine”. The music of Jimi Hendrix was also celebrated as “Little Wing”, the Band of Gypsys piece “Them Changes”, and, the quintessential example of psychedelic blues, “Voodoo Chile” were all brilliantly brought to life. Months before the live album was even released, Clapton and Winwood announced a 14 date tour of the United States that would kick off on June 10th, 2009, and would follow that tour with others in the following years. Live from Madison Square Garden went on to be quite the success and is truly a treat for a fan of either Clapton or Winwood. Hands down, it should not be missed!</p>"

		"review": "<p>More than any other genre, jazz seems best suited for the live environment. An artist can improvise in the studio, certainly, but in concert a musician can ignore time limits and stretch creative possibilities. This is especially true of all-star collaborations; they can seem contrived or forced, but when chemistry exists between the players, the result is jazz in its purest, most exciting form. Such is the case on this disc, which features five contemporary giants: Clarke, Larry Carlton, Najee, Deron Johnson, and Billy Cobham. Seventy minutes for seven songs allows the players to interact and solo at length, stretching originals and Miles and Mingus covers to their limit. While each member is a monster improvisor, all base their musings on a definite wave of melodic brilliance. Najee is the real surprise here, as Clarke says in his liner notes. While the others are respected as top fusion cats, the saxman has always faced criticism for the commercialism of his albums; here, Najee proves he can blow with the best of them, getting the energy flowing on tracks like his own \"Buenos Aires.\" Other highlights include the light intro \"Minute By Minute,\" which L.C. popularized as an instrumental; Cobham's explosive \"Stratus\"; Carlton's simmering \"Her Favorite Song\"; and the final piece, an increasingly frenetic, 22-minute explosion of Clarke's classic \"School Days.\"</p>&mdash; <b>Jonathan Widran</b>"

The opening number, \"Going to the Country,\" still evokes that hippie-esque, back-to-the-earth movement as well as any song ever recorded, complete with a sly wink that keeps it fresh to this day. And since this was 1970, the album also comes equipped with some of those quaint excesses of the period; try the nasal tone poem gracing \"The Bicycle Trip.\" \"Musical Friends\" remains a lively, happy-go-lucky classic with piano signature lifted from Paul McCartney's playbook; it's difficult to picture the dour Cockburn of more recent years ever having this much fun. In contrast, \"Thoughts on a Rainy Afternoon\" offers a trance-like, introspective atmosphere reminiscent of British folkie legend Nick Drake.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Roch Parisien</strong></p>"

There's the ragtime blues of \"Happy Good Morning Blues,\" the ambitious minor-key troubadour folk of \"Love Song,\" and the slide guitar country of \"One Day I Walk\" to kick things off. And over the album's original ten songs it just becomes more ambitious. \"Golden Serpent Blues,\" with its poignant and percussive piano lines, is something out of a Western Canadian barrelhouse where the piano player has heard and loved \"Lady Madonna.\" Overall, however, this album -- like Sunwheel Dance that follows it -- presents a far more mystical Cockburn. His tenderness and poetic vision are almost pastoral on these early recordings, something that would get burned off and become hard-bitten (if no less romantic and more dramatic) as his music and social vision grew</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Recorded live in Toronto, the record brings together some of Cockburn's best songs from this period, including the beautiful meditation \"All the Diamonds in the World,\" the bluesy \"Mama Just Wants to Barrelhouse All Night Long,\" and \"Lord of the Starfields\" from his previous release. And while there isn't anything drastically different here, many of the tracks are more assured and fully realized than their studio counterparts, with Cockburn's guitar and voice front and center -- solo or backed by subtle bass, percussion, and piano or marimba. There are also a scattering of new tunes that mix nicely with the older material, with the Native American tribute \"Red Brother, Red Sister\" and the instrumental \"Deer Dancing Round a Broken Mirror\" the true standouts. Strong performances and a good selection of songs help Circles in the Stream succeed not only as a good live album, but also as a decent retrospective of Cockburn's first seven years.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

This Rounder reissue is fully remastered and contains one bonus track, a live reading of the album's opener, \"Grim Travellers.\" Cockburn's marriage had fallen apart, he'd moved from the country to a gritty inner-city section of Toronto called Cabbagetown, and he'd begun to explore in earnest the reggae rhythms that had underscored his hit single \"Wondering Where the Lions Are\" from Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws. The record of a restless travelogue that has become his stock in trade as a wandering observer, activist, and minstrel with deep wanderlust, Humans is the result of great turmoil and pain, and reveals Cockburn's musical, spiritual, and emotional worldview as all in flux. The record opens with the hard truth of global mercenaries in \"Grim Travellers,\" a shimmering beauty of a song with a dubby bassline and jazzed-out Fender Rhodes piano. This is Cockburn's first issued song in his documentary style, complete with rich metaphorical images of horror and truth and the beauty on their nether sides. \"Rumours of Glory\" is straight-up reggae. It grooves and rocks steady, with a bubbling bassline punching up the front line. Lyrically the song offers a new kind of mystical attraction for Cockburn, one rooted in the crust of everyday life: \"You see the extremes of what humans can be/In that distance/Some tensions are born/Energy surging, like a storm/You plunge your hand in/You draw it back, scorched/Beneath, it's shining like gold/But better....\" A beautiful backing chorus that sounds like the I-Threes croons the tune to a close.</p><p>There is real darkness and anguish here, too. On \"You Get Bigger as You Go,\" a relationship separates as the world comes apart in front of the protagonist's eyes as he looks out the window; acoustic guitars, violins, and tom-toms usher in the tough truth of a new day. The album's best travel song, \"How I Spent My Fall Vacation,\" talks about the tensions of traveling in a beautiful but dangerous world; it's followed by \"Tokyo,\" a darkly ironic account of a terrible accident witnessed by the protagonist while visiting. The album closes with a low-key manifesto in \"The Rose Above the Sky.\" It's an affirmation of faith in the darkness, of waiting for God in the heart of loss and uncertainty. Graced by acoustic guitars fingerpicked softly and painted by keyboard washes, it grows in tension and texture, becoming an anthem by its end. Humans is universal in its confusion and hard-won willingness to endure without seeking creature comforts or easy answers. Its musical and lyrical adventure would be a watermark for any artist; for Cockburn it became the first step to musical and poetic freedom. It sounds as harrowing, beautiful, and ethereal 20-plus years later as it did when it was first issued, and offers a uniquely universal message for seekers of personal, social, and spiritual truth. This is the one to start with. It is also the one to end with.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Furthermore, like that record, there's an uneasiness that runs throughout, from the jazz-tinged opener, \"You Pay Your Money and You Take Your Chance,\" to the disquieting \"Loner,\" which closes the album. Even a love song like \"Wanna Go Walking,\" one of the most straightforward rockers he's ever recorded, reflects the weight of the outside world. Only the jazzy instrumental \"Radio Shoes\" and the joyful \"And We Dance\" remain free of this underlying tension. Musically, moody synths, violin, and woodwinds on Inner City Front underscore the dark, reflective nature of the material, which like its predecessor, deals with the \"paradox and contrast\" in the human condition, from personal relationships to world affairs. Also, for the second consecutive recording, Cockburn eschews the folkier, acoustic leanings of his '70s work and places both feet squarely into the jazz and worldbeat rock that dominated the majority of Humans. One track, \"The Strong One,\" is even given a slow, brooding, techno treatment. Since the release of In the Falling Dark, Cockburn was gaining creative momentum with each release, and Inner City Front continues that trend.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

And while he had touched on similar musical themes on earlier recordings, the eclectic blend of folk, rock, and world music here is much more defined and realized. The use of synths, electric guitar, violin, and Chapman Stick, along with the occasional keyboard and drum sequences, complement the weighty, ominous nature of his lyrical concerns, which seem to paint a picture of a world, though teetering on the edge, still filled with beauty (\"Hoop Dancer\"), hope (\"Put Our Hearts Together\"), and contentment (\"Waiting for the Moon to Show\"). Amidst the \"chaos\" and \"fashionable fascism,\" Cockburn's message, though cloaked in frustration and cynicism, and not nearly as overt as it has been in the past, is still one of faith and love. There is the tendency to get heavy-handed at times, but still, The Trouble With Normal contains some of Cockburn's most beautifully imagistic writing to date and is another strong effort. The U.S. release contains an alternate, yet inferior take of the title track, which makes the Canadian (True North) version preferable.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>After visiting Central America, Bruce Cockburn recorded Stealing Fire, part of which passionately and eloquently details what he'd seen while in Nicaragua and Guatemala. With the opening track, the terse rocker \"Lovers in a Dangerous Time,\" Cockburn conveys both a sense of urgency and uncertainty. There's a brief calm as the second half begins, before a triad of songs written about his time spent in Central America brings the record to a sober conclusion. These three tunes, which, like the majority of the album, sport a tight, worldbeat, folk and rock flavor, are the true highlights of Stealing Fire, and Cockburn at his very best. The first, \"Nicaragua,\" is part observation, part commentary, and part tribute to the Sandinista-led revolution in that country. \"If I Had a Rocket Launcher\" follows, and is arguably Cockburn's most powerful merging of personal and political feelings. Written after witnessing Guatemalan refugees being chased across the border by gun-wielding helicopters, \"Rocket Launcher\" evokes not only the pain and suffering of the people, but the conflict between Cockburn's pacifist leanings, and the vengeful anger and hatred incited by such a horrific sight. The Nicaraguan, road-inspired \"Dust and Diesel\" closes the record with a portrait of a country whose daily contrast of beauty and violence is summed up by the images of people who are proud, hopeful, passionate, afraid, and tired. Stealing Fire, despite a few less than compelling tracks, is the work of an artist at his peak. It also contains some of the most intensely significant material by a singer/songwriter in the 1980s.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

It was a move away from the somewhat dated, overblown sound of his previous World of Wonders, toward a leaner, more guitar-dominated sound. Budgeting for album art seemed to be a little low, but luckily the collection of songs was of consistent high quality. As with most Cockburn albums, this is a mix of socially conscious, spiritual, and reflective songs. Cockburn had spent time in Nepal in 1987 and what he saw there found its way into some songs, including \"Tibetan Side of Town\" and \"Understanding Nothing.\" Time spent in Germany soon after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union inspired \"Radium Rain,\" while deforestation of the globe inspired \"If a Tree Falls,\" the first single from the album. Cockburn is equally at home writing about matters of the heart, though his lyrics take a much more unconventional turn in \"Don't Feel Your Touch,\" with lines such as \"the night grows sharp and hollow as a junkie's craving vein\" and \"the night grows clear and empty as a lake of acid rain.\" Elsewhere on the album, in \"Gospel of Bondage\" he takes pains to differentiate himself from right-wing Christianity and express his different view of the faith. Unusually for Cockburn, he ends the album on a slightly humorous (albeit dark humor) note with \"Anything Can Happen,\" a look at the temporariness of life, where \"anything can happen\" at any time \"to put out the light.\"</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rob Caldwell</strong></p>"

Fronting a tight three-piece unit, which sounds bigger thanks to Fergus Marsh's stick, Michael Sloski's eloquent drumming, and his own fingerstyle guitar work, Cockburn delivers a nice overview of his career, dating back as far as the record's opener, \"Silver Wheels,\" from 1976. Amid his usual elements of spirituality and state-of-the-world messages, there's also a lightness and even a sense of humor that is rarely, if ever, seen in his studio work. His choice to close with \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" from the crucifixion scene in Monty Python's Life of Brian is both funny and inspired, while \"Rumours of Glory,\" with its playful harmonica, gains a joyful bounce, and his lone Top 40 U.S. hit, \"Wondering Where the Lions Are,\" becomes a crowd-pleasing singalong. Elsewhere Cockburn gives a new look to old tunes, whether it's solo performances of \"After the Rain\" and \"Call It Democracy,\" the stark power of the bodhran, vocal rendition of \"Stolen Land,\" or the more palatable, jumping blues treatment of \"Maybe the Poet.\" Even though there are no songs, with the exception of \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,\" that are not available elsewhere, there's enough personality in these live versions to recommend the record on its own merit, and not just as a souvenir of a successful tour.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

Throughout, Burnett's production is understated, allowing Cockburn's voice, guitar, and songs to lead the way over a solid foundation of bass, drums, and tasteful organ by Booker T. Jones. This sort of sympathetic production brings out the best in Cockburn and his material, which is consistently strong. Songs such as \"Kit Carson,\" \"Mighty Trucks of Midnight,\" and \"Indian Wars\" continue the weightier concerns of his work of the past decade, but the majority of the record takes on a more personal, introspective tone. \"One of the Best Ones\" and \"Great Big Love\" are winning affirmations of love and life, while the retelling of the nativity, \"Cry of a Tiny Babe,\" is as beautiful and moving a contemporary Christmas song as you're likely to hear. Cockburn also decides to include a rare cover, his excellent reading of the Blind Willie Johnson gospel-blues \"Soul of a Man,\" which fits nicely in the whole of the album. Though it may lack the immediate power, Nothing but a Burning Light is Bruce Cockburn's best since his 1984 release Stealing Fire.

The opening track, \"Listen for the Laugh,\" a horn-driven rocker that wouldn't have been out of place on many of his recordings during the '80s, and the almost joyful finality of \"Tie Me at the Crossroads,\" bookend what is primarily more subdued material, including the tender second track, \"All the Ways I Want You,\" which more suitably sets the tone for the album. And though it may not possess the intensity or power of his early-'80s output, Dart to the Heart comes with nearly a quarter century of experience behind it, bringing an insight, depth, and maturity to Cockburn's ventures into love and the mystic. Still, there's just enough outrage and frustration to keep things interesting. Musically, T-Bone Burnett's sympathetic production tastefully and engagingly frames the songs, placing Cockburn's vocal and characteristically superb guitar at center stage. Those who may have found his overtly political, worldbeat and jazz-inflected rock a bit strident in the past should find his approach here more inviting. And while he may have revisited this familiar ground from time to time throughout his career, Dart to the Heart is a convincing reminder of a gentler, more reflective Bruce Cockburn.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

Shades of light and shadow play through the album's theme of reflection and memory: Cockburn recalls many events of his past, taking stock and coming to grips with them. It's a very cohesive album in subject, with only the anti-land mine \"Mines of Mozambique\" seeming out of place (though it's a worthwhile song on its own). The centerpiece of the album is the title song, a realization that facing the past can be more difficult when memories are exposed in the cold hard light of day, but the refuge and peace darkness can provide is \"the charity of night.\" In fact, most of the album's events happen at night and this theme is echoed in the haunting booklet artwork by Bill Sienkiewicz, graphic novel illustrator for comics such as The Sandman. Musically the sound is very organic, with solid bass and drums provided by Rob Wasserman and Gary Craig. Guest Gary Burton provides shimmering vibraphone on three of the cuts, adding to the jazz texture. Other guests include Bonnie Raitt, Ani DiFranco, Jonatha Brooke, and Patty Larkin. The album culminates with \"Strange Waters,\" a summation of Cockburn's life-long spiritual search, where he asks the question \"if I loose my grip, will I take flight?\" Acclaimed by fans and critics alike, this album is an essential part of the Cockburn catalog.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rob Caldwell</strong></p>"

Lyrically, Cockburn doesn't stray from the impressionist poetic lyrics that he's honed over the years, nor does he stray from his favored topics: travelogs, including those drawn from his trips to Third World nations that emphasize his social concerns; reflections on the dynamics of relationships between men and women; and a spiritual mysticism rooted in Christianity. Musically, too, there's a consistency to his folk-jazz-rock amalgam. The album features the vocal contributions of a rotating cast of three women who appear throughout the album. Jonell Mosser sings on two songs, including the single \"Last Night of the World.\" Margo Timmins of Cowboy Junkies lends her breathy pipes to two songs: the sultry \"Mango\" and a cover of the Fats Domino nugget \"Blueberry Hill\" that turns up the \"rock\" and de-emphasizes the \"roll.\" Most important, Lucinda Williams appears on four tracks. The standout track on the album is \"Isn't That What Friends Are For.\" This tender song of friendship is made more poignant by Williams' voice, which always manages to convey a deep sense of hurt. While the lyrics are sure to be enjoyed by those who are willing to listen and think, fans of Cockburn's guitar playing won't be disappointed, either.</p><p>There are two instrumental pieces, both band efforts, which feature Cockburn's acoustic guitar. \"Down to the Delta\" is an up-tempo tune, while \"Deep Lake\" is a quiet, more reflective piece that is close to the impressionistic style of Michael Hedges -- except, of course, that Cockburn has been playing this sort of thing since 1971's High Winds White Sky.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Martin Monkman</strong></p>"

It's been a quite a ride since 1970; the changes lyrically and musically have been enormous, and the world view of the artist — politically, spiritually, and psychologically — has evolved consciously and extensively. Of his many gifts, two of his most developed are his journalistic eye for detail, and having one ear always to the ground. This time out, the view is sharply contrasting from one song to the next. Politically, this is Cockburn's angriest record since World of Wonders or Stealing Fire. A listen to the hypnotic vibe of \"All Our Dark Tomorrows,\" with its spooky, Malian/Ali Farka Toure guitar vibe, points directly at the root of all human evil: greed. \"Trickle Down,\" an over-the-top jazz tune with Brazilian percussion and fine solos by Cockburn and pianist Andy Milne, reveals that by peeling away layer after layer, there are people who actually get paid to keep greed accumulating. But for Cockburn, righteous anger and indignant rage are never the whole picture. \"Put It in Your Heart\" is about the fierceness of love in the face of fear, both individual and collective, while \"Don't Forget About Delight,\" with its floating violin (Hugh Marsh) and harmonica (Gregoire Maret) lines entwining across the plaintive mix, is an exhortation to keep seeing the beauty with the inner eye despite the outward conditions and single-mindedness in this pursuit.</p><p>Sarah Harmer, Sam Phillips, Emmylou Harris, and Jackson Browne also help out on the vocal chores, and Cockburn borrowed Tom Waits' rhythm section of Larry Taylor and Stephen Hodges for balancing the wild musical ride this album is texturally and compositionally. The title track is among the most forward-thinking and sonically adventurous tracks he's ever recorded. Hand percussion and drum loops are interlaced with minimal piano and harmonica riffs shimmering on the fringes; the long, spoken (maybe even preachy) word travelog, full of horrific images and expressionistic electronica, gives way to a sung refrain that transcends the lyric but leaves the listener unsettled. \"Postcards From Cambodia\" is another one, full of detailed explications of conditions caused by other conditions that have come before, and on the refrain he concedes: \"This is too big for anger, too big for blame/We stumble through history, so humanly lame/So I bow down my head and say a prayer for us all/That we don't fear the spirit when it comes to call.\" Ultimately, this is the hinge track on the album, because Cockburn, despite the barely concealed fury that is contained within him, sees only a spiritual — and no, not necessarily \"Christian\" — solution to all of it, from the injustices to the anger and hatred he feels in his own heart for the perpetrators. Cockburn seems to be saying — and this is only this writer's interpretation of a very complex, wondrously intricate, and musically adventurous work — not to hate those whose actions cause suffering, but to root out the hatred in our own hearts so as not to become them. Action must come from compassion, not merely from anger, or it becomes nothing more than a mirror image of the cause of suffering itself. It is pointless to place this record in a pecking order with Cockburn's other work; that it adds to that body of work immeasurably is compliment enough. However, to say that it is necessary because it can cause self- and world-examination in any listener who plays it through is as high a compliment as can be offered.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Those who have followed his career over the past four decades wondered where he would go next, or indeed if there was anywhere he could go. The question has been answered in spades on Life Short Call Now. Along with his regular band, Cockburn has employed an orchestral 27-piece string section to expressionistically color a good number of these 12 songs with help from producer Jon Goldsmith. Lyrically, Cockburn has returned to the terrain he alone inhabits: intimate observations of the personal, the spiritual, the sociopolitical and environmental concerns. As is also his wont, there are no sloganeering anthems in these songs. Form the title track that opens the album he looks across the Montreal landscape and observes it, not in a journalistic way, but as someone inside it, and he asks poignantly. \"Can one man fit in a normal life?\" The solitary person in the midst of unions, holy and unholy, can find no way to properly say goodbye or welcome.</p> <p>Ani DiFranco sings backing vocals on \"See You Tomorrow,\" where Cockburn turns the tables on himself as he observes a mercenary, and though he understands the man's empty soul he envies his freedom from guilt to accomplish his task. Isolation in the midst of watching women walk mirrors the pain of sin and of loneliness for the beloved and seeks wholeness which he expresses that beyond \"these chains of flesh\" there is completion. The gentleness of his approach is also notable. Cockburn isn't raging here, he's expressing the hidden, the unseen, the unspeakable. Check the lovely, languid folk song \"Mystery,\" where he embraces what is unknowable infinitely despite his fear and his hunger for it. A four-piece horn section adorns the mix on the outside, underscoring the questions in the grain of the singer's voice. What happens as the record unfolds is the work of a poet who happens to be a brilliant musician, who has refined his craft not as an aesthete, but as a hands-dirtied participant not only in the process, but in its realization: check the gorgeous falsetto that croons above the swell of strings in \"Beautiful Creatures.\" He asks straight up, from the gut: \"When the skin is peeled off it/What is there to say?\" And then says it: The beautiful creatures are/going away...\"</p><p>In many ways, there is a tenderness here that Cockburn's listeners haven't encountered since \"Humans,\" where fear, desire, shock, awe and boundless love poured from his songs. And they do so here, too, tempered by a bloody but unbowed veteran of love, despair, spiritual hunger, desolation and the acknowledgement of community. Always a guitar to accompany that voice, always six strings whispering through the singer and carrying him through not only emotions, but scenes, places, times, encounters, to be able to speak clearly and directly, yet softly, with one exception: \"This Is Baghdad.\" Here the observer battles the brokenness inside himself as he observes -- Cockburn spent part of 2004 there -- the mindless destruction for the sake of nothing whatsoever. The display of might by American troops under the guidance of a fearful leader is revealed for what it is: the display of power for its own sake, which is for the sake of nothing. The deep end of the string section hovers around his 12-string, and the hypnotic pulse of Gary Craig's drums.</p><p>There are three fine instrumentals here as well. \"Peace March,\" is driven by that now-trademark fluid guitar kissed with a brushed snare, a tempered bassline which reveals the refined texture of a master painter. \"Jerusalem Poker\" with its handclapped percussion is a jazz tune with its syncopated guitar and muted flugelhorn. The album's final cut, too, named for Marcel Duchamp's infamous \"Nude Descending a Staircase\" is introduced by radio static, and then seamlessly flows into a guitar drive jazz tune with Cockburn playing a Byrdland electric guitar doing his best Wes Montgomery as strings shimmer and spiral down and a muted trumpet pushes down on the proceeding as more found sounds carry it out before the final cocking of what seems like a gun before the silence abruptly drapes the entire proceeding. Life Short Call Now is absent of metonymy or metaphor; it reports from the inside what is, and what should never be with equal wait, all the yearning for a convergence and a dusty grace to cover it all. Life Short Call Now reveals a seasoned artist at the absolute height of his powers lyrically and musically.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Speechless is the singer/songwriter's first foray into completely instrumental territory. There are 15 tracks here, the vast majority of which are redos of tracks from Cockburn's catalog. But given their treatment -- many of them done as solo guitar pieces -- the dearth of new material doesn't even matter. In fact, one could venture to say that these feel like altogether new pieces. Cockburn is a master guitarist; he often interweaves jazz, blues, country, and folk styles into his cross-genre songs. Here he shines, pure and simple. \"Train in the Rain\" (anyone notice how many of his songs are about trains and travel?) touches on Leo Kottke and Peter Lang; \"Water into Wine\" utilizes flamenco stylings while crossing into Gypsy jazz chords à la Charlie Byrd. A new work, \"Elegy,\" kisses the modalities of \"Greensleeves\" while creating itself as a piece that evokes both absence and memory. \"Rouler Sa Bosse\" from Salt, Sun and Time juxtaposes Cockburn's six-string against Jack Zaza's clarinet, and becomes a straight-up gently swinging jazz tune. The set also includes \"Rise and Fall,\" a sought-after trio track that was previously available only in Japan. Cockburn's steel-string is accented by his playing of bells, George Koller on bass, and drummer, Ben Riley! The new version of \"When It's Gone, It's Gone\" showcases an entire band that includes Booker T. Jones on organ and Edgar Meyer on bass, and is the only electric tune on the set. Another new work, \"The End of All Rivers,\" is a multi-tracked tune that has Cockburn playing not only guitar but Tibetan bowl, a Navajo flute, and a baritone guitar, which are all threaded though the melody as a digital delay marks time with his standard acoustic. It's spooky, elegiac, and utterly beguiling. The set ends with a down-home solo read of the title track from Sunwheel Dance. The most remarkable thing about Speechless is that, although it lies firmly in its own subcategory in Cockburn's catalog, it remains, despite the improvisation and textures, a recording of songs. The composer's need to establish that fact even in abstraction and extrapolation is commendable. Speechless is not only accessible -- it's downright beautiful, poetic, and seductive.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So pronounced is Bruce Cockburn's reputation as a celebrated singer-songwriter that it's easy to overlook the fact that Cockburn is also an exceptional guitarist. Speechless should change all that. A collection of previously recorded and brand new instrumental tracks, the album puts the spotlight squarely on Cockburn's brilliant acoustic guitar playing. Despite its absence of words, Speechless is highly expressive. Ranging from some of his earliest numbers to three recent compositions, the album showcases the breadth of Cockburn's eclectic guitar style. There's a strong cinematic quality to much of the album, whether it's in pieces from the 1970s like the haunting \"Islands in a Black Sky\" and the cascading \"Water into Wine,\" or else in 1990s instrumentals such as the emotional \"When It's Gone It's Gone\" and the ambient \"Mistress of Storms.\"</p>&mdash; <b>Amazon</b>"

		"review": "<p>Bruce Cockburn has issued numerous live recordings, and thus far all of them have been band offerings during the various periods of his 40-plus-year career. While the acoustic element has always been a primary part of his stage persona, fans — and the merely curious — have never had access to an official live document of those proceedings, until now. This double-disc set is a generous offering of 25 songs from all different stages of Cockburn's career, taped during May 2008. There were ten shows, and all of them have been sampled here, though the double-disc package has been edited to flow like a single performance in hopes of maintaining the flavor of a given concert. What's more, Cockburn and producer Colin Linden went a step further and added three tunes from the various soundchecks that took place before the gigs as a sort of encore. Along with Cockburn's stellar collection of songs, such as \"World of Wonders,\" \"Lovers in a Dangerous Time,\" \"How I Spent My Fall Vacation,\" \"Wondering Where the Lions Are,\" \"If I Had a Rocket Launcher,\" and \"Tie Me at the Crossroads,\" are beautiful instrumental interludes within tunes — and on the final disc as an intro to the soundcheck performances — that offer his mastery of the guitar as well. Among the final performances is a fine version of his early classic \"Mama Just Wants to Barrelhouse All Night Long.\" While it's true that there is nothing new here, that doesn't diminish the sense of creativity and spontaneity Cockburn is capable of in concert, making this a deeply rewarding purchase for longtime fans.</p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong>"

		"review": "<p>At a time when a growing number of pop songwriters were embracing a more explicitly poetic approach in their lyrics, the 1967 debut album from Leonard Cohen introduced a songwriter who, rather than being inspired by \"serious\" literature, took up music after establishing himself as a published author and poet. The ten songs on Songs of Leonard Cohen were certainly beautifully constructed, artful in a way few (if any) other lyricists would approach for some time, but what's most striking about these songs isn't Cohen's technique, superb as it is, so much as his portraits of a world dominated by love and lust, rage and need, compassion and betrayal. While the relationship between men and women was often the framework for Cohen's songs (he didn't earn the nickname \"the master of erotic despair\" for nothing), he didn't write about love; rather, Cohen used the never-ending thrust and parry between the sexes as a jumping off point for his obsessive investigation of humanity's occasional kindness and frequent atrocities (both emotional and physical).</p><p>Cohen's world view would be heady stuff at nearly any time and place, but coming in a year when pop music was only just beginning to be taken seriously, Songs of Leonard Cohen was a truly audacious achievement, as bold a challenge to pop music conventions as the other great debut of the year, The Velvet Underground & Nico, and a nearly perfectly realized product of his creative imagination. Producer John Simon added a touch of polish to Cohen's songs with his arrangements (originally Cohen wanted no accompaniment other than his guitar), though the results don't detract from his dry but emotive vocals; instead, they complement his lyrics with a thoughtful beauty and give the songs even greater strength. And a number of Cohen's finest songs appeared here, including the luminous \"Suzanne,\" the subtly venomous \"Master Song\" and \"Sisters of Mercy,\" which would later be used to memorable effect in Robert Altman's film McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Many artists work their whole career to create a work as singular and accomplished as Songs of Leonard Cohen, and Cohen worked this alchemy the first time he entered a recording studio; few musicians have ever created a more remarkable or enduring debut.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p><hr/><p>In his excellent 1997 biography of the Canadian poet, novelist, and singer/songwriter Leonard Cohen, Ira B. Nadel relates an anecdote that seems too perfectly symbolic to be true: A teenaged Cohen, after reading a book on hypnotism, successfully hypnotizes and undresses the family maid. This is the stuff of parable, presaging the hands-on mysticism, conflicted morality, and voracious lust that would come to define Cohen's art. The story also speaks to the peculiar effect of his music-- few singers leave us feeling so mesmerized and vulnerable.</p><p>On paper, Cohen's music is astoundingly simple. Because he became well-known as a poet and novelist in his 20s, there's a popular misconception that he didn't begin to play music until he started releasing albums in his 30s. But he became infatuated with the guitar at an early age, played in a country band called the Buckskin Boys at McGill University, and accompanied his poetry readings with live jazz, inspired by the Beat poets for whom he was a little too aristocratic to be taken seriously. He didn't become known as a musician until his 30s, but he was moving toward it his whole life, in an attempt to put his poetry where he thought it belonged-- with the people, not the academy.</p><p>Because of this long gestation period, Cohen's music seemed to emerge fully formed, and the qualities that dominate his first three, newly reissued albums can be succinctly cataloged. There's his reedy baritone-- a humble, melancholy  instrument and an inviting source of warmth; there's his unique guitar style-- most of his songs are built from delicate webs of musky, finger-picked flamenco or broad, awkward chord progressions; and there are his lyrics, tracing out the hidden contours of love, lust, sex, religion, responsibility, and history through an inflexibly personal lens.</p><p>There's also the uncanny ambiance of the songs, the almost brutal frugality of which is offset by calliope, bells, keyboards, strings, horns, and Jew's harp. While Cohen was resistant to such embellishments and particularly displeased with John Simon's arrangements on his debut, they've worn into the songs' creases. These reissues do a good job of bringing out the instrumentation     without crowding Cohen's voice or tainting the music's dark thrall, and an early version included on Songs from a Room reveals that \"Bird on a Wire\" isn't quite \"Bird on a Wire\" without those drafty keyboards pushing in under it.</p><p>This is enough to explain why these albums are good, but what makes them great is the ongoing search for personal truth and spiritual grace that they express, and how they manage to always embody both sides of their thematic coin. Everything is married to its dark twin: Freedom and shelter in \"The Stranger Song\", laughter and tears in \"So Long, Marianne\", salvation and destruction in \"Joan of Arc\", whom Cohen often used as a symbol for spiritual discipline and the power of womanhood.</p><p>We find this same dual nature in Cohen himself: Born to a stern religious father and a bohemian mother, Cohen's sensibility was forged in the tension between the liberal and the conservative. He's been a religious sensualist, a student of police work and law, bourgeois outsider poet, and disciplined dabbler in marijuana and LSD. While he emerged as a Dylan-inspired folkie, his music was anachronistic and only nominally political, less concerned with the timely issues of the day than the timeless issues of the spirit. Cohen was interested in \"The Old Revolution\", with its outmoded concepts of chivalry, and its religious (not secular) imperatives. The political ferment of the 60s manifests only obliquely, as in \"Story of Isaac\", which is as much about Cohen's awe of his father's stern religion as it is about the sacrifice of youths upon the altar of war.</p><p>It's appropriate then that Cohen's songs present him to us in far-flung locales. \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" finds him in a cold New York hotel, catching snippets of music wafting up from Clinton Street. In \"So Long, Marianne\", he's probably on Hydra, a pale spectre amid the Grecian island's greenery and whitewashed terraces. In \"Suzanne\", eating Chinese oranges on the St. Lawrence river in Montreal. In \"Diamonds in the Mine\", checking his empty mailbox on an isolated farm outside of Nashville.</p><p>All three of these albums, despite their musical simplicity, are leavened with the wisdom that comes from such a diverse existence. 1968's Songs of Leonard Cohen contains many of his most essential songs-- \"Suzanne\", \"Master Song\", \"Stranger Song\", \"Sisters of Mercy\", \"So Long, Marianne\"-- and establishes the themes and stylistic tics he would pursue relentlessly over the ensuing decades. John Hammond, the album's original producer, fell ill during the process and was replaced by John Simon;  the two bonus cuts are from the Hammond sessions. \"Store Room\" emulates the restrained urgency of \"Teachers\" while \"Blessed is the Memory\" is more prayerful; both feature rather incongruous Ray Manzarek-style organs.</p><p>A long-time country music fan, Cohen would travel to Nashville to record his next two albums. 1969's Songs From a Room is similar to his debut: Just as Songs of Leonard Cohen replaced original producer John Hammond, who had signed Cohen to Columbia (as well as Billie Holiday and Bob Dylan) with John Simon (then just off the Band's Music From Big Pink and Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends), this album was started with the Byrds' David Crosby and finished with Dylan producer Bob Johnston. It also contains a number of Cohen's signature tunes, including \"Story of Isaac\", cover song \"The Partisan\", \"Lady Midnight\", and the seminal \"Bird on a Wire\", whose iconic opening lines (\"Like a bird on a wire/ Like a drunk in a midnight choir/ I have tried, in my way, to be free\") were cited by Kris Kristofferson as his desired epitaph. It seems a direct continuation of his debut, and in truth, the debut seems superior simply for having come first.</p><p>Of course, any seeker can become lost, and on 1971's Songs of Love and Hate, Cohen shows signs of disorientation. Though he's backed by a crew of ace musicians, including Charlie Daniels on fiddle, the record is thinner and less even than the first two. In contrast to his early precision, Cohen takes some wild swings that miss the mark, such as the weird Santa Claus imagery on \"Dress Rehearsal Rag\" and the uncomfortably strained singing style he adopts on \"Diamonds in the Mine\", which might be chalked up to an insecurity about his voice encouraged by his negative press. It's also a more blatantly depressive album than the first two, lacking hopeful equanimity, and does indeed reflect a period of great depression and uncertainty in Cohen's life.           But elsewhere on Love and Hate, he's in his finest, subtlest form-- \"Avalanche\", \"Last Year's Man\", and \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" alone justify the album's classic status. Despite its relative flaws, it's an indispensable document in the development of one of the 20th century's most enduring artists. Cohen potently captures the pull between safety and the unknown, love and freedom, spirituality and sensuality: a panoramic view of human experience, rendered through the work of one exceptional artist.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Brian Howe, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Leonard Cohen's first album was an unqualified triumph which announced the arrival of a bold and singular talent, and many who heard it must have wondered what Cohen could do for an encore. By comparison, Cohen's second album, 1969's Songs from a Room, was something of a letdown. While it's a fine LP, it ultimately feels neither as striking nor as assured as Songs of Leonard Cohen. Bob Johnston stepped in as producer for Songs from a Room, and his arrangements are simpler than those John Simon crafted for the debut, but they're also full of puzzling accents, such as the jew's harp that punctuates several tracks, the churchy organ line in \"The Old Revolution,\" and the harsh synthesizer flourishes on \"A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes.\" Johnston also had trouble coaxing strong vocal performances from Cohen; his singing here sounds tentative and his meter is uncertain, which regardless of how one feels about Cohen's much-debated vocal prowess is not the case with his other work. And finally, the quality of the songs on Songs from a Room is less consistent than on Songs of Leonard Cohen; as fine as \"Bird on a Wire,\" \"You Know Who I Am,\" \"The Story of Isaac\" and \"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\" may be, \"The Butcher\" and \"A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes\" simply aren't up to his usual standards. Despite the album's flaws, Songs from a Room's strongest moments convey a naked intimacy and fearless emotional honesty that's every bit as powerful as the debut, and it left no doubt that Cohen was a major creative force in contemporary songwriting.</p><p><strong>&mdash; Mark Deming</strong></p>"

Culled from a series of 1972 concerts (except for \"Tonight Will Be Fine\" from the Isle of Wight festival), the album consists of compositions from 1969's Songs From a Room and a handful of otherwise unavailable material. Those familiar with Songs From a Room will find that the live versions improve upon their studio counterparts, which sound like they were recorded down a well. The spirited hoedown rendition of \"Tonight Will Be Fine\" includes two extra verses, and the lovely, restrained performance of \"Bird on the Wire\" may be definitive. As for the oddities, Dick Blakeslee's spry political allegory, \"Passing Through,\" suits Cohen's dry delivery, and the hypnotic instrumental \"Improvisation\" reveals a rarely seen side of his musical personality. Curiously enough, the haunting prologue and the poem-as-dirge \"Queen Victoria\" don't seem to have been recorded live at all. The centerpiece of the album, however, is \"Please Don't Pass Me By,\" a monstrous 12-minute rant, both outrageous and deadly serious, apparently half written, half made up on the spot. Cohen dedicates the song to a host of outcasts, including \"the cripples, the maimed, the freaks...the burned, the burning...the Jews and the gypsies\" killed in the Holocaust, \"the children of England,\" and \"a savior with no one to save,\" then goes on to beg some unspecified addressee (the listener?) to get naked for him. Before the song is over, he declares that he can't stand himself and instructs the members of the audience to \"go home with someone else.\" Only a daredevil artist could freak out so totally and articulately before a crowd of paying customers. Cohen fanatics will know they've hit the jackpot when they hear Live Songs. Anyone who cares about poetry and raw emotional honesty in popular music should at least find it interesting.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Daniel Browne</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The London foursome Coldplay are constant critic's darlings in the band's native U.K., showcasing melodic pop in a slew of EP releases and constant live shows since the spark of the new millennium. Not as heavy as Radiohead or snobbish as Oasis, Coldplay is a band of young musicians who are still honing their sweet harmonies on the debut release <i>Parachutes</i>. Combining bits of distorted guitar riffs and swishing percussion, <i>Parachutes</i> is a delightful introduction and also quickly indicates the reason why this album earned Coldplay a Mercury Music Prize nomination in fall 2000.</p><p>Frontman Chris Martin's lyrical wordplay is feministic in the manner of Geneva's Andrew Montgomery, but far more withered. The imagery captured on <i>Parachutes</i> is exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive, and the entire composition is tractable thanks to gauzy acoustics and airy percussion. Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as \"Don't Panic\" and \"Shiver,\" but it's the dream pop soundscapes captured on \"High Speed\" and \"We Never Change\" that illustrate the band's dynamic passion. This basic pop is surely a refreshing effort in the face of big productions like the Spice Girls and Westlife. <i>Parachutes</i> deserves the accolades it has received because it follows the general rule when introducing decent pop songs: keep the emotion genuine and real. And Coldplay has done that without hesitation.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>MacKenzie Wilson</strong></p><hr/><p>Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate,     satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable,     safe, forgettable.          I have just summed up in 19 words what I am about to say about Coldplay's     debut full-length, Parachutes, in 600.  Aside from being seemingly     tailor-made for the paper-thin adult contemporary market, what is it about     this Britrock quartet that's driving them up the American charts? Is it their     popularity in their home country, or their Mercury Music Prize nomination?     Could it be their charming, boyish good looks?  Perhaps, even, a reputation     built by Noel Gallagher's projected insistence that they're \"a bunch of fuckin'     pansies, the lot of them?\"          In reality, Coldplay's secret deadly weapon is vocalist Chris Martin. With     the ability to mimic a Brit-accented Dave Matthews one minute, Jeff Buckley     revived from the dead the next, and sometimes even a young Peter Gabriel,     Martin's heartfelt delivery seems to be what's winning the hearts, wallets     and alternative radio request lines of Americans young and old. That's not to     say that the rest of the group isn't sharp. Guitarist Jon Buckland provides     plaintive, strummed acoustic guitar with the occasional amplified wail, and     bassist Guy Berryman with drummer Will Champion form a competent rhythm     section.          Oh yeah, the songs. They're nothing special. Most of the 10 tracks on     Parachutes are indeed pleasant enough, often consisting of standard     alterna-pop fare with the occasional folky ballad. They're innocent and     inoffensive in general, but in turn, they're also exceedingly generic     and immediately forgettable-- so much so, in fact, that after a minute of one     song, you've usually already forgotten what the last song sounded like.  And     that's even after a few listens. Parachutes opens with \"Don't Panic,\" the title of which is likely     lifted from British mock sci-fi classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the     Galaxy, despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with it. This     subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of \"We live in a     beautiful world,\" which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record;     the record also closes with the inspirational swinger \"Everything's Not Lost.\"          Most of the other songs sort of drift in and out of consciousness, with the     exception of the second track, \"Shiver.\" It's the only truly decent song on     Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows     its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song:     Jeff Buckley's \"Grace.\" Martin has his Buckley impression down cold, complete     with dynamic range and the trademark vibrato.  But as enjoyable as the song     may be, there's no question that Buckley did it better.          And of course, you've probably heard their smash hit single, \"Yellow,\" by now.     Indeed, it's the most obvious choice for a single, and it represents     Martin's vocal stylings effectively, but it's also the record's weakest moment.     Buckland's grating, slightly tuneless guitars seem jarring, especially when     sequenced in the middle of a series of songs that generally lack dissonance.     And the saccharine lyrics are those that might have caused Mr. Gallagher's     hypothetical remark: \"Look at the stars/ Look how they shine for you/ And     everything you do.\" You'd practically expect the band to show up at your     doorstep with a wilting bouquet and Hallmark card. Parachutes is ultimately a promising debut for Coldplay, if by     \"promising,\" I mean, \"promising them a windfall of cash and international     popularity.\" If nothing else, it's harmless and pretty. Unfortunately, it's     nothing else.  If that's what you look for in your music, by all means, go     for it.  If you want substance, I suggest moving on.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Spencer Owen, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>After touring in support of their debut album, <i>Parachutes</i>, Coldplay was personally and professionally exhausted. Frontman Chris Martin insisted he was dry; by the time they closed their European tour in summer 2001, he hadn't written a song in months. The U.K. music press immediately pounced on the idea of Coldplay calling it quits, but somewhere lurked the beauty of \"In My Place.\" The spirit and soul of this ballad allowed Coldplay to pull it together to make a second album. What came from such anguish and inquisition was <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>. Coldplay has surely let it all go on this record. Acoustics are drowned out by Jon Buckland's riveting guitar work, and vocally, Martin has sharpened his falsetto, refining his haunting delivery. It's a strong album; you can feel, hear, and touch the blood, sweat, and tears behind each song, and that's exactly what Coldplay was going for. Co-producer Ken Nelson and mixer Mark Pythain (the team behind the blissful beauty of <i>Parachutes</i>) allowed Coldplay to make an album that's initially inaccessible, but that's what makes it intriguing. Lush melodies and a heartbreak behind the songs are there, but also a newfound confidence.</p><p>From the delicate, shimmery classic \"In My Place\" to the piano surge of \"The Scientist,\" Coldplay exudes an honest passion. The disco haze of \"Daylight\" and the lovedrunk ballad \"Green Eyes\" are divine examples of solid lyrical arrangements, but \"Politik\" and the stunning guitar-driven \"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\" project a nervy edge to the band. Echoes of early post-punk showcase Coldplay's ballsy musicianship. Don't fret — it's not exactly rock &amp; roll, but Radiohead, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and The Smiths aren't exactly rock &amp; roll either, and they're well-loved. \"Yellow\" didn't follow the rock formula, but it sold well, and similarly <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> might not instantly grab listeners, but it's not tailored that way. It pushes you to look beyond dreamy vocals for a musical inner core. Regardless of the band still being in their mid-twenties, they've made an amazing record, and if it ends up being their last, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> didn't sugar coat anything. It's a bittersweet design no matter what.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>MacKenzie Wilson</strong></p><hr/><p>Though my hopes were briefly raised by a frazzled Christopher Lloyd in 1985, it's painfully obvious now     that time travel doesn't exist as a human technological capability.  This being overwhelmingly the case, I     will try my best to transport with words, and paint a picture of another time-- a time ever so slightly     more innocent, when terrorism wasn't being used as an excuse to crush civil liberties and drop bombs on     mustachioed megalomaniacs.  So, drag that bottle of Orbitz out of the back of the closet, put X-Files     on the VHS, and journey back with me to the year 2000.          It was a wondrous time-- we were still fascinated by the three zeros that had signified the birth of the     new millennium, and many were relieved to have escaped judgment from an infinite, intangible being.  Then,     toward the end of the year, we began to hear rumblings from the many-headed hydra of UK rock journalism     that some amazing new music had come to usher us into the New World.  This music was deemed fascinating,     uncompromising and utterly prizeworthy by our English brethren, who spoke in hushed tones of how it was     to be the coming of \"the next Radiohead,\" or perhaps more tellingly, \"the next Travis.\"          This new music was produced by a band of four affable blue-collar lads from Europe's island neighbor who     called themselves Coldplay, and before you knew it, there was no escaping their lead-off single, \"Yellow\",     as it burned itself into the national consciousness via extensive radio exposure and ABC promotional spots.     I, myself, was never too taken with that single, though I openly admit to enjoying the album it was culled     from, Parachutes.  It was innocuous, to be sure, but it was also honestly rendered, and the opening     three songs, effortless and hummable as they were, were hard to deny.          Two years and a veritable avalanche of press later, A Rush of Blood to the Head has Coldplay taking     a second shot at it, and to be perfectly honest, what they throw at the wall doesn't stick quite as well.     I will credit them where it's due: they've admirably eschewed cloning their debut album, a path that would     have been all too easy to take given that record's critical and commercial success.  But while the sound of     this album is more expansive, the influences a bit less obvious, and the approach more varied, the guys     forgot to tote along their initial strength: the songs.          Atmospherically, a couple of these tracks are remarkable-- particularly \"Daylight\", with its swooping guitar     and synth lines.  Even its strings, which echo melodies from Suede's last album, lend a sense of drama to a     song that otherwise wouldn't hold much.  Midtempo non-rockers \"Green Eyes\" and \"Warning Sign\" stretch the     most obvious thread back to Parachutes with their lovelorn lyrics and slightly more developed     melodies.  And there are also a couple of \"memo to listener: we can rock, too!\" moments, specifically \"A     Whisper\" and the lite-apocalypse of opener \"Politik\".  The latter essentially takes the blueprint of     \"Yellow\"-- namely, the slamming, repetitive strumming of clean electric guitar-- and builds a more spacious     song from it, one with more rattle and hum, but less melodic substance.  Martin's double-tracked vocals     hover curiously low in the mix and the band thrashes earnestly, but all the listener really comes away with     is a nebular dustcloud and the sense that Coldplay want to break out of their box.          Part of the blame for moments like these rests on producer Ken Nelson, who doesn't seem to know what to do     with the band's expanded sound this time out.  He alternately dries up the quietest passages and drenches     the louder sections with Martin Hannett-sized reverb tides.  It takes a lot of discretion to handle that     sound, and the folly of Nelson and the band (who co-produced) often comes at the expense of the vocals,     which frequently get lost in the haze.          And that's a shame because vocalist Chris Martin has improved since the band's not-so-humble beginnings--     his voice is dramatically fuller than in the past, and he falters less on the higher notes.  But, of course,     he's still far from foolproof: at times, his attempts to broaden his palette don't pan out, such as during     the regrettable midsection of \"Clocks\", where he barely bothers to add a melody to the central lyric \"nothing     else compares.\"  To his credit, he does manage a pretty good verse melody here, but then he oddly shies     away from what should be the hook at the end, tentatively trailing off as though he's not sure it's     good enough.          That could very well be the case, too, as it's been widely posited that Coldplay nearly didn't make this     album at all, fearing that they didn't have the depth to provide an adequate follow-up to their debut. I'll     avoid the obvious cheap shot there and instead offer that they indeed still might.  Parachutes proved     that Coldplay have at least a nascent songwriting capability, and A Rush of Blood to the Head shows     them testing themselves musically, so it seems logical that if their third album were to combine those     strengths they might finally start to sound like the band the UK press is always going on about.          After over a half-dozen listens, I still haven't taken anything away from A Rush of Blood to the Head     (by contrast, I recognized Parachutes' \"Don't Panic\" for the relatively tight song it is after hearing     it once), and my girl, who was much more a fan of Parachutes than I was, sums it up as \"boring.\"     She's pretty much got it right.  Coldplay may claw their way back from this, but it'll be a pretty steep     climb.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Joe Tangari, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

The band impressed the masses this time out, and once again it delivers a resilient, bright package of glorious rock &amp; roll. Capturing an evening at Sydney's Horden Pavillion, the momentum and passion behind such songs as \"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\" and \"Politik\" confirm Coldplay's place in music while also illustrating their power as a live act. <I>Live 2003</I> is clean-cut and solid from start to finish. The meticulous production of the dozen-song set list itself is exemplary of the band's first two efforts; therefore doing a live album such as this proves Coldplay's brilliance. From the sonic richness of B-side \"One I Love\" to the band's more merry singles like \"Yellow\" and \"Clocks,\" <I>Live 2003</I> is a delightful listening experience. Coldplay treat fans to a new song, \"Moses.\" Chiming guitars and Chris Martin's hushed vocals give this song a classic feeling circa Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's 1988 self-titled release, and fans will be impressed by Coldplay's progression in style and sound. Like the U.K. and domestic releases, the Japanese DVD portion includes the show in Sydney as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the tour and a tour-diary documentary.</p> &mdash; <B>MacKenzie Wilson</B>"

		"review": "<p>After Radiohead stubbornly refused to accept the mantle of world's biggest and most important rock band by releasing the willfully strange rocktronica fusion Kid A in 2000, Coldplay stepped up to the plate with their debut, Parachutes. Tasteful, earnest, introspective, anthemic, and grounded in guitars, the British quartet was everything Radiohead weren't but what the public wanted them to be, and benefited from the Oxford quintet's decision to abandon rock stardom for arcane art rock. Parachutes became was a transatlantic hit and 2002's sequel, A Rush of Blood to the Head, consolidated their success by being bigger and better than Parachutes, positioning Coldplay to not be just the new Radiohead, but the new U2: a band that belongs to the world but whose fans believe that the music is for them alone. To that end, Coldplay's third album, X&Y -- slightly delayed so it follows Rush of Blood by nearly three years, but that's no longer than the time separating OK Computer and Kid A, or The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree -- is designed to be the record that elevates Coldplay to the major leagues, where they are at once the biggest and most important band in the world. It's deliberate and sleek, cinematic and pristine, hip enough to sample Kraftwerk and blend in fashionable retro-'80s post-punk allusions without altering the band's core. Indeed, X&Y is hardly a bold step forward but rather a consolidation of Coldplay's strengths, particularly their skill at crafting surging, widescreen epics. But if X&Y highlights their attributes it also brings Coldplay's weaknesses into sharp relief. Forget the fact that they, by any stretch of the imagination, do not rock -- rocking is simply against their nature. They are a meditative band, reflecting on their emotions instead of letting them go in a cathartic blast of noise and rhythm. This isn't a problem -- after all, there have been plenty of great bands that do not rock & roll -- but their terminal politeness does cripple their music, preventing it from being as majestic as its aspirations. Coldplay is well scrubbed and well behaved, possessing a textbook education in classic rock and the good sense to never stretch any farther than needed. They are the perfect middlebrow rock band -- clean, pristine, and rational, seemingly smart since they never succumb to pounding, primal riffs, but also not weird enough to be genuine art rock. It's ambitious, yet its ambitions are modest, not risky, so their ambitions can be fulfilled without breaking a sweat. And since their sweeping yet subdued theatricality does recall the more majestic moments of Radiohead and U2, they have won millions of fans, but another crucial reason that Coldplay have a broad appeal is that lead singer/songwriter Chris Martin never tackles any large issues, preferring to endlessly examine his feelings. Like on Parachutes and Rush of Blood, all the songs on X&Y are ruminations on Martin's doubts, fears, hopes, and loves. His words are earnest and vague, so listeners can identify with the underlying themes in the songs, and his plain, everyman voice, sighing as sweet as a schoolboy, is unthreatening and unassuming, so it's all the easier for listeners to project their own emotions into the song. But for as impeccable as X&Y is -- and, make no mistake, it's a good record, crisp, professional, and assured, a sonically satisfying sequel to A Rush of Blood to the Head -- it does reveal that Martin's solipsism is a dead-end, diminishing the stature of the band. Where U2 is big in sound, scope, ambition, and intent, Coldplay is ultimately big music about small things, and even if X&Y is a strong, accomplished album, its limited, narcissistic point of view is what prevents the quartet from inheriting the title of the biggest and most important band in the world.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>When Coldplay sampled Kraftwerk on their third album, X&Y, it was a signifier for the British band, telegraphing their classicist good taste while signaling how they prefer the eternally hip to the truly adventurous; it was stylish window dressing for soft arena rock. Hiring Brian Eno to produce the bulk of their fourth album, Viva la Vida, is another matter entirely. Eno pushes them, not necessarily to experiment but rather to focus and refine, to not leave their comfort zone but to find some tremulous discomfort within it. In his hands, this most staid of bands looks to shake things up, albeit politely, but such good manners are so inherent to Coldplay's DNA that they remain courteous even when they experiment. With his big-budget production, Eno has a knack for amplifying an artist's personality, as he allows bands to be just as risky as they want to be — which is quite a lot in the case of U2 and James and even Paul Simon, but not quite so much with Coldplay. And yet this gentle encouragement — he's almost a kindly uncle giving his nephews permission to rummage through his study — pays great dividends for Coldplay, as it winds up changing the specifics without altering the core. They wind up with the same self-styled grandiosity; they've just found a more interesting way to get to the same point.</p><p>Gone are Chris Martin's piano recitals and gone are the washes of meticulously majestic guitar, replaced by orchestrations of sound, sometimes literally consisting of strings but usually a tapestry of synthesizers, percussion, organs, electronics, and guitars that avoid playing riffs. Gone too are simpering schoolboy ballads like \"Fix You,\" and along with them the soaring melodies designed to fill arenas. In fact, there are no insistent hooks to be found anywhere on Viva la Vida, and there are no clear singles in this collection of insinuatingly ingratiating songs. This reliance on elliptical melodies isn't off-putting — alienation is alien to Coldplay — and this is where Eno's guidance pays off, as he helps sculpt Viva la Vida to work as a musical whole, where there are long stretches of instrumentals and where only \"Strawberry Swing,\" with its light, gently infectious melody and insistent rhythmic pulse, breaks from the album's appealingly meditative murk. Whatever iciness there is to the sound of Viva la Vida is warmed by Martin's voice, but the music is by design an heir to the earnest British art rock of '80s Peter Gabriel and U2 — arty enough to convey sober intelligence without seeming snobby, the kind of album that deserves to take its title from Frida Kahlo and album art from Eugene Delacroix. That Delacroix painting depicts the French Revolution, so it does fit that Martin tones down his relentless self-obsession — the songs aren't heavy on lyrics and some are shockingly written in character — which is a development as welcome as the expanded sonic palette. Martin's refined writing topics may be outpaced by the band's guided adventure, but they're both indicative that Coldplay are desperate to not just strive for the title of great band — a title they seem to believe that they're to the manor born — but to actually burrow into the explorative work of creating music. And so the greatest thing Coldplay may have learned from Eno is his work ethic, as they demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album — it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X&Y and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head — that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>History will undoubtedly enshrine this disc as a watershed the likes of which may never truly be appreciated. Giant Steps bore the double-edged sword of furthering the cause of the music as well as delivering it to an increasingly mainstream audience. Although this was John Coltrane's debut for Atlantic, he was concurrently performing and recording with Miles Davis. Within the space of less than three weeks, Coltrane would complete his work with Davis and company on another genre-defining disc, Kind of Blue, before commencing his efforts on this one. Coltrane (tenor sax) is flanked by essentially two different trios. Recording commenced in early May of 1959 with a pair of sessions that featured Tommy Flanagan (piano) and Art Taylor (drums), as well as Paul Chambers -- who was the only bandmember other than Coltrane to have performed on every date. When recording resumed in December of that year, Wynton Kelly (piano) and Jimmy Cobb (drums) were instated -- replicating the lineup featured on Kind of Blue, sans Miles Davis of course. At the heart of these recordings, however, is the laser-beam focus of Coltrane's tenor solos. All seven pieces issued on the original Giant Steps are likewise Coltrane compositions. He was, in essence, beginning to rewrite the jazz canon with material that would be centered on solos -- the 180-degree antithesis of the art form up to that point. These arrangements would create a place for the solo to become infinitely more compelling. This would culminate in a frenetic performance style that noted jazz journalist Ira Gitler accurately dubbed \"sheets of sound.\" Coltrane's polytonal torrents extricate the amicable and otherwise cordial solos that had begun decaying the very exigency of the genre -- turning it into the equivalent of easy listening. He wastes no time as the disc's title track immediately indicates a progression from which there would be no looking back. Line upon line of highly cerebral improvisation snake between the melody and solos, practically fusing the two. The resolute intensity of \"Countdown\" does more to modernize jazz in 141 seconds than many artists do in their entire careers. Tellingly, the contrasting and ultimately pastoral \"Naima\" was the last tune to be recorded, and is the only track on the original long-player to feature the Kind of Blue quartet. What is lost in tempo is more than recouped in intrinsic melodic beauty. Both Giant Steps [Deluxe Edition] and the seven-disc Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings offer more comprehensive presentations of these sessions.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

It also provided him with a signature hit, as his new group conception came together wonderfully on the title track. It's an extended modal reworking in 6/4 time that brought the hypnotic pulsating quality of Indian music into jazz for the first time, with Coltrane's soprano wailing over the oscillating piano chords and pulsing drums. The unusual up-tempo version of Gershwin's \"Summertime\"is a heated example of Coltrane's \"sheets of sound\" approach to conventional changes, while \"But Not for Me\" receives a radical harmonic makeover. This is an excellent introduction to Coltrane's work.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stuart Broomer - Spotlight Reviews</strong></p><p>Although seemingly impossible to comprehend, this landmark jazz recording was made in less than three days. All the more remarkable is that the same sessions which yielded <em>My Favorite Things</em> would also inform a majority of the albums <em>Coltrane Plays the Blues</em>, <em>Coltrane's Sound</em>, and <em>Coltrane Legacy</em>. It is easy to understand the appeal that these sides continue to hold. The unforced, practically casual soloing styles of the assembled quartet — which includes Coltrane (soprano/tenor sax), McCoy Tyner (piano), Steve Davis (bass), and Elvin Jones (drums) — allow for tastefully executed passages à la the Miles Davis Quintet, a trait Coltrane no doubt honed during his tenure in that band. Each track of this album is a joy to revisit. The ultimate listenability may reside in this quartet's capacity to not be overwhelmed by the soloist. Likewise, they are able to push the grooves along surreptitiously and unfettered. For instance, the support that the trio — most notably Tyner — gives to Coltrane on the title track winds the melody in and around itself. However, instead of becoming entangled and directionless, these musicalsidebars simultaneously define the direction the song is taking. Asa soloist, the definitive soprano sax runs during the Cole Porter standard \"Everytime We Say Goodbye\" and tenor solos on \"But Not for Me\"easily establish Coltrane as a pioneer of both instruments.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>One of the most important records ever made, John Coltrane's A Love Supreme was his pinnacle studio outing, that at once compiled all of the innovations from his past, spoke to the current of deep spirituality that liberated him from addictions to drugs and alcohol, and glimpsed at the future innovations of his final two and a half years. Recorded over two days in December 1964, Trane's classic quartet--Elvin Jones, McCoy Tyner, and Jimmy Garrison-- stepped into the studio and created one of the most the most thought-provoking, concise, and technically pleasing albums of their bountiful relationship. From the undulatory (and classic) bassline at the intro to the last breathy notes, Trane is at the peak of his logical and emotionally varied soloing, while the rest of the group is completely atttuned to his spiritual vibe. Composed of four parts, each has a thematic progression. \"Acknowledgement\" is the awakening to a spiritual life from the darkness of the world; it trails off with the saxophonist chanting the suite's title. \"Resolution\" is an amazingly beautiful, somewhat turbulent segment. It portrays the dedication required for discovery on the path toward spiritual understanding. \"Pursuance\" searches deeply for that experience, while \"Psalm\" portrays that discovery and the realization of enlightenment with humility. Although sometimes aggressive and dissonant, this isn't Coltrane at his most furious or adventurous. His recordings following this period--studio and live-- become progressively untethered and extremely spirited. A Love Supreme not only attempts but realizes the ambitious undertaking of Coltrane's concept; his emotional, searching, sometimes prayerful journey is made abundantly clear. Clocking in at 33 minutes; A Love Supreme conveys much without overstatement. It is almost impossible to imagine any jazz collection without it.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Sam Samuelson</strong></p><hr/><p>John Coltrane was a late bloomer. Born in 1926, the same year as Miles Davis, he spent his twenties in and out of small-time bands, a promising journeyman moving between playing jazz and the more bar-friendly music that was starting to be called R&B. During these early years he had problems with narcotics and alcohol, alternating stretches of heroin use with periods of binge drinking. Charlie Parker—every sax player's hero when Coltrane was coming up in the 1940s and '50s—had given the junkie life a romantic aura for some naive souls, connecting drug use with creativity. But the underachieving Coltrane was a run-of-the-mill addict, someone broke and in ill health whose habit clearly kept him stuck in place. He was fired from Miles Davis' band in 1957 for showing up on the bandstand dressed in shabby clothes and visibly drunk—by some accounts he took a punch from the trumpeter before being given his walking papers. And if Coltrane had spiraled and his career had ended there, he'd be remembered now as a musician who flamed out just as he was discovering his voice.</p><p>But that's not what happened. Everything changed for Coltrane in 1957 when, as he wrote in the liner notes to his defining album, A Love Supreme, he \"experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life.\" During that year, Coltrane stopped drinking and kicked heroin, and from that point forward, his career would unfold with an almost frightening amount of focus and intensity. These final 10 years are when Coltrane made his mark on the world of jazz as a leader, and he was then seemingly always on the move, in transition, each moment glimpsed as a blur on a continuum rather than a fixed point in space. He wasn't just covering ground, he was accelerating, and every phase of his later career has the attendant feeling of stomach-dropping free-fall, of being pushed forcefully into new places.</p><p>A Love Supreme, recorded with what was later called his classic quartet, is Coltrane's musical expression of his 1957 epiphany. It's the sound of a man laying his soul bare. Structured as a suite and delivered in praise of God, everything about the record is designed for maximum emotional impact, from Elvin Jones' opening gong crash to the soft rain of McCoy Tyner's piano clusters to Coltrane's stately fanfare to Jimmy Garrison's iconic four-note bassline to the spoken chant by Coltrane—\"a-LOVE-su-PREME, a-LOVE-su-PREME\"—that carries out the opening movement, \"Acknowledgement\". By the time the record gets to the closing \"Psalm\", which finds Coltrane interpreting on his saxophone the syllables of a poem he'd written to the Creator, A Love Supreme has wrung its concept dry, extracting every drop of feeling from Coltrane's initial vision. It's as complete a statement as exists in recorded jazz. Hearing it now as part of this exhaustive 3xCD set, which gathers every scrap of material recorded during the sessions as well as a live performance of the suite from later the same year, you get a clearer sense than ever before of the different forms A Love Supreme might have taken, and how Coltrane's desire to communicate something specific and profound led to its final shape.</p><p>A Love Supreme is also one of the most popular albums in the last 60 years of jazz, selling the kind of numbers usually reserved for pop (it quickly sold more than 100,000 copies, and has almost certainly sold more than a million since). If Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is the most frequently bought first jazz album for those curious about the genre, A Love Supreme is easily number two. But though they were released just seven years apart, there's a world of difference between the two records, and the success of A Love Supreme is trickier to explain. For all its structural daring, Kind of Blue also functions as an ambient record, with slower tempos and a late-night vibe. A Love Supreme is harder to get a handle on. If you can think of Coltrane's work on a continuum, from the gorgeous melodicism of \"My Favorite Things\" or Ballads or his album with Duke Ellington on one end and the brutal noise assault of the 1966 concerts collected on Concert in Japan on the other, A Love Supreme sits perfectly at the fulcrum, challenging enough to continually reveal new aspects but accessible enough to inspire newcomers.</p><p>Coltrane may have structured the record for just this effect. He had already been further \"out\" than the music heard on A Love Supreme, including some of the knotty extended jams like \"Chasin' the Trane\" recorded at his 1961 sessions at the Village Vanguard. He was fascinated with the innovations of Ornette Coleman from the minute he heard them in the late '50s, and though he never completely abandoned chord changes, he regularly flirted with atonality, improvising outside of a fixed key. With A Love Supreme, it was almost as though Coltrane knew he had to dial things back a little in order to share his message of spiritual rebirth with a wider audience. Though conventionally beautiful in many ways, A Love Supreme is, for many, the exact point beyond which jazz becomes too experimental.</p><p>It's possible to hear on this set how the album might have gone even further. At a time when a single track might have a dozen collaborators working on it over the course of weeks, it's a little mind-boggling to consider that the music on A Love Supreme was recorded on a single day, December 9, 1964. This wasn't uncommon for jazz records of the time. But though they had the music in the can from that first day, Coltrane wanted to try something else. So on December 10, he called the young tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp, and a second bassist, Art Davis to play with his quartet. The six musicians then ran through two versions of A Love Supreme's opening \"Acknowledgment\", so that Coltrane could explore what the music might sound like with another horn and additional low-end rhythm. Shepp was an up-and-comer deeply influenced by Coltrane; the two takes of \"Acknowledgment\" featuring Shepp find him serving as a kind of textural counterpoint, his more brittle and biting tone commenting on the melody from an oblique angle and hinting at possibilities existing outside of the version recorded the day before. You sense a more abrasive road not taken, one that almost certainly would have found a smaller audience.</p><p>We hear a different perspective on the fantastic live version of the suite recorded in France five months after the album's release. Five months in '60s Coltrane time was like a decade in the career of other jazz musicians, and he was already imbuing the A Love Supreme material with an extra intensity. Tyner's clanging chords on \"Resolution\" have a harsher edge, and Coltrane's attendant soloing is much rougher and more pointed, his notes seeming to attack the structure of the composition from several directions rather than floating along above it. This is the hard-blowing sound that Coltrane would show on Meditations, another spiritually focused album-length suite recorded later in 1965 that never had a chance at A Love Supreme's level of mainstream acceptance.</p><p>In the same year, Coltrane would also record Om and Ascension, two harsh and challenging pieces of music that strain against the boundaries of what most people would even consider music. Given what surrounds it, and how sweet and gentle it so often is, A Love Supreme was an expression of a very specific time and place, a conscious attempt by Coltrane to communicate something to his audience that was broad enough to be understood but rich and complex enough to honor both where he was as a musician and the depth of the subject matter. A Love Supreme sounds like nothing else in John Coltrane's discography, and indeed like little else in recorded jazz, sitting at the nexus of so many competing musical ideas.</p><p>The final piece of the A Love Supreme equation concerns the civil rights movement and black liberation, and how those swirling ideas were inextricably tangled up with the jazz avant-garde.  Coltrane was never overtly political, but he did allow his thoughts and feelings to bleed into his music. Coltrane met Malcolm X, wrote a piece for Martin Luther King Jr., and his 1963 dirge \"Alabama\", a piece with a close tonal connection to A Love Supreme's \"Psalm\", was written to commemorate the four girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing that year. As the '60s wore on, politically conscious \"fire jazz\" grew in currency, much of it directly inspired by Coltrane's music, but during his life he never quite felt the need to connect his music to specific social currents, even as others drew inspiration from it in that context. Coltrane was seeking something broader, communing with God as he understood it.</p><p>For Coltrane, that spiritual journey led him to A Love Supreme, which became the base he'd explore from during his short time left on Earth. Coltrane occupies a unique position in jazz history. He was famous, especially in the jazz world, but he wasn't really a personality. He was not inclined toward interviews and he wasn't very good at them, preferring to let the music speak for itself. He didn't have the mystery of a Thelonious Monk, the tragic genius of a Charlie Parker, the cool comfort with celebrity or flamboyance of a Miles Davis, the combative verbal dexterity of Charles Mingus, the theoretical underpinnings of Ornette Coleman, the comfort with the mainstream of Louis Armstrong, or the symbolic stature of Duke Ellington. He led a quiet life, putting everything into his music.</p><p>His chaotic years mostly came when he was an unknown; by the time he was a major jazz figure, almost his entire life was music. If he wasn't on stage or in a recording studio, he was practicing or studying records. Seemingly every other story of an encounter with Coltrane in the 1960s involved him in a room with a saxophone in his hand, playing scales. In his mind, God had saved him, and he was going to give back. A Love Supreme was his expression of gratitude, a hopeful prayer for a better world.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>John Coltrane's week at the Village Vanguard in 1961 resulted in a total of 22 recorded versions of nine songs, all of which have been released in the four-CD box The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings. This 1998 single CD has the five performances that the great saxophonist had agreed to have released during his lifetime: three numbers from the original Live at the Village Vanguard LP (\"Spiritual,\" \"Softly as in a Morning Sunrise,\" and \"Chasin' the Trane\") and two songs that appeared on Impressions (the title cut and \"India\"). Although branded as \"anti-jazz\" by John S. Wilson (an attack that was seconded by Leonard Feather), the music is actually quite coherent and would even be thought of as moderately conservative today, particularly \"Spiritual\" and the boppish rendition of \"Softly.\" Coltrane does stretch out quite a bit on the raging \"Chasin' the Trane\" and \"Impressions,\" but compared to what he would be playing in 1965, this should not scare anyone away. Obviously this CD (which also has Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet on two songs, pianist McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman and/or Jimmy Garrison on bass, and drummer Elvin Jones) is primarily recommended to listeners not wanting to invest in the more complete box.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Scott Yanow</strong></p><hr/><p>Original album review</p><p>This set documents the four-night stand by John Coltrane (sax) and his quintet at the Village Vanguard in New York City, November 1 -- 5, 1961. Although these are not newly discovered tapes -- as the majority of the selections have turned up on no less than five separate releases -- their restoration is significant in assessing motifs in Coltrane's [read: multi-show] live appearances. Coltrane is accompanied by an all-star ensemble of Eric Dolphy (alto sax/bass clarinet), Garvin Bushell (oboe/contrabassoon), Ahmed Abdul-Malik (oud), McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass), Reggie Workman (bass), Elvin Jones (drums), and Roy Haynes (drums). Their presence is as equally vital as Coltrane's -- inspiring as well as informing the dimensions of improvisation. With the knowledge that the entire run was being documented to create some sort of retail document, Coltrane chose nine specific compositions to concentrate on. The choice of material likewise had a tremendous impact on the personnel of the band -- evidenced by Bushnell's contributions during \"Spiritual\" and Abdul-Malik's within the context of the extended \"India.\" Each set bears its own distinctive shading and emphasis. Parties wishing to hear the run in its entirety are encouraged to check out the multi-disc Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings (1997) as there are multiple takes of the same songs. This allows even the most unsophisticated jazz consumer the opportunity to note the difference in the various versions, while contrasting the player's widely diverse performance styles. The highly recommended box set also includes a nine-panel fold out poster, 48-page liner notes booklet -- with a complete discography for the included material -- and other ephemera, such as rarely published photographs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

The real problem, therefore, became deciding which pieces to leave off the compilation as opposed to which ones to include. For instance, \"Acknowledgement,\" the first movement from the landmark <em>A Love Supreme</em> is in tow, but taken out of context it feels secluded and unsupported, thereby relegating the rest of <em>A Love Supreme</em> (which is arguably even more spirited) inconsequential. There are certainly some beautiful works here: \"Song of Praise\" (an odd, but delightful choice), and \"Dear Lord\" typify this compilation -- in fact there's not a dud in the group. It's just not possible to capture or do justice to Trane's spiritually themed Impulse! output onto one disc. For the seasoned Coltrane fan this compilation will prove useless. For those beginning their journey into Coltrane's formidable catalog, <em>Spiritual</em> is a mediocre representation of some magnificent records.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jack Isles</strong></p>"

In the process, he would create one of the most influential bodies of work in jazz. Many of Coltrane's greatest recordings were long, and it's no easy task to create a single CD that reflects his creative range. However, this remarkably good selection manages to include several extended performances, while charting his work's moments of both profound meditative beauty and creative onslaught. On \"Giant Steps,\" Coltrane pressed the boundaries of chordal improvisation, creating a high-speed maze of harmonic extensions. In perhaps his most famous vehicle, he recrafted \"My Favorite Things\" in the image of Indian music, spinning scalar improvisations on his soprano saxophone over a repeating piano figure and the molten drums of Elvin Jones. \"Chasin' the Trane,\" from his great 1961 Village Vanguard recordings, uses simple blues to launch an extended solo that tests the tenor's expressive limits. \"Jupiter,\" a duet with drummer Rashied Ali recorded in the final months of Coltrane's life, finds the same intensity still burning within him, his tone compressed to a tight vibrato and his circular lines spinning in still fresh directions. Along the way are those serene islands that always marked Coltrane's work, some of the most beautiful and direct ballad and blues playing in jazz, from his own \"Naima\" to an ethereal version of \"In a Sentimental Mood\" with its composer, Duke Ellington, at the piano.</p> &mdash; <b>Stuart Broomer</b>"

But it's still a prototype; the best was yet to come.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jeff Tamarkin</strong></p><hr/><p>Already a seasoned music business veteran at the age of 22, Ry Cooder stepped out from behind the shadows of the likes of Jackie DeShannon, Taj Mahal, the Rolling Stones, and Captain Beefheart, signing his own deal with Warner Brothers records in 1969. Released the following year, Cooder's eponymous debut creates an intriguing fusion of blues, folk, rock & roll, and pop, filtered through his own intricate, syncopated guitar; Van Dyke Parks and Lenny Waronker's idiosyncratic production; and Parks and Kirby Johnson's string arrangements. And while he's still finding his feet as a singer, Cooder puts this unique blend across with a combination of terrific songs, virtuosic playing, and quirky, yet imaginative, arrangements. For material, Cooder, the son of folklorist parents, unearths ten gems -- spanning six decades dating back to the 1920s -- by legends such as Woody Guthrie, Blind Blake, Sleepy John Estes, and Leadbelly, as well as a current Randy Newman composition. Still, as great as his outside choices are, it's the exuberant charm of his own instrumental \"Available Space\" that nearly steals the show. Its joyful interplay between Cooder's slide, Van Dyke Parks' music hall piano, and the street-corner drumming creates a piece that is both loose and sophisticated. If \"Available Space\" is the record's most playful moment, its closer, \"Dark Is the Night,\" is the converse, with Cooder's stark, acoustic slide extracting every ounce of torment from Blind Willie Johnson's mournful masterpiece. Some of the eccentric arrangements may prove to be a bit much for both purists and pop audiences alike, but still, Cooder's need to stretch, tempered with a reverence for the past, helps to create a completely original work that should reward adventurous listeners.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

As was the case with his previous recordings, he not only looks to the masters -- including blues legend Sleepy John Estes, songwriter Dan Penn (both of whom appear here) and the great Skip James -- for material, but to lost and neglected pieces of American folk and blues, as well. Cooder adds the traditional title-track, which opens the album, and Lawrence Wilson's \"Crow Black Chicken,\" which dates back to the late 1920s, to this collection of discoveries -- both of which are handled with just the right balance of personality and reverence. Elsewhere, he injects a dark irony into the jingoistic \"Rally 'Round the Flag,\" with its slow, mournful piano (played by Randy Newman) and slide guitar, while the Joseph Spence-style guitar arrangement of the World War II standard \"Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer\" has a sense of hope and conviction. Often criticized for possessing a less than commanding voice, Cooder steps back from the microphone for four of the album's ten tracks -- three instrumentals and one featuring Sleepy John Estes on his own \"President Kennedy.\" And while all of the instrumentals presented here are fine renditions of great tunes, it's \"Dark End of the Street\" which truly stands out. Here, Cooder realizes that the only thing in his arsenal that can do justice to James Carr's definitive version is his own remorseful slide guitar. Without uttering a single lyric, he's able to convey the shame and deep regret of the Dan Penn/Chips Moman classic. Thanks to moments like this, along with Cooder's consistently strong choice of material and brilliant guitar work, Boomer's Story -- less eccentric than his first, and less eclectic than Into the Purple Valley -- ranks among his best work</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

To make things even more interesting, he also included three soul- and gospel-based backup singers in the lineup (two of whom had appeared on Chicken Skin Music). Recorded in December of 1976, over a span of two nights in San Francisco, Show Time documents these shows by Cooder and his \"Chicken Skin Revue.\" And while Cooder's guitar -- along with his usual eclectic assortment of songs -- is the star of the show, each of the principles has his chance to shine throughout the evening. Terry Evans, Bobby King, and Eldridge King's soulful rendition of \"The Dark End of the Street,\" as well as the lovely \"Volver, Volver,\" which features Jiminez, are a couple of the highlights. Cooder's selection of material here is as eclectic as ever, but Jiminez and the band stay with him every step of the way. They seem equally at home with the R&B of \"Smack Dab in the Middle\" as they do with the Jiminez instrumental \"Viva Seguin,\" which leads into a Tex-Mex reworking of Woody Guthrie's \"Do Re Mi.\" Still, as good as the fit may be between leader and band, it's the Negro spiritual, \"Jesus on the Mainline,\" stripped down to just four voices and Cooder's remarkable bottleneck, that's the real showstopper here. Cooder is not usually one to stray too far outside the confines of the song on record, but in this setting he gets a chance to really stretch. Like most live recordings, Show Time isn't necessarily essential, though there's enough to make it worthwhile for fans. Also, included is a terrific Dixieland take on Gary \"U.S.\" Bonds' \"School Is Out\" recorded with the same band in the studio.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Beginning with his self-titled debut in 1970, Ry Cooder's records seemed to be as much history lesson as they were entertainment. Not because Cooder was trying to club you over the head with this stuff; he simply gravitated to great songs, no matter what the era or genre. Released in 1978, Jazz seems to be his first conscious attempt at a concept album, in the historical sense. Here he pays homage to some of the early tunes and masters of jazz, ranging from the late 1800s through the \"coon songs\" of the early part of the next century, to the ragtime and \"Spanish\" music of Jelly Roll Morton, and the sophistication of cornetist Bix Beiderbecke. The only living artist (at the time of release) who's represented here is the great Bahamian guitarist Joseph Spence, who recorded from the '50s through the '80s, and whose syncopated style was extremely influential in Cooder's own development as a guitarist. Spence's sacred songs are presented here in string and brass band arrangements that emphasize the Caribbean connection between his music and Morton's habaniera pieces. The complexity of the material on Jazz, as well as the arrangements by Joseph Byrd, dictate that this is Cooder's most polished and orchestrated effort to date. Whereas in the past, even at their most removed, Cooder's records usually kept at least one foot in rock & roll or blues, Jazz can, at times, lack some of that fire and be almost bookish in its approach. Still, there is enough excitement in the music's intricacies and Cooder's beautiful, fluid playing to forgive the politeness of some of the performances. From the informative liner notes by Ry Cooder himself to the brilliant compositions, Jazz is, at the very least, educational. But, a little time spent with this music and you'll see why it was and continues to be relevant, as well as beloved.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

At the same time, he also continues the primarily electric sound of that record. As far as his selection of material goes, Borderline may sometimes lack the surprising, esoteric charm of his earlier recordings, but there are still some terrific finds, including the Tex-Mex-flavored \"The Girls from Texas,\" which may be the album's finest moment. Other highlights include one of John Hiatt's best, the written-to-order \"The Way We Make a Broken Heart,\" as well as Billy \"The Kid\" Emerson's \"Crazy 'Bout an Automobile,\" which Cooder had been performing live for a number of years, and the soulful Maurice & Mac treasure \"Why Don't You Try Me.\" And while it's moments like these that help make Cooder's records special, he also takes on some better-known '50s and '60s offerings with moderate success. His recording of Wilson Pickett's 1966 hit \"634-5789\" isn't going to make anyone forget the original, but he's able to pull it off as a rocker, while \"Speedo\" and \"Down in the Boondocks\" are respectable covers. Borderline may not have the singular personality of his best '70s work, but it's a solid outing nonetheless.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Brett Hartenbach</strong></p>"

The Border, composed and released in 1982, was the soundtrack to Tony Richardson's film The Border, and 1985's Alamo Bay was directed by Louis Malle. The interesting thing about these soundtracks is that they come immediately after Cooder's successful collaboration with Walter Hill on The Long Riders and Southern Comfort, and as the before-and-after bookends to his enigmatic score for Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. The score for The Border is perfectly balanced. Cooder's slide work is always touted, but also noteworthy is his ability to virtually disappear in the mix when collaborating with Flaco Jimenez, Freddy Fender, Jim Dickinson, Jim Keltner, and Sam \"The Sham\" Samudio. The haunting title track, \"Across the Borderline,\" sung by Fender, is among the most beautiful and literate cuts Cooder has ever written. The cantina music by Jimenez and Samudio is utterly evocative. Check the tunes with Samudio on vocals, such as \"Palomita\" and \"No Quiero,\" to get the laid-back, sun-up feel. Then there's John Hiatt. Hiatt was at the beginning of his association with Cooder. He helped to pen some of the better cuts on the set, including the aforementioned \"Across the Borderline\" and the bluesy garage rock jam \"Skin Game.\" His high-whine vocals are perfect for the tension between cultures and reflect the conflict of Jack Nicholson's character as a principled U.S. border guard. Alamo Bay, Malle's picture that pits American shrimpers against refugee Vietnamese on the south coast of Texas, is another study in contrasts. Once more, Cooder assembles an all-star band that includes Hiatt, Cesar Rosas, David Hidalgo, Lee Ving, Van Dyke Parks, David Lindley, Keltner, Chris Ethridge, David Mansfield, and Dickinson. The theme features Cooder's acoustic slide amidst strings (including Gayle Levant's harp), piano, and ambient sounds. The ethereal airy feel is swallowed whole by the raunchy electric roadhouse blues of \"Gooks on Main Street,\" and dislocated once more on the country ballad \"Too Close,\" performed by Hiatt with actress Amy Madigan, only to shift again with the sinister slide guitar and harmonica Eastern modal blues of \"Klan Meeting,\" an instrumental. The score weaves and wends through barroom shouters, panoramic instrumentals, ballads, Tex Mex, and conjunto. Placing both recordings on a single disc is a rare and exotic treat, and gives great insight into the complex yet visionary artist Cooder is, and just how his music is the perfect accompaniment to visuals yet stands completely on its own.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Listen to the groove on \"Which Came First,\" and try to keep your body from bobbing to the strong rhythm laid down by Jim Keltner, Tim Drummond, and the background vocalists. While we are on the subject of vocals, this is one of Ry Cooder's best efforts, and his backup vocalists are key here and deserve special recognition: Bobby King, John Hiatt, Willie Greene, and Herman Johnson for most of the CD. The two gems on this are the phenomenal treatments of both \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and Bob Dylan's \"I Need a Woman.\" Two songs as different in the original forms as pigs and gerbils are converted to R&B hit status. Both contain some memorable slide guitar work, but isn't that what we expect from this master of the guitar family. The album is very good but those two songs make it a gem.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bob Gottlieb</strong></p>"

		"review": "Suggestive of both the imagery of Wim Wenders' movie Paris, Texas and the desert itself, Ry Cooder's score is a peaceful, poetic journey into the soul of an acoustic guitar. \"Paris, Texas,\" \"Brothers,\" and \"Nothing Out There\" open the album as meditative blends of guitar twang and scratching ambient effects. The songs move at a pretty, slow place, and the opening track sees Cooder plucking his guitar's strings and letting that sound vibrate into thin air; it's a motif that he returns to repeatedly throughout the score. There's a bit of both humor and mystery to the stillness and the echoing, edgy sound effects that crop up. \"Cancion Mixteca\" includes a memorable turn on vocals by Harry Dean Stanton, singing in Spanish. \"No Safety Zone\" is almost completely ambient in its ethics, with fleeting experimental guitar playing, as the song works more as a mood-setter than a traditional song. \"I Knew These People\" begins with an extended segment of dialogue from the film before Cooder's somber guitar creeps in. The effect of the dialogue makes the track a fine, artistic statement, but the moment works better in the context of the movie than as a track on an album. The dialogue comes from a scene where the characters played by Stanton and Nastassja Kinski have a particularly emotional meeting. The majority of the score is delicate and stunningly pretty. The overall sense is that Cooder was reaching for spare, emotional movements. The score is stark, quiet, and as uplifting as it is sad. Cooder makes the music sound as modern and stylish as acoustic music can sound. The album is at once alien and organic. Since \"I Knew These People\" includes dialogue from Paris, Texas, the score works best for people who have seen the movie, but it's still a powerful and immensely evocative journey for those whose experience with the material is the album alone.<p>&mdash;<strong>Tim DiGravina</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>A Meeting by the River can best be described as a spontaneous outpouring of music, unhindered by convention or form, brought into being by musicians so supremely capable that the music is never labored, the technique of their craft always subservient to the final product. Cooder and Bhatt are genuine masters of the guitar and mohan vina, respectively. The latter, an instrument created by Bhatt himself, is a sort of hybrid between a guitar and a vichitra vina, and is played with a metal slide. This fact is just one of the many things that connect Bhatt's playing to Cooder's, who plays nothing but bottleneck guitar here. The musical interplay between Cooder and Bhatt is nothing short of astounding, especially so considering that they met for the first time only a half-hour before the recording of this album. The voices of the two instruments blend marvelously, first alternating melodic statements, then doing so together, each dancing around the other, playing cat and mouse, probing, answering, reflecting. They are ably accompanied by a pair of percussionists: tabla player Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari and Cooder's own son, Joachim, on dumbek. A Meeting by the River is one of those few cross-genre albums in which the listener never feels for a second that there is some kind of fusion going on; one does not hear the component parts so much as the integrated whole. However, one can theoretically separate guitar from vina, America from India, the Mississippi from the Ganges. Once this is done, the resulting music makes more sense than ever before, the combination of two traditions of stringed instruments that use slides to produce sound and value improvisation and voice-like phrasing. As good as this sounds on paper, the actual results are even more impressive. The splendor of the music is aided in its transmission by the fact that, like all Water Lily Acoustics releases, this album is masterfully recorded; each instrument is clear, distinct, and three-dimensional sounding. A Meeting by the River is a must-own, a thing of pure, unadulterated beauty, and the strongest record in Cooder's extensive catalog.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Daniel Gioffre</strong></p>"

While bandleader Desi Arnaz became a huge hit in the States, several equally talented musicians never saw success outside their native country, and have had nothing but their music to sustain them during the Castro reign. Ry Cooder went to Cuba to record a musical documentary of these performers. Many of the musicians on this album have been playing for more than a half century, and they sing and play with an obvious love for the material. Cooder could have recorded these songs without paying the musicians a cent; one can imagine them jumping up and grabbing for their instruments at the slightest opportunity, just to play. Most of the songs are a real treasure, traversing a lot of ground in Cuba's musical history. There's the opening tune, \"Chan Chan,\" a composition by 89-year-old Compay Segundo, who was a bandleader in the '50s; the cover of the early-'50s tune \"De Camino a la Verada,\" sung by the 72-year-old composer Ibrahim Ferrer, who interrupted his daily walk through Havana just long enough to record; or the amazing piano playing on \"Pablo Nuevo\" by 77-year-old Rubén González, who has a unique style that blends jazz, mambo, and a certain amount of playfulness. All of these songs were recorded live -- some of them in the musicians' small apartments -- and the sound is incredibly deep and rich, something that would have been lost in digital recording and overdubbing. Cooder brought just the right amount of reverence to this material, and it shows in his production, playing, and detailed liner notes. If you get one album of Cuban music, this should be the one.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve McMullen</strong></p>"

In addition, it is a concept album; but don't be afraid. It documents in mythical style the disappeared Los Angeles neighborhood of Chavez Ravine, a Mexican-American district that fought over by real etate developers, urban planning activists and city government. It was bulldozed in a sleazy deal was cut and it was razed order to erect a stadium that woiuld lure Walter O'Malley's Brooklyn Dodgers to L.A. Cooder's work has almost always concerned itself with what has been left out, marginalized, or relegated to the place of memory; it was inspired by a book of black-and-white photographs of the area by Don Normark. Over the course of its 15 songs Cooder poignantly, yet warmly, sets out to portray the flavor of the place, times, culture, chaos, and corruption of post-war Los Angeles. Here UFOs, the Red Scare, the Pachuco Scare, boxers, cops, hipster \"cool cats,\" ordinary folks, race politics, class war, the radio, J. Edgar Hoover, baseball, and of course musicians, slip in and out of this steamy, dreamy, seamless mix that evokes an emotional palette rich and complex. The tunes range from boxy corridos, Latin swing numbers, guaraches, Afro-Cuban sons, smoky polkas, moody atmospheric pieces, riotous good-time Pachuco boogie, rootsy rock, Costa Rican folk songs, and R&B tunes.</p> <p>Heroes and villains come and go in this panorama, all winding around in the little neighborhood where people hang out, sing, dance, make love, struggle and sweat for a better life in the American Dream. Sung in Spanish and English, Cooder sought out musicians from the era and the place, including the late Pachuco boogie boss Don Tosti, the late legendary Lalo Guerrero (the guiding force and spirit of the album who also passed away after contributing), Ersi Arvizu, and Little Willie G., all of whom appear with Joachim Cooder, Juliette & Carla Commagere, Jim Keltner, Flaco Jimenez, Mike Elizondo, Gil Bernal, Ledward Kaapana, Joe Rotunde, Rosella Arvizu, and others. \"Poor Man's Shangri-La,\" is a finger-popping rhumba where the extraterrestrial Space Vato beams down in a UFO to check out the 'hood to the sounds of Little Julian Herrera on the radio. Little Willie G. and the Commagere Sisters offer the lilting \"Onda Calljera,\" a folk song documenting a war between locally stationed military and pachucos. Chavez Ravine is an intricately woven web of covers including \"3 Cool Cats,\" by Leiber & Stoller, Guerrero's \"Corrido de Boxeo\" and \"Barrio Viejo,\" and originals like the cinematic \"Don't Call Me Red\" (where the taped voices of Frank Wilkinson, Jack Webb, and Raymond Burr all dialogue intensely about the FBI and communist activities) and \"3rd Base, Dodger Stadium,\" sung by longtime Cooder mate James Bla Pahinui -- who plays the part of a stadium car parker whose home was covered over by the hot corner in the ballpark. Chavez Ravine is sad and beautiful, funny, quirky and funky; it's got dirt under its nails and keeps listeners engaged from the jump with history and its colorful ghosts. Cooder sends it all off with solace, and perhaps with some hope, in a version of \"Soy Luz y Sombra,\" a gorgeous a cappella Costa Rican folk tune with original music. Chavez Ravine is easily the most ambitious thing in Cooder's catalog, and it just may be the grand opus of his career.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, issued between two national election cycles, is the most overtly political album Ry Cooder has ever released, and one of his funniest, most musically compelling ones, too. Cooder looks deeply into his musical past using his entire Americana musical arsenal: blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country here. Opener \"No Banker Left Behind\" updates Civil War-era marching music. Cooder's guitar, banjo, bass, and mandola lead drummer (and son) Joachim through a scathing indictment of the the financial bailout in 2007. The marching rhythms are punched through with sharp banjo and mandola riffs as Cooder's signature electric guitar sound frames them. \"El Corrido Jesse James\" has the outlaw speaking from heaven in waltz time. Accompanied by Flaco Jimenez's accordion and a horn section, James claims that while he was a bank robber, he never \"turned a family from their house,\" and asks God for his trusty .44 to \"put that bonus money back where it belongs.\" \"Quick Sand\" is a shuffling electric rocker that addresses the plight of illegal immigrants crossing into Arizona. \"Christmas Time This Year\" is the most incendiary anti-war song in a decade, presented innocently as a Mexican polka. \"Lord Tell Me Why\" borrows production techniques from Tom Waits, with co-writer and drummer Jim Keltner who assists in getting across this biting, ironic gospel tune: \"Lord tell me why a white man/Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more....\" An 11-piece band assists in \"I Want My Crown,\" a scorching, growling blues with Cooder's nasty guitar leading the charge. It's followed by the album's finest moment, \"John Lee Hooker for President,\" where Cooder does a shockingly accurate impression of the late bluesman, in fine boogie mode, paying a visit to the White House, not liking what he sees, and deciding to run for office: \"I'm compastatic. I ain't Republican or Democratic.\" He names Jimmy Reed as Veep and Johnny Taylor Secretary of State. His campaign promises swift retribution for injustice and a \"groove time\" for the nation. If only. The depth of Cooder's rage is quieter but more direct as the album draws to a close. In \"If There Is a God,\" God's been driven from heaven by redistricting; he, \"Jesus, Mary and Joe\" all hit the road for Mexico. God goes so far as to say he thinks the \"Republiklan\" legislature wants to bring back Jim Crow laws. Cooder's sorrow about the environment is pervasive in the final corrido, though he, like the Buddha, leaves room for tolerance, wishing his enemies \"No Hard Feelings.\" Those who've followed Cooder from the beginning will find much to love on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down. Those music fans unfamiliar with his work but looking for a comrade in arms will find one here. That said, this is revolution music; worthy of dancing to, learning from, and singing along with: who says topical music has to be boring?</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Ahhh, if I only had a Latin Grammy for every time some hot air-bloated rock pundit wrote that Bob Dylan's \"still got it,\" that Bruce Springsteen's late-90's social posturing is any more convincing than his Reagan-era material, that the small army of background singers and synthesizers required to create Brian Wilson's Imagination really sound any fresher than, say, \"Kokomo.\"</p><p>For the last seven or eight years, Elvis Costello fans have had great reason for concern. After a stellar showing with the reunited Attractions on 1994's Brutal Youth, Costello released a trio of disappointing releases. 1996's All This Useless Beauty barely used the Attractions, wandering in several different directions at once and recycling material originally written for other artists.  1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration Painted from Memory seemingly aged Costello an extra twenty years, with its preponderance of crooning ballads and arrangements that might as well have been recorded for a Dionne     Warwick comeback.  And last year's pairing with Anne Sofie von Otter, For the Stars, barely qualified as a Costello release at all, with a predilection for Costello's iffiest material (\"Shamed into Love,\" anyone?) and a pair of Tom Waits' more forgettable castoffs. When I Was Cruel, happily, finds Costello tuning his compass with two     excellent reference points: his 1986 masterwork Blood and Chocolate and the eclectic showmanship of 1989's Spike. Once again, Costello drafts Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas into the fold, but with a breath of fresh air in the form of Cracker's Davey Faragher on bass.  Costello harnesses some of his Useless Beauty period's greatest strengths-- the wet percussion from Tricky's remix of \"Little Atoms,\" for instance, and the tremolo guitar that dominated \"Complicated Shadows\"-- to give his new compositions a contemporary edge while anchoring the music to the ragged, rough-edged guitar sound that's been the signature of Costello's best work.</p><p>The result is an immediately engrossing and challenging collection of moody, evocative songs-- an entire album of \"I Want You\" and \"Watching the Detectives\" for those so inclined.  The cinematic noir of \"When I Was Cruel No. 2,\" with its point-of-view narration and looped female vocal, plays like the torch song from some as-yet unmade David Lynch film-- Twin Peaks meets Portishead in a smoky Italian nightclub. The faux-Beat rhythms of \"Dust\" and outright scat on the jazz-damaged \"Episode of Blonde\" succeed both as prose and dramatic     bits of music, easily upstaging Tom Waits' hit-and-miss homages to Kerouac and Ginsberg.</p><p>The balls-out rock textures of Blood and Chocolate are re-explored on \"Tear Off Your Own Head (It's a Doll Revolution),\" with its thick guitar hooks and powerful blasts of cleverly flanged bass, and \"My Blue Window,\" a cheeky nod to Blood and Chocolate's \"Blue Chair.\"  The guitar-driven \"Daddy Can I Turn This\" and the meaty, dissonant \"Dissolve\" are Costello-by-the-numbers, tightly wound pop gems that seem to spring painlessly from Costello's loins when he's on a roll.          But it's the more experimental pieces on When I Was Cruel that are the     most consistently rewarding.  The percolating rhythms and locomotive bass on \"Spooky Girlfriend,\" augmented by horns and tight background harmonies, almost sound like Costello backed by Oranges and Lemons-era XTC.  Likewise with the complicated pastiche of programmed beats, organ and horns on \"15 Petals,\" a confident and infectious detour into Latin rhythms (think Tito Puente, not Ricky Martin).  The measured swells of backwards guitar and deep bass hits on closer \"Radio Silence\" send When I Was Cruel out on an optimistic note-- for the future of music and for Costello's own relevance in the post-modern blipscape of Kid A and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.</p><p>Perhaps When I Was Cruel's sweetest punch is that, at 47, Costello sounds pretty much exactly as he did at 27.  Unlike Dylan, Springsteen, Wilson, or Waits-- or, god knows, Lou Reed-- he hasn't had to compromise his music to fit his aging pipes. Costello's at his most entertaining when he cleverly sidesteps an issue rather than confronting it head on, as on the slight misfire of \"45\", which makes the trite connection between Costello's age and the number of     revolutions per minute made by a hit record.</p><p>Faragher's hyperactive bass proves a savvy addition to Nieve's blasting organ and noodling piano, Thomas' busy rhythms, and Costello's spy-film guitar riffs. Some of Costello's most interesting work has been fatally injured by poor chemistry; When I Was Cruel is a self-confident return to form-- sharp, solid and, though Costello should have nothing to prove-- completely relevant.<hr/></p><p>&mdash; <strong>Will Bryant, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This compilation of 22 Cream BBC tracks from 1966-1968 marked a major addition to the group's discography, particularly as they released relatively little product during their actual lifetime. All of but two of these cuts (\"Lawdy Mama\" and the 1968 version of \"Steppin' Out,\" which had appeared on Eric Clapton's <i>Crossroads</i> box) were previously unreleased, and although many of these had made the round on bootlegs, the sound and presentation here is unsurprisingly preferable. As for actual surprises, there aren't many. It's a good cross section of songs from their studio records, though a couple, \"Steppin' Out\" and \"Traintime,\" only appeared on live releases, and some of these BBC takes actually predate the release and recording of the album versions, which makes them of historical interest for intense Cream fans. (There are also four brief interviews with Eric Clapton from the original broadcasts.) There's a mild surprise in the absence of a version of \"White Room,\" but otherwise many of the group's better compositions and covers are here, including \"I Feel Free,\" \"N.S.U.,\" \"Strange Brew,\" \"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\" \"Sunshine of Your Love,\" \"Born Under a Bad Sign,\" \"Outside Woman Blues,\" \"Crossroads,\" \"We're Going Wrong,\" \"I'm So Glad,\" \"SWLABR,\" and \"Politician.\"</p><p>Cream took better advantage of the live-in-the-studio BBC format than some groups of similar stature. There's a lean urgency to most of the performances that, while not necessarily superior to the more fully realized and polished studio renditions, do vary notably in ambience from the more familiar versions. The sound quality is good but not perfect, and variable; sometimes it's excellent, yet at other times there seem to be imperfections in the tapes sourced, with \"Sunshine of Your Love\" suffering from a (not grievously) hollow, muffled quality. If there's any other slight criticism of this set, it's that a handful of BBC tracks don't appear, including some that don't make it onto this CD in any version, like \"Sleepy Time Time,\" \"Toad,\" and \"Sitting on Top of the World.\" Given Cream's tendency to over-improvise on the band's live concert recordings, however, the concise nature of these BBC tracks (none of which exceed five minutes) makes them preferable listening in some respects.</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

		"review": "<p>For one reason or another, Cream reunited in the spring of 2005, setting aside nearly 40 years of acrimony for a series of gigs at the Royal Albert Hall in May, which was later followed by a few shows at Madison Square Garden about a month after souvenirs of the London shows -- a double-CD set and a double DVD set -- were released. By that time, tickets for the New York concerts were long gone, which was understandable, since Cream had not only remained a legendary band, but it seemed extremely unlikely that they would ever play live again, so the chance to see the original power trio in the flesh was tempting. Fans that anxiously awaited this reunion might find the record of the event, bearing the unweildy title Royal Albert Hall: London 2-3-5-6 05, a bit anticlimatic, or a mixed blessing at the very least. The chemistry between guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton, bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker is still palpable on this compilation of highlights from the four Royal Albert Hall shows -- it's just quite a bit more subdued than it was the last time they played together which, discounting a one-off reunion at their 1993 induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, was 36 years ago.</p> <p>That's a long time ago and the group are no longer restless young psychedelic bluesmen-- at time of the concerts Eric Clapton had just turned 60, Jack Bruce was a couple weeks shy of his 62nd birthday, Ginger Baker was 65. Of course, they're hardly the only group of '60s veterans that have remained active -- the Rolling Stones released a new album of material a month before this live album, and they're all in their '60s, but there's a big difference between the two bands, and that's that the Stones kept playing together throughout the past four decades. While all three members of Cream remained relatively active (Baker recently had retired to his ranch, but kept playing professionally into the '90s, even teaming up with Bruce on occasion), they never played a unit, so they're a little rusty in terms of inter-band relations, which winds up making them sound their age.</p><p>Not only do they never rock as hard as the Stones do on A Bigger Bang, but Cream never approximates the furious rush of energy that the band did at their prime and there's never a sense of the push-and-pull dynamics between the three members that made the best of their lengthy jams sound alive and at times unpredictable. Part of this is down to age, not just in the sense that they're a little bit older and a little bit slower, but because those four decades have changed their style a little. Baker is a tighter drummer, lacking the reckless, volatile energy that wound up either as thrilling or turgid. Bruce can't hit the high notes anymore, doesn't roam as much on the bass, but he still manages to dominate with his fluid instrumental and vocal phrasing; plus, his bass just sounds enormous, as if it could conquer the earth. Clapton plays like a millionaire with impeccable taste yet in this stripped down setting, he's forced to play more than he has in years; at times, he's too refined and relies on familiar licks -- plus, his reliance on a Strat over the Gibsons that fueled his Cream sound does give this a noticeable lack of heft, even if he gets a good approximation of his classic warm tone -- but there are times, like when he holds a single note longer than Neil Young on \"Cinammon Girl,\" that he takes greater risks than he has in years. So, this winds up not necessarily exciting, but it's far from embarassing, either, and there's a certain sense of admiration in hearing the trio pull it together for a respectable performance. In no way does this replace the group's original studio albums -- or the excellent BBC Sessions or even the patchwork live albums they released just after their breakup -- but this does act as a nice coda to their brief career.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Instead, Finn digs into the depths of his emotional psyche with obsessive detail, crafting a set of intense, personal songs that range from the all-too-intimate look at infidelity of \"Into Temptation,\" to the raucous exorcism of \"Kill Eye.\" Through all of this introspective soul-searching, Finn reveals most of all his true mastery of melody.</p>— <b>Chris Woodstra</b>"

For nearly 30 years, his work has channelled a restless creative spirit through one of Australia’s most acclaimed and distinctive voices.</p><p><i>CLOSE-UPS</i> is a surprisingly affectionate return to his back catalogue in a spontaneous acoustic setting. By recalling songs he hasn’t played in 25 years and reconsidering some of his finest moments as a solo artist, Stephen Cummings has arguably arrived at his definitive album.</p><p>“To me it was about rearranging and reclaiming the songs,” he says. “A good pop song doesn’t date.

It has that urgency so many records seem to lack these days.”</p><p><i>CLOSE-UPS</i> was recorded at Joe Camilleri’s Woodstock Studios in Melbourne with long time collaborators Shane O’Mara on guitars and Rebecca Barnard on harmony vocals, plus Howard Cairns (bass), Peter Jones (drums) and James Black (electric piano).</p>"

Darling and Bjornstad were reunited in the subsequent album Epigraphs, although I don't think it quite captures the magic of this effort. They are also heard in the soundtrack to Jean-Luc Godard's film \"Forever Mozart\". After working on the earlier album \"The Sea\", Bjornstad wrote about the processes that lead to \"The River\": \"I spent the winter of 1994/5 researching and playing music of the late renaissance, paying particular attention to the clarity of William Byrd's and Orlando Gibbons's melodic invention, trying to 'translate' some of this into a modern idiom, trying to find a contemporary language for further dialogues.\"</p><p>This album deserves to share the higher profile of other ECM artists like Jan Garbarek & the Hilliard Ensemble. See also the soundtrack music of Eleni Karaindrou (Music for Films, Ulysses Gaze,...) for other richly textured marvels in the ECM roster.</p>&mdash; <b>Michael G. Williams</b>     <br><br><hr><br><p>Ketil Bjornstad comes from Norway and on this, his third release on the ECM label, teams up with American cello player David Darling again. David Darling had of course made an appearance on a previous release entitled The Sea. Darling is without doubt one of the more influential players on the scene today lending tremendous imagination and color and tonality to whatever he puts his bow to. He started originally with Paul Winter, in the same line up as Ralph Towner and Collin Walcott who would later form the band Oregon. Darling of course would in later years make a name for himself with the album EOS which he recorded with Terje Rypdal, consisting of screaming improvised guitar and cello duets. Classical meets Norwegian rock, further enhancing ECM's name and reputation, not to mention their own .Ketil Bjornstad is more of a classical player than a jazz figure. His background is with the Oslo Philharmonic. Born in 1952, KB is these days a leading arts figure in Norway, not only a respected pianist but also a writer of sorts.</p><p>The River contains twelve duets between the two players. It's fairly slow music and continues KB's fascination with aquatic themes, which started with Water Stories, featuring Terje Rypdal and Bjorn Kjellemyr from The Chasers, as well as drummer Jon Christensen and leading on to 1995's release The Sea, featuring the same line up. This is more introspective and is contemplative in feel. This is a fine combination that works well together. This is very refined music from two leading classical figures who are not afraid to cross over. For myself, I am very drawn to the dark textures that David Darling is able to produce and if you are aware of his previous releases like Darkwood then this might appeal.</p>"

Although the group appeals to the same audience as Blues Traveler, Hootie & the Blowfish, and the Spin Doctors, the Dave Matthews Band has more influences than their peers. Fusing together folk-rock, worldbeat, jazz, and pop, the band is arguably the most musically adept of all their contemporaries. However, they have trouble coming up with engaging hooks, as their third album, Crash, proves. Although the band continues to get better -- their musical cross-breeding is effortless and seamless -- they often don't have an attractive frame for their skills. Strangely, the lack of memorable melodies doesn't particularly hurt the album -- it actually emphasizes the band's instrumental talents. Nevertheless, since there's a lack of strong pop hooks, Crash is an album that will please fans, but not novices.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Bootleggers had discovered that certain bands had voracious audiences who would listen to anything by the group. Once Dave Matthews discovered he had one of those bands and that he had scores of unofficial discs on the market, he decided to release official live albums on a regular basis. A good business decision, but it has the effect of diluting his discography somewhat, especially when the end result is as ordinary as Listener Supported. Unlike audience tapes and bootlegged shows -- which, in an ideal world, capture a band loose and unaware -- the concert on Listener Supported was recorded for a PBS television show, In the Spotlight. This may have affected their performance somewhat, since there just isn't much energy to the recording. Part of the problem is that DMB don't really explore new musical territory through improvisations -- they just settle into a groove and ride it. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it does mean that there's not as much identity to an individual DMB show as there is in, say, a Phish show. When the band nails the groove live, they can be more engaging than they are on record. But if they just float on by, as they do on Listener Supported, the songs and jams are flatter and never really go anywhere. If you're already a fan -- a very devoted fan -- that's fine, but otherwise, listening to these two discs nonstop will be a little dull. DMB are capable of more than this; Listener Supported just captures them on an off night.</b>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

It wasn't that studio outtakes were suddenly available -- it was that it was easier than ever to record, press, and distribute live concerts. Rock bands who jammed, whether they were hard rockers like Pearl Jam or noodlers like Phish, were in particular demand since, as the adage goes, no two shows were exactly alike. Given this insatiable appetite for new live records, it's a wonder that more artists didn't make like Dave Matthews and launch a series of official releases of notable live shows. It especially makes sense in Matthews' case, since his band sounds better and is more adventurous in a live setting than it is in the studio, as the first installment, Live at Red Rocks, illustrated. Its follow-up, Live at Luther College, takes a different tactic. Instead of featuring the band, it's Matthews alone acoustically, supported by his friend, session guitarist Tim Reynolds. The double-disc album was culled from the duo's 1996 tour, and not surprisingly, the bulk of the material focuses on Matthews' first two albums for RCA. What is surprising is that the songs arguably sound better in this setting, since all of the group improvisations are stripped away, leaving the songs to speak for themselves. Accordingly, Matthews isn't nearly as eccentric in his vocal tics, letting the music flow simply and engagingly. The results are quite entertaining, and even if the album was intended just for fans, it's the rare specialty item that could win new listeners.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Often, their records hinted at the eclecticism and adventure inherent in those improvisation, but Before These Crowded Streets is the first album to fully capture that adventurous spirit. Not coincidentally, it's their least accessible record, even if it's more of a consolidation than it is a step forward. Early Dave Matthews albums were devoted to the worldbeat fusions of Graceland and Sting, but his RCA efforts incorporated these influences into a smoother, pop-oriented style. Here, everything hangs out. Old trademarks, like jittery acoustic grooves and jazzy chords, are here, augmented by complex polyrhythms, Mideastern dirges, and on two tracks, the slashing strings of the Kronos Quartet. Some fans may find the new, darker textures a little disarming at first, but they're a logical extension of the group's work, and in many ways, this sonic daring results in the most rewarding album they've yet recorded. The Dave Matthews Band haven't completely vanquished their demons, however -- songwriting remains a problem, especially since relying on grooves, improvisation, and texture allows them to skimp on melody, and Matthews' lyrics can be awkward and embarrassing, especially if he's writing about sex. Still, these are minor flaws on an album that relies on tone and improvisation, both of which are in ample supply on Before These Crowded Streets.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>The fourth proper studio album by the Dave Matthews Band had a rough birth, as the group jettisoned a set of sessions recorded with their longtime producer Steve Lillywhite, starting afresh with Glen Ballard, the mastermind behind Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. Ballard has a tremendous influence on the resulting record, collaborating with Matthews on every track and changing the direction of their sound. To a certain extent, the change is welcome, since <i>Before These Crowded Streets</i> suggested that the group was running out of steam, but the sudden shift toward measured maturation and slickness is jarring all the same, since it emphasizes Matthews' melodies and leadership over the group interplay that is the group's calling card. It's not that the music is now simplistic, since there are still some tricky rhythms and shifts in tone, but the group doesn't have much room to stretch in Ballard's precise arrangements. In a sense, they sort of benefit from this increased focus, since the group's instrumental excursions can be a little flabby, but it still robs them of much of their character. Also, <i>Everyday</i> sounds like it was the product of a difficult birth, and wouldn't have gelled if Ballard hadn't been involved, pushing Matthews toward completion. It does result in a record that's more cohesive than its predecessor, but it's far less engagingly loose-limbed than DMB at its peak. Perhaps that's just a byproduct of maturation, but Everyday feels like forced maturation, a record that suppresses the group's best attributes in favor of a moderate, self-consciously classy stab at adult pop. That it works pretty well at that level is a testament to Ballard's skills, but it feels more like a weirdly abortive solo project by Matthews than a full-fledged DMB effort.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Every review, every article surrounding the release of Everyday mentioned it, often claiming it was better than the released project — an opinion the band seemed to support by playing many numbers from the widely bootlegged lost album on tour in 2001. Since they couldn't run away from the Lillywhite Sessions, they decided to embrace it, albeit on their own terms. They didn't just release the album, as is. They picked nine of the best songs from the sessions, reworked some of them a bit, tinkered with the lyrics, re-recorded the tunes with a different producer (Stephen Harris, a veteran of post-Brit-pop bands like the Bluetones, plus engineer on U2's <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i>), added two new songs, and came up with <i>Busted Stuff</i>, a polished commercial spin on music widely considered the darkest, most revealing work Matthews has yet created. Remarkably, these songs not only retain their emotional core even after they've been cleaned up, but they perhaps even gain more resonance in this setting. After all, Steve Lillywhite is hardly Steve Albini, and while the initial versions of these songs were raw, it was as much because they were not quite finished as they were Matthews exposing his soul. Here, these songs have been completed, not just in the writing but in the arrangement and production, so they sound just as personal to Dave Matthews, but also sound like fully realized DMB songs. And while they do jam a bit — in, surprise!, a song called \"Kit Kat Jam\" — that's not the emphasis of their performances; in these slow, moody pieces, they provide supple support to Matthews' elliptical, winding melodies and searching lyrics. The band sounds unified, and so does the album; one of the new songs, \"Where Are You Going,\" sounded dull on its first appearance on the <i>Mr. Deeds</i> soundtrack, but here, it's part of the fabric of the album, equally effective in sustaining the reflective, not depressive, tone of the album. Here, there's none of the loose-limbed, frat-boy funk from DMB's previous albums, none of the smirking jokiness that has plagued their up-tempo jams, while the heartache and yearning that once seemed affected in their ballads is palpably real. It's not so much a departure as it is an unexpected twist in their career. By leaving behind the key elements that defined their music, DMB has revealed that they can hit a deeper emotional chord and, in the process, deliver what's unquestionably the best album of their career.</p>&mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

The Gorge, recorded over three nights in 2002, is easily Matthews' finest officially released live outing, even if you can get the entire run in a six-disc set for a very reasonable price through the band's website. This baby just whets the appetite. But does it ever. Matthews and company lay out 14 tracks, many of them less obvious choices than on previous outings. The music here comes from Before These Crowded Streets (a beautiful opening medley of \"Pantala Naga Pampa\" and \"Rapunzel\"; \"Ants Marching\" doesn't appear on the CDs at all, just the DVD footage!), \"The Song Jane Likes\" from Remember Two Things, and tracks from Busted Stuff, Crash, Everyday, and even Some Devil. The jams are tighter and rowdier; there's less hippie stuff and more honest to goodness musicianship and groove. And the version of \"Gravedigger\" here is as moving as it is on the studio outing. The singalong at the beginning of \"Everyday,\" featured in a medley with \"No. 36,\" is quite beautiful, not annoying like some similar moments on live records are. The more song-oriented first disc juxtaposes nicely with the more jam-oriented second, which features a smoking version of \"Kit Kat Jam\" and \"Lie in Our Graves.\" The DVD showcases not only concert footage, but the \"Grace Is Gone\" music video and a documentary on the making of it, as well as an intimate look at the Gorge itself, a piece of environmental architecture that is an astonishing music venue and makes Red Rocks look paltry in comparison. Fans will have to have it, to be sure, but this might serve to turn others on to that particular brand of Matthews magic as well.

This one is three CDs, loaded with hits and near-misses, from one of the most successful stage bands in the business. The Matthews Band is tight, full of enough funk and sass to keep it interesting, and yet is able to convey real emotion to tens of thousands of people, as evidenced by their many live recordings. What sets this one apart is its presentation of one concert in its entirety, and its willingness to leave rough edges in. While the sound is pristine, and the performance reflects the band's well-rehearsed acumen, there are those spontaneous moments on this set that get left off of most band's live recordings -- including Matthews' previous ones.</p><p>In addition, this one rocks harder, and is more visceral, than his other offerings of this type. There are 20 tracks spread over this triple-disc, and without doubt, many of the same tracks that have been issued now nearly countless times are here as well: \"Ants Marching,\" \"Dancing Nancies,\" \"All Along the Watchtower,\" (this one shouldn't be issued again until they can read it as dynamically as they did with steel guitar boss Robert Randolph). There is also a guest appearance by Gov't Mule's and the Allman Brothers' Warren Haynes on Disc Three, for a smoking cover of Neil Young's \"Cortez the Killer,\" and a band jam called \"Jimi Thing.\" If you are a fan of Matthews' idiosyncratic rock, this will definitely be a welcome addition to your shelf -- though it's worth speculating that you have tons of bootlegs already.

		"review": "<p>For those just joining the cult surrounding the Dave Matthews Band, The Best of What's Around, Vol. 1 is actually a stellar introduction. There are two discs in the package, one compiled from the group's studio offerings and a live disc of previously unreleased material (at least \"officially\" unreleased). But then, this set is unique in another way also: the tracks were selected by DMB fans via the band's website. This is the way best-of and compilation recordings should be issued &mdash; by fans, not the suits upstairs. The studio disc contains two cuts from each RCA-issued album, from Under the Table and Dreaming straight through to Stand Up. To everyone's credit, there are two picks from Busted Stuff, a record that was undeserving of the ire it received from some members of the music press. Beginning at the beginning: \"What Would You Say\" and \"Crash into Me\" are obvious picks. (The latter is a track well deserving of its smash success, and one of those songs listeners will be hearing in whatever form radio goes for a very long time.) A thoroughly modern love song, its simple melody, hook, and chorus are memorable from the first time through. Other standouts from the first disc include \"Crush,\" \"Grey Street,\" \"Grace Is Gone,\" and \"Hunger for the Great Light.\" The live platter is wonderfully assembled, jumping back and forth across time from 2000 to 2006. All but one of the selections were recorded in the States, and the performances are stellar — even the version of \"Ants Marching,\" the most over-recorded song in DMB history and one listeners should all get a break from, is wonderfully refreshing here. There are a couple of tracks with guest performances: \"Everyday\" with the great Vusi Mahlasela on vocals, and a scorching read of \"Louisiana Bayou\" with the inimitable Robert Randolph on pedal steel (if you've never heard Randolph, get ready for a mind-blowing treat). Those uninitiated who are wondering what all the fuss has been about for the past decade get a real opportunity here to check out the very best of what's been recorded, and get a small taste of the band live as well. Longtime fans who don't already have the shows referenced here will want to pick it up for the live set alone.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<P>In some ways, two and a half hours of acoustic Dave Matthews with Tim Reynolds seems like it would be a snore — especially since a boatload of these 27 songs range between five and nine minutes! The Dave Matthews Band can get away with such excesses as a group, but in this intimate setting on such a large stage? It's either truly wonderful or something of an exercise in intense ego run riot, right? To be fair, this is not a snore. Reynolds is a hell of a guitarist. He is not one given to random excess and never pretends to be a guitar hero — though he is. The program is simply that this pair brings out Matthews' tunes from both the DMB and his solo recording and plays them for an audience full of adoration and gratitude. And, for the most part, it works. The opening blues moans that introduce \"Bartender\" let the listener know that this is no ordinary acoustic show. Renditions of \"Crush,\" \"Gravedigger,\" \"Some Devil,\" and \"Crash into Me\" are gorgeously done here. There is a conviction in Matthews' voice that is missing on a lot of the band's live records. Likewise, \"Grace Is Gone\" and the cover versions like Neil Young's \"Down by the River,\" Daniel Lanois' \"The Maker,\" and Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" are also wonderfully done. There is also a new song called \"Sister\" that Matthews overly explains, but the song's terrific.</P><P>There are a few dull moments, but over the entire course of this set they are actually few and far between — unless Matthews' voice gets to you after a while, and then perhaps you're in trouble. When Matthews is lazy (and he often is), the results can be samey sounding — but he's not here. He understands implicitly that his singing is more important than it is with the DMB, and it needs to carry the weight. Reynolds adds so much in terms of color and texture — whether he's playing straight, using effects, playing slide, or inventing some new scale to play a solo in, he transforms what might be merely intimate and engaging into something (mostly) compelling. Even the nine-plus-minute \"Dancing Nancies\" works like a charm because Reynolds is able to create an alternate voice with his lead guitar playing. His solo on Young's \"Down by the River\" actually mimics (on acoustic guitar) the songwriter's, by going into a somewhat extended single-note hammer until it becomes trancelike — he could just as easily have shown off. For Matthews fans, this is essential. For those on the fence about Matthews, this is document enough to win you over to his talent as a songwriter — without spending the fruitless time that DMB recordings take up. For those who liked Some Devil, his solo effort, this document will provide further enjoyment. It's as solid as an extended presentation can be and is, for the most part, thoroughly enjoyable. The great contribution it does provide is to demonstrate what a guitar-picking wonder Reynolds is, even more so than on earlier collaborations between these two. Somebody should sign this guy up, and quick.</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

A primary consideration of these fruitful sessions is the caliber of musicians -- Miles Davis (trumpet), Red Garland (piano), John Coltrane (tenor sax), and Philly Joe Jones (drums) -- who were basically doing their stage act in the studio. As actively performing musicians, the material they are most intimate with would be their live repertoire. Likewise, what more obvious place than a studio is there to capture every inescapable audible nuance of the combo's musical group mind. The end results are consistently astonishing. At the center of Steamin', as with most outings by this band, are the group improvisations which consist of solo upon solo of arguably the sweetest and otherwise most swinging interactions known to have existed between musicians. \"Surrey With the Fringe on Top\" is passed between the mates like an old joke. Garland compliments threads started by Davis and Coltrane as their seamless interaction yields a stream of strikingly lyrical passages. There are two well-placed nods to fellow bop pioneers Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on a revision of their \"Salt Peanuts.\" Philly Joe Jones' mimicking cymbal speak -- which replicates Gillespie's original vocals -- is nothing short of genius. This rendition is definitely as crazy and unpredictable here as the original. Thelonious Monk also gets kudos on \"Well, You Needn't.\" This quintet makes short work of the intricacies of the arrangement, adding the double horn lead on the choruses and ultimately redefining this jazz standard. Although there is no original material on Steamin', it may best represent the ability of the Miles Davis quintet to take standards and rebuild them to suit their qualifications.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

Like its predecessors Cookin' and Relaxin', Workin' is the product of not one -- as mythology would claim -- but two massively productive recording sessions in May and October of 1956, respectively. Contradicting the standard methodology of preparing fresh material for upcoming albums, Davis and company used their far more intimate knowledge of the tunes the quintet was performing live to inform their studio recordings. As was often the case with Davis, the antithesis of the norm is the rule. Armed with some staggering original compositions, pop standards, show tunes, and the occasional jazz cover, Workin' is the quintessence of group participation. Davis, as well as Coltrane, actually contributes compositions as well as mesmerizing performances to the album. The band's interaction on \"Four\" extends the assertion that suggests this quintet plays with the consistency of a single, albeit ten-armed, musician. One needs listen no further than the stream of solos from Davis, Coltrane, Garland, and Jones, with Paul Chambers chasing along with his rhythmic metronome. Beneath the smouldering bop of \"Trane's Blues\" are some challenging chord progressions that are tossed from musician to musician with deceptive ease. Chambers' solo stands as one of his defining contributions to this band. In sly acknowledgement to the live shows from which these studio recording sessions were inspired, Davis concludes both sets (read: album sides) with \"The Theme\" -- a brief and mostly improvised tune -- indicating to patrons that the tab must be settled. In this case, settling the tab might include checking out Steamin', the final Miles Davis Quintet recording to have been culled from these historic sessions.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

Certainly the beginning of his recording career with the label that issued most if not all of his important recordings; and the recording debut of an exciting new band that had within its ranks Philly Joe Jones, Paul Chambers, pianist Red Garland, and an all but unknown tenor player named John Coltrane. The title track was chosen because of its unique rendition with a muted trumpet, debuted at the Newport Jazz Festival the summer before to a thunderous reception. The date was also an ending of sorts because by the time of the album's release, Davis had already broken up the band, which reformed with Cannonball Adderley a year later as a sextet, but it was a tense year. Musically, this sound is as unusual and as beautiful as it was when issued in 1956.

Coltrane's solo here too is notable for its stark contrast to Davis' own: he chooses an angular tack where he finds the heart of the mode and plays a melody in harmonic counterpoint to the changes but never sounds outside. Cole Porter's \"All of You\" has Davis quoting from Louis Armstrong's \"Basin Street Blues\" in his solo that takes out the tune, and Coltrane has never respected a melody so much. But it's in \"Bye-Bye Blackbird\" that we get to hear the band gel as a unit, beginning with Davis playing through the melody, muted and sweet, slightly flatted out until he reaches the harmony on the refrain and begins his solo on a high note. Garland is doing more than comping in the background; he's slipping chord shapes into those interval cracks and shifting them as the rhythm section keeps \"soft time.\" When Coltrane moves in for his break, rather than Davis' spare method, he smatters notes quickly all though the melodic body of the tune and Garland has to compensate harmonically, moving the mode and tempo up a notch until his own solo can bring it back down again. Which he does with a gorgeous all-blues read of the tune utilizing first one hand and then both hands to create fat harmonic chords to bring Davis back in to close it out. It's breathtaking how seamless it all is. There's little else to say except that Round About Midnight is among the most essential of Davis' Columbia recordings.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek"

The concept being that the band would document their vast live performance catalog in a studio environment, rather than preparing all new tracks for their upcoming long-player. The bounty of material in the band's live sets -- as well as the overwhelming conviction in the quintet's studio sides -- would produce the lions share of the Cookin', Relaxin', Workin', and Steamin' albums. As these recordings demonstrate, there is an undeniable telepathic cohesion that allows this band -- consisting of Miles Davis (trumpet), John Coltrane (tenor sax), Red Garland (piano), and Philly Joe Jones (drums) -- to work so efficiently both on the stage as well as in the studio. This same unifying force is also undoubtedly responsible for the extrasensory dimensions scattered throughout these recordings. The immediate yet somewhat understated ability of each musician to react with the ingenuity and precision is expressed in the consistency and singularity of each solo as it is maintained from one musician to the next without the slightest deviation. \"Blues By Five\" reveals the exceptional symmetry between Davis and Coltrane that allows them to complete each other's thoughts musically. Cookin' features the pairing of \"Tune Up/When Lights Are Low,\" which is without a doubt a highlight not only of this mammoth session, but also the entire tenure of Miles Davis mid-'50s quintet. All the elements converge upon this fundamentally swinging medley. Davis' pure-toned solos and the conversational banter that connects with Coltrane and later Garland during \"When the Lights Are Low\" resounds as one of the finest moments between these musicians.</p>— <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

Each of these is considered not only to be among the pinnacle of Davis' work, but of the entire bop subgenre as well. As with the other titles, Relaxin' contains a variety of material which the band had concurrently been performing in their concert appearances. In a brilliant stroke of time conservation, the scheme was hatched for the quintet -- who includes: Davis (trumpet), John Coltrane (tenor sax), Philly Joe Jones (drums), and Red Garland (piano) -- to perform the equivalent of their live repertoire in the studio for eventual release. The results are consistently superior both in terms of song selection as well as performance. The solid nature of the unit as a singular musical force is immediately apparent. \"If I Were a Bell\" -- from the play Guys and Dolls -- includes some remarkable soloing via Coltrane and Garland. Davis' solos are additionally impressive, as they're derived from the same four-note motive as the melody. Hearing the many variations that he comes up with throughout the song conveys how intrigued Davis must have been by the tune, as it stayed in his performance repertoire for decades. Tracks such as \"You're My Everything\" and \"Oleo\" highlight the synchronic nature of Davis and Coltrane as they carry each other's melodies while trading off solos. The steady syncopation of Philly Joe Jones keeps the rhythms tight and the delicate interplay all the more conspicuous. Relaxin' offers something for every degree of jazz enthusiast. Likewise, the quintet's recordings provide a tremendous introduction for the curious jazz consumer.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

The fourth disc contains radio and television appearances which have never been released before. The first four tracks are from the Tonight Show in 1955, with Steve Allen as he gives two different spoken intros that are fine to hear once, but a drag after that (and one wonders what Miles must have thought of them), and result in two quintet performances, \"Max Is Making Wax (Chance It)\" by Oscar Pettiford and the standard \"It Never Entered My Mind.\" The six cuts are from different live shows from radio broadcasts of live gigs at the Blue Note in Philadelphia in 1956 and the Café Bohemia in New York in 1958. There are two performances of \"Walkin,\" one each of \"Four,\" \"Bye Bye Blackbird,\" and Dizzy Gillespie's \"Two Bass Hit.\" In addition, the second portion of disc four is enhanced and contains Miles solo transcriptions that are suitable for printing, two of \"Tune Up\" (the original version and the one from the Blue Note gig), and \"Four\" (both the original studio version and one from Café Bohemia). There is also a transcription of the solo played during \"Max Is Making Wax (Chance It)\" from the Tonight Show. There is a longbox booklet with a solid essay by Bob Blumenthal and it's full of groovy black-and-white photos. Miles freaks -- and trumpet players, perhaps -- will have to have this, one supposes. But as real bonus material designed to get you to buy the original recordings over again, or unless you're an an audiophile, it's rather difficult to discern the upgraded quality of sound, and seems rather pointless. The high marks are for the music, not the box set itself.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>When you talk about Miles Davis, you’re really talking about something like eight musicians: a sideman to Bird during the bebop revolution; catalyst of cool jazz; hard bop and modal pioneer; enabler of John Coltrane and leader of the “first great quintet”; nurturer of the younger “second great quintet” in the mid-'60s; collaborator in large ensembles with his musical soul mate, Gil Evans; initiator of an uncompromising jazz-rock-funk fusion; and elder statesmen of a more polished, though still-distinct, fusion in the 1980s.</p><p>Even within those periods there are fascinating mini-chapters, like his work from the early 1950s. Now, on the occasion of what would’ve been Miles Davis’ 90th birthday this month, comes The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection, a sometimes-disorienting, ultimately sumptuous set of eleven vinyl records from 1951–54, nine of which feature Miles as the sole leader.</p><p>The bulk of Miles Davis’ canonical output is on Columbia Records, which he left in 1986 for Warner Brothers in his final years. His pre-Columbia work from 1951–56 was, for the most part, on Prestige Records, a small, fledgling indie label in Hell’s Kitchen launched by Bob Weinstock in 1949. This set is not a comprehensive examination of his stay at Prestige&mdash;that is available on the 8-CD Miles Davis Chronicle: The Complete Prestige Recordings, 1951–1956&mdash;nor is there any new material here, but the recordings are in the exact format of their release, the forgotten 10-inch vinyl record, something new at the time that could accommodate more minutes than 78 rpm discs, which were the common format for popular recordings. “I was excited about the freedom this new technology would give me,” Miles wrote in his autobiography. “I had gotten tired of that three-minute lockstep that the 78s had put musicians in.”</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the 10-inch format, you’ll have to stay on your toes, as sides rarely go beyond 12 or 13 minutes (and sometimes run for as little as 8 minutes.) The set is in chronological order, more or less, to show how his work progressed, and features the original cover art, complete with typographical errors. (A 7–by–10 replica of one of Miles Davis’ paintings is also included.)</p><p>The music, too, will keep you on your toes, and enthralled. In many ways, this is one of his most rollicking periods. It’s post-Bird, post-birth-of-cool (released by Capitol Records), yet pre-great quintet with John Coltrane, which coalesced at Prestige in 1955 (not included in this set) and progressed into super-stardom at Columbia. Miles is still very much trying to find himself, musically and personally. A few of the musicians he organized for what several years later was called Birth of The Cool&mdash;white musicians, it should be said&mdash; took it to the West Coast and ran with it. Meanwhile, he was battling heroin addiction. “Heroin,” he wrote in his autobiography, “was my girlfriend.”</p><p>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection is a document then of a search, an exhilarating one: a search for self, a search for a sound, a search for an aesthetic, a search for like minds. His various band mates on these dates include: Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Jackie McLean, Charles Mingus, John Lewis, Max Roach, Lucky Thompson, Roy Haynes, Horace Silver, Milt Jackson, Thelonious Monk, and Zoot Sims, whom, according to Miles’ autobiography, he did heroin with right before they recorded Miles Davis Plays the Compositions of Al Cohn in January 1953, on LP 4. It is&mdash;maybe because of the drugs, maybe because it wasn’t Miles’ idea to play Cohn’s music&mdash;one of the rare uninspired records here. So is the first, Modern Jazz Trumpets, of which Miles is only one of four leaders, along with Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie, and the forever under-appreciated Kenny Dorham, highlighted on the cover as “Kinny.” (Remember, typos preserved.)</p><p>The rest&mdash;before H and after H&mdash;is nearly always stirring. Of that first recording, even Miles admitted he wasn’t up to par: “I didn’t play well,” Davis wrote of that January 1951 session, “but I think everyone else played well&mdash;especially Sonny [Rollins].” Indeed, Miles and Sonny had something special, and they have three dates together on this set across four of the LPs. As exceptional as some of the talent Miles assembled is, it didn’t always produce memorable partnerships. Charles Mingus, who plays piano on one tune&mdash;and he was a good piano player, just listen to Mingus Plays Piano&mdash;was never a going to be good fit with Miles. They both had huge personalities. And although he and Thelonious Monk did mesh well together, and played beautifully on four of these LPs, they clashed personally.</p><p>By around 1954, Miles wrote that he’d hoped to form a steady touring band with Rollins, Horace Silver on piano, Kenny Clarke on drums, and Percy Heath on bass. It wasn’t meant to be: Rollins had to deal with his own drug issues; Silver joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers; and Clarke went to the Modern Jazz Quartet. That great-quartet-that-never-was did have one session, on the LP Miles Davis with Sonny Rollins from June 29, 1954. The results hover around perfection as they play the Rollins originals “Oleo,” “Airegin,” “Doxy,” and the Gershwin standard “But Not for Me.”</p><p>Miles kicked his heroin habit by 1954 and had a great year, all of which is included in this set, and almost all of his sessions were now recorded at Rudy Van Gelder’s across the river in New Jersey (though in his Hackensack living room, before he built his fabled studio in Englewood Cliffs). The following year, he did settle on a band, but with another tenor, John Coltrane, a 20-year-old bassist named Paul Chambers, Red Garland on piano, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Not so bad. That quintet would go on to have recording dates for Prestige in 1955 and '56, which became the four albums Cookin’, Steamin’, Relaxin’, and Workin’, though now on 12-inch vinyl as the industry transitioned yet again by the mid-'50s.</p><p>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection can, however, be a little puzzling. If you have a collection of Miles Davis records and want to know if you already own some of this material, it might not be immediately clear. Many fans might own a previous version of, say, Walkin’, which on the cover says “Miles Davis All Stars.” But here, “Walkin’ ” appears not as an LP but merely as a tune&mdash;a phenomenal 13-minute version with the superlative tenorist Lucky Thompson&mdash;from the April 29, 1954 LP Miles Davis All Star Sextet. Nor is it spelled out that Walkin’ (the 12-inch version, released by Prestige in 1957) is a compilation of two of the 10-inch LPs&mdash;Miles Davis Quintet in addition to Miles Davis All Star Sextet&mdash;plus one song not on this set. It all gets a little eye-crossing. You can figure most of this out, eventually, flipping back-and-forth from the 12-inch or CD you own (if you do) and the enclosed booklet. It is either maddening or a little fun, depending on your disposition&mdash;the fan as archivist.</p><p>The Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection even rewards when you least expect it, like in 1951’s Lee Konitz Featuring Miles Davis, one of the few times, besides with Bird, where Miles was a sideman. (Cannonball Adderley’s 1958 Blue Note album Somethin’ Else was another, a record so luminous Uniqlo made a T-shirt out of it.) They were colleagues from Birth of the Cool, and Miles liked his playing, even defended him when he was criticized by other black musicians for hiring a white saxophonist. Konitz, the proto avant-gardist who was the first musician to record for Prestige in '49, worked hard&mdash;like Miles&mdash;to never sound like anyone else, and the two are almost otherworldly here, drifting inquisitively around each other, then as one, as if it were the birth of the free-cool. The daring hints at what would come, for Konitz (still underrated and still playing challenging music at age 88), and for Miles, always prepared to risk, always willing to move beyond his comfort zone. To hear Miles Davis develop&mdash;as a person, as a musician, and as a bandleader, in the midst of technological changes&mdash;makes this series of recordings on Prestige specialized, yes, but also quite special.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael J.

		"review": "<p><strong>Workin'</strong> is the third in a series of four featuring the classic Miles Davis Quintet: Davis (trumpet), John Coltrane (tenor sax), Red Garland (piano), and Philly Joe Jones (drums). Like its predecessors Cookin' and Relaxin', Workin' is the product of not one -- as mythology would claim -- but two massively productive recording sessions in May and October of 1956, respectively. Contradicting the standard methodology of preparing fresh material for upcoming albums, Davis and company used their far more intimate knowledge of the tunes the quintet was performing live to inform their studio recordings. As was often the case with Davis, the antithesis of the norm is the rule. Armed with some staggering original compositions, pop standards, show tunes, and the occasional jazz cover, Workin' is the quintessence of group participation. Davis, as well as Coltrane, actually contributes compositions as well as mesmerizing performances to the album. The band's interaction on \"Four\" extends the assertion that suggests this quintet plays with the consistency of a single, albeit ten-armed, musician. One needs listen no further than the stream of solos from Davis, Coltrane, Garland, and Jones, with Paul Chambers chasing along with his rhythmic metronome. Beneath the smoldering bop of \"Trane's Blues\" are some challenging chord progressions that are tossed from musician to musician with deceptive ease. Chambers' solo stands as one of his defining contributions to this band. In sly acknowledgment to the live shows from which these studio recording sessions were inspired, Davis concludes both sets (read: album sides) with \"The Theme\" -- a brief and mostly improvised tune -- indicating to patrons that the tab must be settled. In this case, settling the tab might include checking out Steamin', the final Miles Davis Quintet recording to have been culled from these historic sessions.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p><hr/><p><strong>Steamin'</strong> -- Although chronologically the last to be issued, this collection includes some of the best performances from the tapes which would produce the albums Cookin', Relaxin', Workin', and ultimately, Steamin'. A primary consideration of these fruitful sessions is the caliber of musicians -- Miles Davis (trumpet), Red Garland (piano), John Coltrane (tenor sax), and Philly Joe Jones (drums) -- who were basically doing their stage act in the studio. As actively performing musicians, the material they are most intimate with would be their live repertoire. Likewise, what more obvious place than a studio is there to capture every inescapable audible nuance of the combo's musical group mind. The end results are consistently astonishing. At the center of Steamin', as with most outings by this band, are the group improvisations which consist of solo upon solo of arguably the sweetest and otherwise most swinging interactions known to have existed between musicians. \"Surrey With the Fringe on Top\" is passed between the mates like an old joke. Garland compliments threads started by Davis and Coltrane as their seamless interaction yields a stream of strikingly lyrical passages. There are two well-placed nods to fellow bop pioneers Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on a revision of their \"Salt Peanuts.\" Philly Joe Jones' mimicking cymbal speak -- which replicates Gillespie's original vocals -- is nothing short of genius. This rendition is definitely as crazy and unpredictable here as the original. Thelonious Monk also gets kudos on \"Well, You Needn't.\" This quintet makes short work of the intricacies of the arrangement, adding the double horn lead on the choruses and ultimately redefining this jazz standard. Although there is no original material on Steamin', it may best represent the ability of the Miles Davis quintet to take standards and rebuild them to suit their qualifications.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Back in 1958, Jazz at the Plaza was never meant to be a record; it was a Columbia party at the Plaza, a place jazz had never been played before. Also on the bill were Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, and Jimmy Rushing. Despite the fine remastering job done by the Sony crew, Jazz at the Plaza remains more a curiosity piece than an essential recording by a remarkable band, strictly because of its dodgy recording quality. The 40-minute set is plagued by the problem of barely being able to hear Davis in places, particularly on the stellar opener, \"If I Were a Bell,\" and Evans is all but absent on much of the record. In fact, there is no mix; it's just a flat-out two- or three-mike set. That said, the performance is far from dodgy. There are four tunes in the set: the previously mentioned old stripe from Guys and Dolls; \"Oleo,\" played at a blistering tempo; \"My Funny Valentine,\" which, although recorded by Davis' previous quintet for Prestige, had become a staple in the sextet's play book; and Monk's \"Straight, No Chaser.\" It is perhaps the last that brings the sextet to full bloom in this performance. Davis plays the theme faster than normal, alternating the groove between full and cut time, and Bill Evans goes directly to quoting \"Blue Monk\" in his own solo. Also notable is the performance of \"My Funny Valentine\" without the saxophone giants John Coltrane or Cannonball Adderley. But here, again, given the recording quality, it just feels like they weren't miked -- the audience is louder than the band on most of this. Nonetheless, Davis had turned the tune inside out by this time and was playing it in his new modal style; the melody became a skeleton and was replaced by the ghosts of intervals that kept its integrity and made it recognizable. This is not to say Davis had abandoned melody for mode entirely because his melodic sensibility, which was instinctual, is what made the modalism on the sextet level possible in the first place. Ultimately, Jazz at the Plaza succeeds mightily on the level of its fine performance, but is for hardcore jazz fans only, due to its dubious sound quality.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>What is immediately noticeable upon listening to this delicately and superbly remastered version of Miles Davis classic first — and only — album with his original sextet is how deep the blues presence is on it. Though it is true that the album's title cut is rightfully credited with introducing modalism into jazz, and defining Davis' music for years to come, it is the sole selection of its kind on the record. The rest is all blues in any flavor you wish you call your own. For starters, there's the steaming bebop blues of \"Dr. Jackie\" — recorded in 1955 for a Prestige session with Jackie McLean. Davis is still in his role as a trumpet master, showing a muscularity of tone that reveals something more akin to Roy Eldridge or Louis Armstrong than Dizzy or Fats Navarro. The tempo is furious as all the members of the sextet solo except for Jones. The saxophonists trade choruses and come off sounding like mirrored images of one another in the slower, post-bop blues that is \"Sid's Ahead.\" With a slippery melody line that quotes two harmonic lines from early New Orleans-styled blues, Davis drives the band into the rhythm section's garage. It's Cannonball first with his stuttered, angular lines, hiccuping halfway through the interval before continuing on with a squeak here and the slightest squawk there. Next up is Davis, blowing fluid and straightened lines, ribbons through the rhythm section's center as Red Garland lays out and leaves it to Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones to provide the earnest, time-keeping 4/4 that Davis sidles to in the tune. When Coltrane solos, all best are off as he plays as pure a blues as he was capable at the time. Nonetheless, there are the long lines of slurred notes, smattered against Garland's harmonies and he slips into quoting \"Skip to my Lou\" before knotting it back down to the basics and even then not for long. Coltrane was already exploring the edges of mode and harmony; he used an intervallic invention in the choruses to juxtapose his solo against the rhythm section and it worked — but it must have made Davis raise an eyebrow. Chambers' solo is as tasteful and as breezy and free as only he could be. His contrapuntal soloing rides the rhythm out, Garland striding along quietly until the tune returns.</p><p>\"Sid's Ahead\" is followed by the track \"Two Bass Hit,\" written by Dizzy and John Lewis. It's an off-kilter blues with a wide middle section, no doubt for Lewis' piano to fill. It's a wonderful ensemble showcase but Davis blows his ass off in his solo, riding through the two saxophonists and challenging them at the same time. But then comes \"Milestones\" with its modal round and interval, where harmony is constructed from the center up. It is a memorable tune for not only its structure and how it would inform not only Davis' own music, but jazz in general for the next seven years. It would also change John Coltrane's life. The exploratory style of soloing was already revealing itself in Trane's playing, but he loosens it up even more here. More importantly, this is the first place we get to see it in Davis, where there is no goal at the end of the rainbow, there is merely the solo itself in the heart of the mode. The alternate take of this tune, which is featured at the end of the album, tagged on with two others of \"Two Bass Hit\" and \"Straight, No Chaser,\" has an even longer and weirder solo by Davis where he plays notes he probably never played again. The album's closer is Monk's \"Straight, No Chaser,\" which became a signature tune for the sextet even when Garland and Jones left to be replaced by Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb and later Evans by Wynton Kelly. Like \"My Funny Valentine,\" it was a Davis staple that accented how intuitive the band was with unusual harmonic structures like Monk's. The Adderley solo is remarkable for its fluid, bebop-style runs over Garland's extended chords and flatted sevenths. Cannonball quotes the melody in a myriad of ways and goes off the deep end each time he does, taking the new rendition to its limit, always returning it to the blues root. Davis plays it cool, slithering around the rhythm section staying firmly in blues phraseology, even quoting a reverse harmonic melodic read of \"When the Saints Go Marching In,\" bringing it in and out three times while pushing the blues line to its edge. Coltrane's solo is all over the place, slurring notes as he plays weird scales all over the blues and triple times the rhythm section. But he knows the tune better than anyone here — he spent six months with Monk just previous to this playing it every night. Coltrane knows how much he can stretch the intervals without breaking apart the body. He inserts his own modal interpretation on the blues halfway through his solo before slipping into the straight, swinging groove of his Blue Train album, finished only two months before. Garland, oddly enough, is the one to travel the furthest from Monk here, coming off with a Bud Powell-esque blues muscle that shifts the entire tune into a straight bebop blues before sifting in a few Errol Garland quotes as the bass solos and then the front line comes in to take it out. The alternate take is even stranger as Garland falters in his time not once but twice and has to find his way back in.</p><p>Legacy has done it proud on this series of reissues, as the sound is as fine as technology can currently make it, the notes are terrific, and the alternate takes offer additional delights to fans of the original recordings. They should also be commended for leaving them at the bottom of the album instead of placing them in with the original album's sequence, a practice that though widely used is distracting nonetheless. This is a fine issue of a classic, and treated like the piece of art it is.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>The sixth volume in Legacy's Miles Davis Bootleg Series circles back to 1999's Miles Davis and John Coltrane: The Complete Columbia Recordings 1955-1961, with an exclamation point. The four discs here are taken from five concerts in March 1960: Two sets from L'Olympia in Paris, two at Stockholm's Konserthuset, and one from Copenhagen's Tivolis Koncertsal. The three-week European tour was part of the Jazz at the Philharmonic series produced by George Wein. Accounts from Davis and drummer Jimmy Cobb claim certifiable tension surrounding John Coltrane. He left the band at the end of 1959 and reportedly had to be talked (hard) into taking the gig by Davis. It was the trumpeter's first European tour as an international jazz star, and the band -- with Cobb, pianist Wynton Kelly, and bassist Paul Chambers were among the cats who recorded 1959's Kind of Blue.</p><p>From the opening moments of \"All of You\" in the first Paris show, it's obvious that what's happening on-stage wasn't planned. It took everyone, with the possible exception of Coltrane, by surprise, and is more than 17-minutes long. The lengthy solo by the saxophonist greets the changes with dissonance, sharp angles, and a (then) atypical fury as he tries out new sounds, fingerings, and breathing techniques. Kelly brings it back inside with his own solo, light, fleet, expert, and swinging. \"All of You\" is followed by a blazing 13-minute \"So What,\" offered with the illuminating contrast that would underscore the tour: The reinvention of standards from the '40s and '50s with more open, less melodic modal jazz epitomized by the Kind of Blue material. In the first version of \"All Blues,\" Davis follows Chambers and Kelly by adding more physicality to his own playing without sacrificing his lyric invention. It foreshadows Coltrane's wailing solo full of multiphonics, honks, and banks of layered scales that wove together East and West. The short reading of the bop standard \"Oleo\" is the only place in either of the Paris concerts where the saxophonist reigns himself in. \"All Blues\" from Copenhagen is also faster. Chambers' short solo intro is picked up by Kelly's fat vamp and Cobb's stutter-step beat before Davis takes the lean melody and stretches it, opening a door for Coltrane, who commences slowly before breaking its structure wide open. Once more, it's Kelly's grooving solo with glorious right-hand flourishes that brings the hard swing back to the equation. All the music here is filled with these moments. The decision to rework the standards in order to make room for more openness was wise and all one needs to do is check the three versions of \"On Green Dolphin Street\" here for evidence. Interestingly, while the tour established Davis' international rep for good, it was Coltrane who benefitted most from the tour -- he was all but unknown before it, and unforgettable after. The tape sources are all official: The Copenhagen gig is remastered from a state radio broadcast and the other two concerts are from producers' archives, making this historic set among the most essential in the Bootleg Series.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>The audible friction between Davis and Coltrane on almost every number of this four-disc set makes for a fascinating listen, a live document of two players undergoing tectonic shifts in their style.</p><p>By 1960, modern jazz was in upheaval. This shift was thanks in no small part to the seismic, artistic advances that Miles Davis and his quintet had made the year prior when he released Kind of Blue, a still-astonishing document of restraint and free melodic expression that would go on to become one of the best-selling jazz albums of all-time. That same year, John Coltrane also pivoted to the cascading changes and torrential outpouring (deemed \"sheets of sound\") of his breakout solo album, Giant Steps. Distinct from the restrained and cool sound of his boss, Coltrane was well on his own skyward trajectory when Davis brought him back to the fold for a European tour booked by jazz impresario Norman Granz, which also featured Stan Getz on tenor sax and Oscar Peterson on piano. It marked the first time Davis would tour with his own band, and they were met with packed houses and rapturous applause each night. But as Davis wrote in his 1989 autobiography: \"[Coltrane] decided to go with us, but he grumbled and complained and sat by himself all the time we were over there.\"</p><p>These three weeks of grumbling and complaining comprise Miles Davis and John Coltrane: The Final Tour, the sixth edition of Columbia's Miles Davis Bootleg Series. Across the five previous installments lies a latent theme of tension and change, each volume revealing a transitory aspect of Davis' sound. But none bear the audible friction between Davis and Coltrane on almost every number of this four-disc set, which draws from two concerts in Paris, two from Stockholm, and one from Copenhagen. You can hear the sideman straining to push past Davis—the man primarily responsible for realizing that Coltrane could be Coltrane. In turn, Coltrane's stratospheric rise would soon lead Davis to raze his sound to its foundation and build it up anew in the years to come.</p><p>From the song selection on this volume, it's clear Davis is already approaching a crossroads in his own repertoire. He wants to explore both the Kind of Blue material still fresh on his mind while also satisfying the crowd with the type of exquisite balladry that had helped make him one of the most famous jazz artists of the era. So the fake book standards from his 1957 album 'Round About Midnight are juxtaposed with the emotive modal jazz monoliths \"So What\" and \"All Blues\" from Kind of Blue, all featuring the blowing of Coltrane, who sometimes sounds like he's trying to explode the songs from within.</p><p>For instance, Davis and band move at a dizzying double-time tempo on the four sprawling takes of \"So What.\" Rather than the iconic smoldering slink that opens Kind of Blue, Paul Chambers' slow vamp speeds up to a roiling bassline. At this speed, it's a treat to hear the nimble pianist Wynton Kelly tackle the number, adding a bluesy and rollicking feel to the chart. On the first performance at the Olympia in Paris, Davis soars to the upper register in his solo before drifting back down. Coltrane enters with a bluesy phrase that briefly aligns with Davis before his vibrato opens wide. Coltrane starts pushing at the boundaries of the song, the flurry of notes coming faster and faster.</p><p>Coltrane sounds a little confined in the changes, like he's straining to break free not just from the song but the earth's gravitational pull. Nearing the nine-minute mark, his overblowing and dissonance elicits a few hoots and whistles. While the \"new thing\" in jazz was already stirring and gaining steam thanks to the likes of Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, and Sun Ra's reedsman John Gilmore, few in the European audience would have experienced such new sounds live.</p><p>The raspy dissonance Coltrane flashes on \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" earns plenty of whistles and shouts, and only on \"Round Midnight\" is he compact and concise within the song. Whether it was from the promoters, the press, or Davis himself, who never had a good word to say about the free jazz stylings of Coleman or Taylor, Coltrane feels a little bit more reigned in after this particular night.</p><p>Not that there isn't plenty to admire outside of the outré. Kelly's take on Bill Evans' original, more ascetic piano lines adds a new wrinkle to \"All Blues,\" swinging between two chords and giving the horns plenty of space to move. Meanwhile, Coltrane's solo fidgets like a hummingbird around a blossom, attacking the song from as many angles as manageable while Kelly's own turn features playful cascades and big shimmering chords.</p><p>The solo order remains the same throughout the set (Davis, then Coltrane, then Kelly, and sometimes Chambers), so a sense of predictability does settle in across the four discs. Which is not to say that there's still not plenty of play to be had here, as sly allusions abound throughout: Davis quotes a line of \"Dixie\" on one version of \"Walkin',\" Kelly plinks in a phrase of Monk's \"In Walked Bud\" during \"So What,\" Coltrane quotes \"Willow Weep for Me\" one night in Stockholm. And amid Coltrane's nightly quests through \"So What,\" he starts to sow the seeds for what would in a few years become one of his signature songs, \"Impressions,\" itself built on the same harmonic structure as the Kind of Blue song.</p><p>That's not the only advance Coltrane made on his last tour with Davis. \"Before he quit, I gave him that soprano saxophone,\" Davis recalled in his autobiography, the instrument that would come to signify Coltrane's ascension to spiritual jazz. \"I always joked with him that if he had stayed home and not come with us on this trip, he wouldn't have gotten that soprano saxophone, so he was in debt to me for as long as he lived.\" It's a patented Miles blend of joke and hyperbole. But his relationship with Coltrane proved to be the kind of impetus that would push Davis to reinvent himself, as well. Soon after, neither star would sound quite like this again.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Andy Beta</strong></p>"

Even when the tempo picks up, as it does on the title track, there's little of the dense, manic energy on Miles Smiles -- this is about subtle shadings, even when the compositions are as memorable as Tony Williams' \"Pee Wee\" or Herbie Hancock's \"Sorcerer.\" As such, it's a little elusive, since it represents the deepening of the band's music as they choose to explore different territory. The emphasis is as much on complex, interweaving chords and a coolly relaxed sound as it is on sheer improvisation, though each member tears off thoroughly compelling solos. Still, the individual flights aren't placed at the forefront the way they were on the two predecessors -- it all merges together, pointing toward the dense soundscapes of Miles' later '60s work. It's such a layered, intriguing work that the final cut, recorded in 1962 with Bob Dorough on vocals, is an utterly jarring, inappropriate way to end the record, even if it's intended as a tribute to Miles' then-wife, Cicely Tyson (whose image graces the cover).</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Since it's billed as \"Directions in Music By Miles Davis,\" it should come as little surprise that Filles de Kilimanjaro is the beginning of a new phase for Miles, the place that he begins to dive headfirst into jazz-rock fusion. It also happens to be the swan song for his second classic quintet, arguably the finest collective of musicians he ever worked with, and what makes this album so fascinating is that it's possible to hear the breaking point -- though his quintet all followed him into fusion (three of his supporting players were on In a Silent Way), it's possible to hear them all break with the conventional notions of what constituted even adventurous jazz, turning into something new. According to Miles, the change in \"direction\" was as much inspired by a desire to return to something earthy and bluesy as it was to find new musical territory, and Filles de Kilimanjaro bears him out.

It also happens to be the swan song for his second classic quintet, arguably the finest collective of musicians he ever worked with, and what makes this album so fascinating is that it's possible to hear the breaking point -- though his quintet all followed him into fusion (three of his supporting players were on In a Silent Way), it's possible to hear them all break with the conventional notions of what constituted even adventurous jazz, turning into something new. According to Miles, the change in \"direction\" was as much inspired by a desire to return to something earthy and bluesy as it was to find new musical territory, and Filles de Kilimanjaro bears him out.

		"review": "<p>With the 1968 album Miles in the Sky, Miles Davis explicitly pushed his second great quintet away from conventional jazz, pushing them toward the jazz-rock hybrid that would later become known as fusion. Here, the music is still in its formative stages, and it's a little more earth-bound than you might expect, especially following on the heels of the shape-shifting, elusive Nefertiti. On Miles in the Sky, much of the rhythms are straightforward, picking up on the direct 4/4 beats of rock, and these are illuminated by Herbie Hancock's electric piano -- one of the very first sounds on the record, as a matter of fact -- and the guest appearance of guitarist George Benson on \"Paraphernalia.\" All of these additions are tangible and identifiable, and they do result in intriguing music, but the form of the music itself is surprisingly direct, playing as extended grooves. This meanders considerable more than Nefertiti, even if it is significantly less elliptical in its form, because it's primarily four long jams. Intriguing, successful jams in many respects, but even with the notable additions of electric instruments, and with the deliberately noisy \"Country Son,\" this is less visionary than its predecessor and feels like a transitional album -- and, like many transitional albums, it's intriguing and frustrating in equal measures.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Thought by many to be among the most revolutionary albums in jazz history, Miles Davis' Bitches Brew solidified the genre known as jazz-rock fusion. It being the jazz album to most influence jazz, rock, and funk musicians after 1970, by its very nature it is legend. The original double LP included only six cuts and featured up to 12 musicians at any given time, some of whom were already established while others would become high-profile players later: Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Airto, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, Don Alias, Bennie Maupin, Larry Young, and Lenny White among them.</p><p>Originally thought to be a series of long jams locked into grooves around keyboard, bass, or guitar vamps, Bitches Brew is actually a recording that producer Teo Macero assembled from various jams by razor-blade: splice to splice and section to section. \"Pharaoh's Dance\" opens the set with its slippery trumpet lines and McLaughlin's snaky guitar figures skirting the edge of the rhythm section, as Alias' conga slipping through the middle. Corea's and Zawinul's keyboards create a haunted, riffing modal groove, echoed and accented by the basses of Harvey Brooks and Holland. The title cut was originally composed as a five-part suite, though only three were used. Here the keyboards punch through the mix, big chords ring up distorted harmonics for Davis to solo rhythmically over, outside the mode. McLaughlin comps with a vamp, and the bass and drums carry the rest. It's a small taste of the deep voodoo funk to appear on Davis' later records. Side three opens with McLaughlin and Davis trading fours and eights over a lock-step hypnotic vamp on \"Spanish Key.\" Zawinul's trademark lyric sensibility provides a near-chorus for Corea to flit around in; the congas and drummers juxtapose themselves against the basslines. It neatly segues into the brief \"John McLaughlin,\" featuring an organ playing modes below arpeggiated blues guitar runs. The end of Bitches Brew, signified by the stellar \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,\" reflects the influence of Jimi Hendrix with its chunky slipped chords and Davis playing a ghostly melody through the shimmering funkiness of the rhythm section. It seemingly dances, becoming increasingly more chaotic until it nearly disintegrates before shimmering into a loose, foggy nadir. The disc closes with \"Sanctuary,\" completely redone here as a moody electric ballad, reworked for this band, but it keeps enough of its integrity to be recognizable. Bitches Brew is so forward thinking, it retains its freshness and mystery in the 21st century. [Sony Legacy's 40th Anniversary Edition contains three CDs and a DVD. These remasters from the original eight-track tapes contain two newly discovered and previously unreleased alternate takes of \"Spanish Key\" and \"John McLaughlin.\" Also included are the 45 edits of \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,\" \"Spanish Key,\" \"Great Expectations,\" and \"Little Blue Frog.\" The 71-minute DVD called Copenhagen Live 1969, includes a complete performance by a quintet that includes Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette, three months prior to the release of Bitches Brew. The arrangements of the album's tunes are scaled down, and the playing is freer, further outside than the recordings. In addition, some of Davis' previous quintet numbers are given some eclectic, electric treatments, including \"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\" \"Directions,\" and \"Agitation.\" The DVD's quality is sonically fine, though visually a bit grainy around the edges, though it doesn't hinder the enjoyment at all. The booklet comes with an excellent new liner essay by Greg Tate that takes a completely different cultural tact compared to Legacy's other Davis reissues.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>There's a passage in Miles Davis' notorious 1990 autobiography where he's talking about how much quality music he recorded in the mid-to-late 1960s with his current quintet-- the group featuring Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. \"I made six studio dates with this group in four years,\" he says. \"And there were some live recordings that I guess Columbia will release when they think they can make the most money-- probably after I'm dead.\" I can remember chuckling at that line when reading the book the year of its publication, but it would have been difficult to imagine just how extensive and sustained the Miles Davis reissue program would actually be after his death in 1991. The anniversary sets; the complete studio sessions boxes; the boxes collecting the boxes. It goes on and on and every new gift season brings another new offering.And now here's the latest, from a couple of years after the period Davis mentioned: two re-releases of the legendary 1970 2xLP set Bitches Brew. One is a 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition gathering together the original album on one and a quarter CDs, along with studio outtakes, another CD containing a previously unissued set recorded at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass., in August 1970, and a DVD containing a previously unissued concert in Copenhagen from November 1969. The other version of the album is part of Columbia's Legacy Edition and contains the first two CDs from the 40th Anniversary set along with the Copenhagen DVD.There's a reason Bitches Brew is getting this kind of treatment, even after the release of the 4xCD Complete Bitches Brew box set 12 years ago. It is, after all, one of the three or four most important albums of Miles Davis' career. And coming nine months after In a Silent Way, it is also one of founding texts of jazz fusion. It's a Big Deal Jazz album that's been tapped as being an essential part of any collection. Which unfortunately is something that tends to obscure the actual music. Putting on Bitches Brew and then straining to The first thing that Bitches Brew made clear is that Miles was keenly interested in expanding the idea of what his music could be, and was starting to stretch it way out. The title track runs 26 minutes, which then and now is at the extreme end of what a side of vinyl on an LP can hold; the opening \"Pharaoh's Dance\" also breaks 20 minutes. And these pieces weren't lengthy compositions or single jams, but were assembled by Miles and producer Teo Macero through editing-- unrelated tracks could become one piece through the miracle of the razor blade and magnetic tape. For an improvisatory art form that was founded on the idea collective expression in the present moment, the idea of stitching together pieces into a new whole was radical enough on its own. But Miles was changing his approach in several ways simultaneously as the 1960s came to a close.  He was processing his trumpet with echo, working with electric keyboards and electric guitar, adding new percussion colors, experimenting with rock rhythms, doing away with chord changes, and building long tracks from riffs and vamps. And, as the liner notes from Greg Tate included with these sets illustrate, he was hanging out with Betty Davis, who was introducing him to new music, and along the way he had become a fan of Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and James Brown.All of these elements swirled together into a record of brilliant and fascinating contradictions. The psychedelic cover art and long electric jams on the one hand anchor the music in Age of Aquarius, but the connections to earlier jazz tradition and unmoored, floating quality of music also lend it a timeless feel. It sounds very much like a bunch of dudes jamming in the room, but some of the abrupt edits serve as a reminder that it owes a lot to technology. It finds Miles distancing himself from his musical past, but it sounds equally far from the dense abstraction his music would take on a couple of years later, especially in a live setting. It was long and hard to get a handle on, but it was also a huge commercial success. Ultimately, Bitches Brew seems mostly like a single beautiful frame from a jarring film filled with jump-cuts. The amount that Miles Davis' music changed from the early 60s to the early 70s is astonishing. His sound was constantly on the move, and this is what it sounded like on those August days in the studio.The bonus material illustrates just how quickly Davis' music was changing, and how much his music could vary given the context. Three months after Bitches Brew was recorded (but before it was released), he performed in Copenhagen with a five-piece band that included Wayne Shorter. Chick Corea's electric piano aside, the music is acoustic, though several tunes from Bitches Brew are included (the video is exceptional in quality in terms of both sound and image). In this setting, Davis' music sounds like what most people would identify as \"jazz,\" and is less challenging than the cerebral and harmonically complex music he'd made just a few years earlier with his quintet. But by the August 1970 set included with the 40th Anniversary edition, the raging funk maelstrom that would epitomize his live shows in the next four years was on the rails. What a difference nine months made for Miles Davis as 1969 turned into 1970.The two sets sit at opposite ends of the value scale. Listing at about $19, the Legacy Edition seems to me a very good buy-- the original album is a 2xCD set, the outtakes are reasonably interesting, and the Copenhagen DVD is a vital addition to the Davis canon. Also included on the second disc are four tracks edited down for release as 7\" singles, and they are interesting curios good for one play but not much more-- three-minute edits are the opposite of what this music is about. The 40th Anniversary Set, on the other hand, goes for over $100 and is obviously geared toward Davis completists-- for them, it actually delivers pretty well as these sets go, since the 1970 live set is excellent, there are some extra visual goodies, and it's not padded out with a promotional film masquerading as a documentary (it also comes with two 180 gram vinyl discs-- I'll never quite get why someone wants both CD and LP sets.) How much is left in the vault? We'll see, maybe when the album turns 50.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

If one listens to Joe Zawinul's original version of \"In a Silent Way,\" it comes across as almost a folk song with a very pronounced melody. The version Miles Davis and Teo Macero assembled from the recording session in July of 1968 is anything but. There is no melody, not even a melodic frame. There are only vamps and solos, grooves layered on top of other grooves spiraling toward space but ending in silence. But even these don't begin until almost ten minutes into the piece. It's Miles and McLaughlin, sparely breathing and wending their way through a series of seemingly disconnected phrases until the groove monster kicks in. The solos are extended, digging deep into the heart of the ethereal groove, which was dark, smoky, and ashen. McLaughlin and Hancock are particularly brilliant, but Corea's solo on the Fender Rhodes is one of his most articulate and spiraling on the instrument ever. The A-side of the album, \"Shhh/Peaceful,\" is even more so. With Tony Williams shimmering away on the cymbals in double time, Miles comes out slippery and slowly, playing over the top of the vamp, playing ostinato and moving off into more mysterious territory a moment at a time. With Zawinul's organ in the background offering the occasional swell of darkness and dimension, Miles could continue indefinitely. But McLaughlin is hovering, easing in, moving up against the organ and the trills by Hancock and Corea; Wayne Shorter hesitantly winds in and out of the mix on his soprano, filling space until it's his turn to solo. But John McLaughlin, playing solos and fills throughout (the piece is like one long dreamy solo for the guitarist), is what gives it its open quality, like a piece of music with no borders as he turns in and through the commingling keyboards as Holland paces everything along. When the first round of solos ends, Zawinul and McLaughlin and Williams usher it back in with painterly decoration and illumination from Corea and Hancock. Miles picks up on another riff created by Corea and slips in to bring back the ostinato \"theme\" of the work. He plays glissando right near the very end, which is the only place where the band swells and the tune moves above a whisper before Zawinul's organ fades it into silence. This disc holds up, and perhaps is even stronger because of the issue of the complete sessions. It is, along with Jack Johnson and Bitches Brew, a signature Miles Davis session from the electric era.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Of all the recording sessions completed by Miles Davis with his various bands, the sessions surrounding In a Silent Way Sessions in 1968 and 1969 are easily the most mysterious and enigmatic. For starters, they signified the completion of his transformation from acoustic to electric sound, and secondly, they marked the complete dissolution of the \"second\" quintet of Davis, Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, and Ron Carter that had begun on Filles de Kilimanjaro. The addition of Chick Corea as a second keyboard player and the replacement of Ron Carter with Dave Holland had changed the sound of the band's dynamic, textural, and rhythmic palettes. The final break with Davis' own previous musical sound happened when he added guitarist John McLaughlin and keyboardist/composer Joe Zawinul (for a temporary three-keyboard sound). The music on the In a Silent Way Sessions comes packaged three ways, all of it chronologically ordered: there is the material used to finish Filles de Kilimanjaro (\"Mademoiselle Maby\" and \"Freon Brun\"); material that has been, up until now, unissued in any form; session outtakes that appeared, in edited form, on Circle in the Round, Water Babies, and Directions; unissued and rejected takes; and finally, the music recorded for In a Silent Way itself as it was rehearsed, played, and finally, heavily edited into the released album, which also appears here.</p><p>This was an ambitious undertaking, even if it only covered six months in the recording life of Davis (September 1968 through February 1969), whose musical inspirations and directions were crisscrossing as they were changing direction. With the exception of one tune, Davis or Zawinul composed everything here. Zawinul, though a jazz veteran, was discovering new ways to write &mdash; particularly since the advent of the electric piano &mdash; and proved to be a profound influence on his employer. The other heavy influence on Davis during this volatile, fertile period was Tony Williams, who was soaking up the pop music of the day, from the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's album (via a girlfriend's suggestion) to the in-his-prime James Brown, to Jimi Hendrix. On Disc One, the set begins with the missing tracks from the quintet box set: \"Mademoiselle Mabry\" and \"Frelon Brun.\" Hearing them in this context, as the first complete expressions of Davis' new sound, is revelatory. For the first time the three-chord vamp in \"Mademoiselle Mabry\" comes across as the fitting tribute to Hendrix it should have been, echoing the turnaround tags in \"The Wind Cries Mary.\" These tracks mark the entrance of Dave Holland into the band and the first marked absence of Hancock. The contrast in styles, from Hancock's chunky, groove-laden chords and single-note runs and Corea's deep, cerebral spaciousness, is remarkable; it's a wonder they were issued on the same record at all. The simple, slow-jam riff the former tune evokes was, in some way, the cornerstone on which the material for these sessions would be built, while the latter provided the space and pace for its establishment.</p><p>The elegantly spaced-out \"Two Faced\" and \"Dual Mr. Anthony Tillmon Williams Process\" were recorded as a sextet with Hancock. Both tunes are a showcase for the interplay between both keyboardists and Holland, whose near-mystical lyricism was exactly what Davis was looking for in a bass player &mdash; one who could change the role of the instrument in an ensemble setting. The loose-jam feeling on these tunes could be heard by some as meandering, but it would be shortsighted to assume this for the entire picture. The various extrapolations on blues-feel and meter &mdash; moving them into modal settings and then deconstructing these for a streamlined, open music that allowed for both improvisation and direct musical interplay between various members &mdash; were integral and created in Davis' music a space that changed jazz forever. Disc One ends with the full version of \"Splash\" that appeared on Circle in the Round. Here, all of its four interludes are included after the unedited version of the tune. All of the interludes were recorded as scripted fragments with no improvisation, and featured Hancock playing electric harpsichord and Corea on organ. Lastly there is \"Splashdown,\" the first Davis recording that features Zawinul and the three-keyboard lineup. Here too, the track was unissued, and one has to wonder why, because the dialogue between the three principals, and Holland and Williams, is remarkable &mdash; Davis is all but absent, but it hardly matters as Shorter covers his territory well. With two electric pianos and an organ, the tune is so psychedelic and fat; full of a kind of inherent funkiness brought by the rhythm section, and Shorter underscores the jazz element in his solo by taking two cues from Coltrane and turning them into modal paragraphs. Both interludes that follow the tune were also rejected.</p><p>Disc Two is where the In a Silent Way project begins in earnest. The next set is from the album issued in 1981 as Directions. The three tracks that comprise it reveal just how far Davis was willing to take the massive keyboard section. With slow, drifting, methodical improvisation concerned more with the development of sound and texture than riffs and intervals, the Davis group drifts through \"Ascent,\" with Zawinul keeping the color hushed and silvery as Hancock improvises and Corea plays a series of modulated, though very subtle, changes. The most noticeable change is on the driving \"Directions,\" both Pieces One and Two. Williams has been replaced, for this session at least, with Jack DeJohnette, and the driving, slippery force of DeJohnette's drumming with Shorter's precisely punctuated soprano solo is overwhelming in its glorious intensity. These are both unedited takes, recorded as they happened without studio trickery from Teo Macero. The second take is slower, more defined; the intimate speech that developed between Shorter and Zawinul here offers a first glimpse of the sound that would be the genesis of Weather Report a little over a year later. For the time being, largely due to the intuitive improvisation of DeJohnette's drumming, the sound of \"Directions\" was a rock sound with wild intervalic fanfare and slippery rhythms shifting under the explosive interplay between soloists and ensemble. From the middle to the end of Disc Two, the In a Silent Way project begins to take shape. The first version of \"Shhh/Peaceful\" rings with the presence of John McLaughlin's guitar. The first version is a bit faster from the jump than the one released later &mdash; and heavily edited. There is no chord structure to the tune; there's just a small groove figure with solo vamps appearing all over it. The bassline is doubled by Corea's electric piano; Hancock's silky piano accompaniment fills in the shapes. The hi-hat and McLaughlin's guitar shimmer colors and nuances as Davis enters with the only solo he could play to such beautiful accompaniment. There is an accented chordal passageway from the middle to the end where Zawinul enters, creating a series of overtones with his organ that lend a spectral, eerie presence to the proceedings. It dissolves eventually, only to give way to the intro to Zawinul's gorgeous \"In a Silent Way/It's About That Time.\" The rehearsal version has a ton of chords compared to the way it was written; they were added as coloration devices to involve the instrumentalists in a deeper way. First, there is the reductionism of McLaughlin playing the melody in just one chord, and then Davis and Shorter enter to play over the Rhodes and doubled bassline. When the early recorded versions are set in place, and McLaughlin opens the tune, you can feel how much the tune has developed from the rehearsal tape. The pace is tortoise-like; everything is gone from the mix, and there's just that guitar with Zawinul eventually adding his organ and Hancock slinking his piano into the intervals. When the band does enter, it's via Shorter's sweet, singing soprano rather than Davis' trumpet. It's reduced to essence as a melodic frame with no foundation to hook onto, as transitory and elegant as it is beautiful. The suspended vamp that begins \"It's About That Time\" is a floating one; it never anchors itself to either E or F sharp. Hancock offers the chords and Corea and Zawinul join him, playing shifting, ghostly fills before McLaughlin jumps in and doubles the keyboards sleepily with a bluesy graciousness. The piece was recorded in sections, so everything heard here has an illusory quality to it, because Macero edited it all into one tune. Solos and density structures mark the individual takes; Hancock and McLaughlin deconstruct tonalities in favor of sound, creating overtonal ambiences. The rest of the set offers finished, wonderfully remastered versions of both \"In a Silent Way/It's About That Time\" and \"Shhh/Peaceful\": those that appeared on the original LP.</p><p>Bob Belden's revealing, insightful, and authoritative liner notes tell the fascinating story of how the recorded tracks were edited into final versions; so no need to go into it here. But the two other tracks recorded with the same band minus Tony Williams &mdash; replaced by Joe Chambers, of all people &mdash; are both unissued: \"The Ghetto Walk\" and \"Early Minor.\" Both are deeply Hendrix-influenced, using his choice of keys and a series of sevenths around E flat, B flat, and A flat, and finally shifting themselves, in transmuted form, to the big daddy of all rock keys, E. Both of these tracks, filled with space, blues, rock, and killer piano and organ fills, are rhythmically carried by Holland and danced through the pocket by Chambers, who, while not as muscular as either Williams or DeJohnette, was more nuanced as a blues player, which is what these two awesome numbers called for, as they turned out to be &mdash; especially \"Ghetto Walk\" &mdash; the precursors to the material that would be recorded for Jack Johnson a year later. There is nothing extra in this set in terms of fluff, viscera, or detritus. All of the material included from these sessions offers perhaps the most fascinating look to date into the musical mind of Miles Davis, who was undergoing a revolution of his own &mdash; he looked to the younger players for inspiration and guidance in how to handle the new forms; the liner notes bear this atypical personification out. Each track is an audible step in that development, and a step toward the goal of what would be the first Miles Davis \"groove\" album &mdash; not in the Blue Note sense of the vernacular &mdash; one of atmosphere and ambience and texture and drift &mdash; not of melodies and changes. The package is handsome and well-illustrated to be sure, but the music alone is worth the package price. In many ways &mdash; far more so than the Bitches Brew sessions &mdash; this is the long-sought key that unlocks the door to the room that has the answers as to why and how Davis made such a complete break with his own music on In a Silent Way &mdash; a music which he never returned to &mdash; at least on record. It's the first box set in a long time that's been worth playing from beginning to end. [This set was reissued in 2004 with different packaging.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Miles had a new girl. Her name was Betty, and she told him all about what the kids were listening to. Being a singer herself, she had some connection to the inside world of pop and soul, but mostly, she was just a lot younger than him, and was probably instinctively more drawn to that music than Miles was. It's not as if Miles was completely out of touch with popular trends, but on tour and in the studio as frequently as he was, one could hardly blame him for receiving information second-hand. Betty told him all about Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and the Fifth Dimension (hopefully in that order), and he was keen to investigate the new sounds. Years later he would brag about being able to put together a rock band that would blow all the others away, but he approached the idiom cautiously and methodically at first. Additionally, Miles was getting insider info from his drummer, Tony Williams. Tony was younger even than Betty Mabry, and although he'd come of age deep inside one of the most popular bands in jazz (even if jazz's popularity wasn't what it had been ten years previous), he had his finger very much on the pulse of hip new music. Tony had especially enjoyed the new funk from James Brown and the boogaloo grooves being played by Jimmy McGriff and Richard \"Groove\" Holmes' bands. Betty and Tony were playing a key role for Miles Davis in the late 60s, even beyond their personal and performing ones. The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions release details a six-month stretch in 1968-69 when the various advisors in Miles' life would see their seeds sprout into fauna so full of life and outrageous fertility that the face of his idiom would be forever changed. Of course, the final product of all this investigation and experimentation has been the subject of countless essays on Miles' genius, but it bears closer inspection to reveal that the trumpeter didn't just up and create this music out of thin air. He spent months in the studio rehearsing on tape, midwifing his ideas. In late '68, Miles was a painter using one canvas to try and retry his masterpiece, continually repainting over areas where, though the ideas were fresh and the colors vibrant, the concept was yet immature.</p><p>As a palette, Miles chose only the best primaries from two continents. At the time, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock were mainstays from his second great quintet. Bassist Ron Carter had become so busy with sessions in New York that Miles had to find a replacement. In between gigs in England, he saw Dave Holland's band opening for Bill Evans. Miles was immediately struck by the young bassist, and sent word via Philly Jo Jones and his manager (Miles had the best connections) that he wanted Dave. Elsewhere, when it became apparent Hancock was going to have trouble making a recording date, Williams recommended the young Boston native Chick Corea as a replacement. This quintet (Davis, Shorter, Williams, Holland and Corea) produced the first tunes on this release in September 1968.</p><p>\"Mademoiselle Mabry\" is a sprawling ode to both Miles' new girl and Hendrix's \"The Wind Cries Mary.\" Miles had started using electric keyboards in the studio almost exclusively by that time, and Corea's relatively conservative figures (when they aren't directly quoting the Hendrix tune), are the dominant timbre in this piece at first. He hadn't picked up the Fender Rhodes piano that would color almost every tune Miles performed thereafter, and the primitive sounds produced here betray the band's uncertainty about where the tune (or their sound) was going. Davis takes the first solo, similar to his exploratory efforts on Miles in the Sky earlier that year, over a non-groove from Williams' toms and Holland's steady, if rather static, low-end line. One of the reasons sets like this are great is that you really get a feeling for the musicians' progress during that time, and if this tune is any indication, things had only just begun to get interesting.</p><p>\"Frelon Brun\" gives a much better idea of the revolutionary sounds ahead. Williams wastes no time in hammering out a hard funk break from the kit, and Corea had apparently already learned the importance of the repetitive chordal vamp to this music. Davis takes a short solo, as if testing the waters, which is followed by Shorter's seemingly more confident strides in funky acid soul. The music actually ends up closer to what the band played after Bitches Brew than anything on In a Silent Way. Two months later, Miles reconvened with the same musicians, adding Herbie Hancock on Rhodes to form a sextet, to begin the next phase of the trip. The band played music closer to Miles' vision on \"Two Faced\": mystical, impressionistic soundscapes courtesy of the two-keyboard attack, subtle, though insistent drumming from Williams, and a by-then typically moaning, weary head covered by Davis and Shorter. The band was also not afraid of stretching the tunes out to 10, 15, or 20 minutes if it meant they'd find something useful along the way.</p><p>Miles (with the help of producer Teo Macero) had discovered tape edits from progressive pop records of the time (Sgt. Pepper being a chief influence), and this tune, similar to \"Shhh/Peaceful\" and \"In a Silent Way/It's About That Time,\" was constructed from several stop/start fragments. Later the same month, Miles found yet another missing ingredient in keyboardist (and über-influence on the sound of all resulting jazz-rock fusion) Joe Zawinul. The two men had known each other for several years prior to these sessions, but Miles could only admire the Austrian's playing from afar. Zawinul had made great strides in uniting jazz and soul with Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley's band in the mid-60s, even scoring a pop hit with \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.\" He also brought an earthy sense of melody and classicism to the mix, and would ultimately become a major architect for the sound of Miles' band. \"Splashdown,\" a previously unreleased piece of tense, Rhodes-led jazz-funk, was recorded with the first three-keyboard version of the band. However, Zawinul's influence wasn't really apparent until sessions from a couple of days later, when the band played two of his compositions: \"Ascent\" and the subsequent concert staple, \"Directions.\" The former seemingly caught the band in transition, with its theretofore-unprecedented use of tonal clusters and rootless \"comping\" from the keyboards, and an absence of any drum pattern at all, save an odd tambourine pulse. \"Directions\" was another story altogether, as the band busts out of the peaceful into the wild. This was the most \"rock\" Miles Davis had sounded like up to that point, and the two versions of the tune on this set are very similar to what Miles' concerts would sound like from '69 through the early 70s. Also of note on this session is that drummer Jack DeJohnette made his first appearance with a Miles Davis band in the studio, lending his distinct, high-energy stomp to the proceedings.</p><p>The band went on the road for a few months after that, and returned to the studio in February 1969. More changes: John McLaughlin had been recruited on guitar (another Tony Williams recommendation), and Williams had returned on drums. This time around, Miles was looking for what he called a \"groove album.\" The strategy was that the band would play a tune (on this session, \"Shhh/Peaceful\" and \"In a Silent Way\"), based on charts, but were free to explore what regions the performance yielded to them. Afterwards, Miles and Teo would evaluate the pieces, and form the \"groove\" in Miles' head from whatever was on tape.</p><p>The original, previously unreleased version of \"Shhh/Peaceful\" from that session will shock most people accustomed to the legendary In a Silent Way version. First of all, there's an exposition and melodic theme that was completely discarded in the proper version. Also, the famous robotic hi-hat pattern doesn't even begin until almost five minutes in. One of the surprises (some might even say disappointments) of this set is the realization that this music wasn't just the product of Miles' muse; there were hours of sessions and rehearsals before the band, Miles and Teo discovered what it was they were looking for. The humble beginnings of this tune still have much in common with straight jazz, though with a markedly progressive bent.</p><p>The same session yielded two versions of \"In a Silent Way.\" The first is very different to what ended up on the album, with a faux-bossanova beat and Holland's light-footed bassline supporting the classic melody line. The second version is the version that was used on the album, with McLaughlin's heavenly solo statement of the main theme, and Miles' delicate answer. The band also performed \"It's About That Time\" (definitely a fruitful afternoon) in what was essentially the final version, complete with tape edits and loops compiled by Teo. Two days later, Miles was back in the studio. He had a couple of new pieces, \"The Ghetto Walk\" and \"Early Minor,\" neither of which ended up on In a Silent Way. The first tune is a hard funk almost-blues featuring Joe Chambers laying down a slinky groove on drums, while McLaughlin, Shorter and Miles give up equally subversive solos. Most interesting is the middle section trip-down, wherein the ghost of the session two days prior sneaks in with a little atmospheric feather float. \"Early Minor\" is another Zawinul original that's indicative of the kind of hyper-impressionism he would play (with Shorter) with Weather Report shortly after making Bitches Brew with Miles. It's also confusing as to just why this didn't make the cut for the original In a Silent Way release, because it features similar cascading Rhodes figures, and very nice, gentle pulse keeping by Chambers.</p><p>The set ends with the LP versions of \"Shhh/Peaceful\" and \"In a Silent Way/It's About That Time.\" Miles fans didn't get to hear everything that came in between this album and its predecessor, so the sessions documented on this collection will make the leap from the cautious dabbling in rock textures of Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro to the full-blown jazz-opera of Bitches Brew. These recordings seem a lot more logically arranged and planned. This is good and bad: while few people would doubt the genius of Miles Davis as a player, composer and bandleader, it's evident that he was running on blind faith more than once during that time, and that he was learning on the go as much as his sidemen were. Part of the mystique surrounding this album, for me, has always been that it seemed to come out of nowhere, like a beacon of uncanny originality and visionary foresight. Apparently, it did have roots, and while the music will always be some of my favorite from Miles, I can't honestly say that seeing the blueprints for his magic translates to the same sheer joy as did the end results. But, it's still magic music, and it's still Miles. The worst thing you could ever say about a set like this is that it's almost too educational, and of course, that's not really a criticism, is it?</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Dominique Leone, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Thought by many to be among the most revolutionary albums in jazz history, Miles Davis' Bitches Brew solidified the genre known as jazz-rock fusion. The original double LP included only six cuts and featured up to 12 musicians at any given time, some of whom were already established while others would become high-profile players later, Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Airto, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, Don Alias, Bennie Maupin, Larry Young, and Lenny White among them. Originally thought to be a series of long jams locked into grooves around keyboard, bass, or guitar vamps, Bitches Brew is actually a recording that producer Teo Macero assembled from various jams and takes by razor blade, splice to splice, section to section. \"Pharaoh's Dance\" opens the set with its slippery trumpet lines, McLaughlin's snaky guitar figures skirting the edge of the rhythm section and Don Alias' conga slipping through the middle. Corea and Zawinul's keyboards create a haunted, riffing modal groove, echoed and accented by the basses of Harvey Brooks and Holland. The title cut was originally composed as a five-part suite, though only three were used. Here the keyboards punch through the mix and big chords ring up distorted harmonics for Davis to solo rhythmically over, outside the mode. McLaughlin's comping creates a vamp, and the bass and drums carry the rest. It's a small taste of the deep voodoo funk to appear on Davis' later records. Side three opens with McLaughlin and Davis trading fours and eights over a lockstep hypnotic vamp on \"Spanish Key.\" Zawinul's lyric sensibility provides a near chorus for Corea to flit around in; the congas and drummers juxtapose themselves against the basslines. It nearly segues into the brief \"John McLaughlin,\" featuring an organ playing modes below arpeggiated blues guitar runs. The end of Bitches Brew, signified by the stellar \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,\" reflects the influence of Jimi Hendrix with its chunky, slipped chords and Davis playing a ghostly melody through the funkiness of the rhythm section. It seemingly dances, becoming increasingly more chaotic until it nearly disintegrates before shimmering into a loose foggy nadir. The disc closes with \"Sanctuary,\" completely redone here as a moody electric ballad that was reworked for this band while keeping enough of its integrity to be recognizable. Bitches Brew is so forward-thinking that it retains its freshness and mystery in the 21st century.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Until now, the official recordings of Miles Davis' performances at the Fillmore East between June 17 and 20, 1970 have been limited to Miles at the Fillmore, released as a double-disc. That album's producer Teo Macero edited the recordings to create medleys of each night's music to four 20-minute selections. This four-disc set contains the full concerts. There are 100 minutes of previously unreleased music from Wednesday through Saturday, and an additional 35 minutes of unreleased music from a previous gig at the Fillmore West.</p><p>These concerts featured the Davis band opening for songwriter Laura Nyro. Bill Graham regularly booked jazz acts to play on bills with rock and pop acts. The rock-pop context is significant because Davis was actively courting that audience &mdash; aided not only by Graham but by FM DJs playing the just-released Bitches Brew. The band &mdash; saxophonist Steve Grossman, Dave Holland on electric bass, drummer Jack DeJohnette, percussionist Airto Moreira, Chick Corea on electric piano, and Keith Jarrett on organ &mdash; was loud and driving, and its sound was drenched in wah-wah pedals; distortion was employed when necessary. Both keyboardists played in the group for only three months. The program for each evening was basically the same: \"Directions,\" \"The Mask,\" \"It's About That Time,\" \"Bitches Brew,\" and \"The Theme.\" But each disc offers a different bonus: an encore, an unexpected performance, or tracks from the Fillmore West.</p><p>The charts are loose but focused, and the group's improvisational dynamic is breathtaking and entirely different each night. Davis is exceptionally strong. His playing is inventive, full of questions and muscular statements. Some notable solos occur on Wednesday's \"It's About That Time,\" the Fillmore West's \"Footprints\" and \"Paraphernalia,\" and the searing intensity displayed on \"Directions,\" from Friday. Grossman's soprano playing is stunning on each version of \"Bitches Brew\"; his bluesy tenor playing is at its best on Thursday's \"Spanish Key.\" Individually and collectively, DeJohnette and Holland add an extreme funkiness to the band's bottom. Their interplay is canny, full of unlikely yet nasty grooves &mdash; check Thursday's \"The Mask,\" or the throbbing pulse and roiling breaks on Friday's \"Directions.\" Jarrett's colors, textures, and stabs add an entirely different dimension to the band's attack. Check the spooky, sinister vamping and soloing on \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\" from the Fillmore West. Corea is alternately knotty and atmospheric. He can push the horns hard &mdash; listen to Thursday's \"Directions\" &mdash; or paint through Jarrett's wah-wah organ with an expressionist brush &mdash; as on Saturday's \"Willie Nelson\" &mdash; and his solos are risky. Airto's vocal and percussion arsenal is wildly different, not only from tune to tune, but night to night!</p><p>The sound here is fantastic: balanced and detailed. The box includes a 28-page booklet with an essay by Michael Cuscuna and producer's notes with Richard Seidel, along with rare photographs and a poster. Miles at the Fillmore - Miles Davis 1970: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 3 is an essential addition to the Davis canon.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Miles Davis hated stasis. In the 30-year period between the time he first gained notice playing bebop with Charlie Parker to when he retired for five years in 1975, his music was usually in a state of transformation, with steady but noticeable changes occasionally interrupted by moments of what, in another context, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called \"punctuated equilibrium.\" The shifts were not linear and could never be understood in terms of \"progression.\" Explorations into impressionist harmony, modal improvisation, pastoral sound-painting, neoclassical orchestration, abstract funk, and sheets of electronic noise weren't experienced as one music building on top of another, but rather a constant search for the possibilities lurking in the unknown. As the years wore on, Miles' own fear of irrelevance kept him working with players many years younger than himself so he was being exposed to new ideas without feeling the need to chase trends (most major jazz figures with an interest in experimentation made some overtures toward free jazz in the 1960s but Miles never did). All of which is to say that when you contemplate a single, narrow segment of Miles' brilliant and varied career, there's no telling what the music is going to give you until you immerse yourself in it. You have to look at where it came from and where it would go next.</p><p>Miles at the Fillmore, the latest entry in Columbia's revelatory bootleg series collecting unreleased Miles Davis live material, finds the trumpeter departing one musical world and entering a new one. In the previous five years, he'd taken the music of the Second Great Quintet (Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams) as far as it could go; hearing new music in his head, music that had never been made before, Miles fully embraced electric instruments on the dual landmarks In a Silent Way and, a year later, in April 1970, Bitches Brew; most of this set was recorded in June of that year. By this point in a very busy year of live performances, Bitches Brew was in stores and selling well and making waves, and Miles and his band were playing large rock venues, landing on the same bills as the Grateful Dead and Neil Young.</p><p>Some of this material has been released in a different form. These four discs each contain an evening's set, recorded on four consecutive nights in New York at the Fillmore East (live albums during this time can get confusing&mdash;Miles also recorded in April 1970 at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and some of that material, in far poorer sound quality, is included as bonus tracks). On the 1970 2xLP Miles Davis at Fillmore, each night was condensed and edited by Teo Macero into an approximately 25-minute collage to fit a single album side and given an overarching title without identifying individual pieces (\"Wednesday Miles\", \"Thursday Miles\", etc.) That decision foreshadowed what was to come with Miles' live sets through the rest of the 1970s, as written compositions and themes were considered only as additional elements to be swirled into process-oriented whole, and needn't necessarily be identified.</p><p>Compared to where his music would take in the ensuing four years, Miles' sound in mid–1970 was still loosely tethered to jazz tradition. There are distinct compositions that unfold with a set arc, there are recognizable themes, there's still a standard in regular rotation. And unlike his music in 1974 and '75, Miles Davis' trumpet is very much the focus, and his tone was strong and forceful and could easily cut through the electronic din. There are two keyboard players here, both of whom would go on to become hugely popular in the 1970s: Keith Jarrett (organ) and Chick Corea (electric piano). With no guitarist in the band, Jarrett and Corea are responsible for the electronics, and each plays his instrument in ways that go well beyond its intended use; Jarrett's squawking solos are often harsh and noisy, reminiscent of electric guitar, while Corea's electric piano gives the music a sense of disembodied drift. Dave Holland's basslines are simple ostinatos but feel more connected to jazz proper than the minimal funk Michael Henderson would bring a short time later. Saxophonist Steve Grossman serves a more functional role, with solid workmanlike solos that mostly serve to make Miles' time out front that much more exciting. And Jack DeJohnette's drumming alternates between forward-driving and hard-hitting funk/rock and pure texture during more abstract passages. DeJohnette's contributions underscore the defining quality of the music here: it's relentless energy.</p><p>The opener for each night, the Joe Zawinul composition \"Directions\", sets the bar very high in this department. It's built around a brilliantly simple bassline and has a classic theme that only shows up later in the piece, signaling when to pass the soloing baton to the next player. Miles would lose interest in this sort of structure over the next couple of years, but \"Directions\" is the perfect tune for him at this moment, and hearing the four show kick-offs in one place provides an opportunity to see how pieces varied from night to night. Wednesday night absolutely rips, as Holland's bass refrain drives the song forward almost faster than the band wants to go. Thursday is comparatively mellow and exploratory, allowing for more space. On Friday DeJohnette takes a less polyrhythmic approach to drums and Miles is more fluid and less intense in his soloing. And then Saturday is lighter and trickier, with more quick rhythmic interplay. The set lists each night were almost identical&mdash;\"The Mask\", \"It's About That Time\", \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\", and \"Bitches Brew\" are all heard in multiple versions&mdash;but jumping to different takes from disc-to-disc never feels redundant, such is the invention and variation with each performance.</p><p>Each phase of Miles Davis' development calls for a different kind of listening. Both 1969 and 1970, to my ears, are more accessible than the late-period material with the second quintet, with its unusual harmonies and deceptive structure. Nefertiti from 1967 truly feels like a puzzle, something I'll be working to understand forever, but the appeal of the Miles at the Fillmore material is obvious: This is an amazing band and they rip, but they never leave traditional ideas of rhythm and melody behind. There are extended soundscape passages in \"Bitches Brew\" and \"The Mask\" that are more about experiments in timbre, exploring how jazz improvisation can become the furthest-out space music possible, but the best of this set comes in hearing these players creating a new sound that remains immediate. You're hearing jazz form straining against its enclosure, and soon enough, it would be abandoned&mdash;by 1974, another key era, musicality would not be a priority, as black-hole-level density took over completely. Any notion of mainstream acceptance was pretty much gone by then, and Miles and his band were doing brilliant things with that freedom. Here they're doing equally brilliant things within certain strictures, making up a few rules and bending a few others to the breaking point.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

(Some of those tracks were previously released on compilations like Big Fun and Circle in the Round, but almost one-third of the material lay unissued until this release.) The music is simply fabulous -- the simultaneous birth and peak of jazz-rock/fusion, with a host of major players (John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Jack DeJohnette) and many innovations. There is a bit more evidence of tape hiss than in Columbia's last American remastering of the album, but the revelations of depth and timbre more than make up for it. Though the unreleased selections are distinctly inferior to those released on Bitches Brew, \"Yaphet,\" \"Corrado,\" and \"Trevere\" are intriguing jam sessions that reveal much about the creative process between Davis and producer Teo Macero during recording. Unlike Columbia's previous sets in the series (one treating Miles' period of collaboration with Gil Evans and one featuring the music of his second classic quintet), the Bitches Brew sessions lend themselves well to a box set of this type -- presenting the music in chronological order does no harm to original LP configurations as it did on previous sets, and the music here is another glowing testament to Miles' importance to the development of jazz in 1969, as in 1949.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>John Bush</strong></p>"

Most of the outtake material ended up on Directions, Big Fun, and elsewhere. The first misconception is the lineup: the credits on the recording are incomplete. For the opener, \"Right Off,\" the band is Miles, John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, Herbie Hancock, Michael Henderson, and Steve Grossman (no piano player!), which reflects the liner notes. This was from the musicians' point of view, in a single take, recorded as McLaughlin began riffing in the studio while waiting for Miles; it was picked up on by Henderson and Cobham, Hancock was ushered in to jump on a Hammond organ (he was passing through the building), and Miles rushed in at 2:19 and proceeded to play one of the longest, funkiest, knottiest, and most complex solos of his career. Seldom has he cut loose like that and played in the high register with such a full sound. In the meantime, the interplay between Cobham, McLaughlin, and Henderson is out of the box, McLaughlin playing long, angular chords centering around E. This was funky, dirty rock & roll jazz. There is this groove that gets nastier and nastier as the track carries on, and never quits, though there are insertions by Macero of two Miles takes on Sly Stone tunes and an ambient textured section before the band comes back with the groove, fires it up again, and carries it out. On \"Yesternow,\" the case is far more complex. There are two lineups, the one mentioned above, and one that begins at about 12:55. The second lineup was Miles, McLaughlin, Jack DeJohnette, Chick Corea, Bennie Maupin, Dave Holland, and Sonny Sharrock. The first 12 minutes of the tune revolve around a single bass riff lifted from James Brown's \"Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.\" The material that eases the first half of the tune into the second is taken from \"Shhh/Peaceful,\" from In a Silent Way, overdubbed with the same trumpet solo that is in the ambient section of \"Right Off.\" It gets more complex as the original lineup is dubbed back in with a section from Miles' tune \"Willie Nelson,\" another part of the ambient section of \"Right Off,\" and an orchestral bit of \"The Man Nobody Saw\" at 23:52, before the voice of Jack Johnson (by actor Brock Peters) takes the piece out. The highly textured, nearly pastoral ambience at the end of the album is a fitting coda to the chilling, overall high-energy rockist stance of the album. Jack Johnson is the purest electric jazz record ever made because of the feeling of spontaneity and freedom it evokes in the listener, for the stellar and inspiring solos by McLaughlin and Davis that blur all edges between the two musics, and for the tireless perfection of the studio assemblage by Miles and producer Macero.

The first 12 minutes of the tune revolve around a single bass riff lifted from James Brown's \"Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.\" The material that eases the first half of the tune into the second is taken from \"Shhh/Peaceful,\" from In a Silent Way, overdubbed with the same trumpet solo that is in the ambient section of \"Right Off.\" It gets more complex as the original lineup is dubbed back in with a section from Davis' tune \"Willie Nelson,\" another part of the ambient section of \"Right Off,\" and an orchestral bit of \"The Man Nobody Saw\" at 23:52, before the voice of Jack Johnson (by actor Brock Peters) takes the piece out. The highly textured, nearly pastoral ambience at the end of the album is a fitting coda to the chilling, overall high-energy rockist stance of the album. Jack Johnson is the purest electric jazz record ever made because of the feeling of spontaneity and freedom it evokes in the listener, for the stellar and inspiring solos by McLaughlin and Davis that blur all edges between the two musics, and for the tireless perfection of the studio assemblage by Miles and producer Macero.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The first in a continuing series of double-LP extravaganzas released only in Japan in the early '70s, Live-Evil mixes four studio tracks from 1970 with four live ones taken from a Washington, D.C. performance in December of that year. Amidst heavy competition, the live tracks -- including \"What I Say,\" \"Sivad\" and \"Gemini Double Image\" -- are the highlights, featuring some of Miles' best playing of the decade, plus aggressive work on extended solo spots by John McLaughlin on guitar, Keith Jarrett on keyboards, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. Alternating chaotic deep-groove passages with a few more atmospheric, Live-Evil held up for two decades as one of the great import-only Miles Davis albums, until it was reissued in America by Columbia/Legacy in 1997</p><p>&mdash; <strong>John Bush</strong></p><hr/><p>Firing like a machine gun over a heavily armored and equipped outfit of young, brawny assassins, Miles Davis ruled the world at the end of 1970. A year removed from his \"corruption\" at the hands of rock-- if you believe dozens of decaying jazz critics, that is-- Davis had the band and the vision to play music that no one would ever play again. His arsenal: \"Directions\", \"What I Saw\", \"Honky Tonk\", \"Inamorata\", \"It's About That Time\"; with only Joe Zawinul's \"Directions\" having been played by any of Davis' groups before, the trumpeter had to know he was making a statement. In fact, none of the new stuff had more than a few notes, a couple of chord changes to distinguish it from \"formless jamming\" (to borrow another phrase from a critic), and if fans thought Bitches Brew was out there, what would they make of this? A few months removed from playing to 600,000 at the Isle of Wight, Davis had the nerve to hole up at The Cellar Door in Washington D.C., a small club holding no more than a couple hundred people.</p><p>And he killed them. He and his band launched bomb after bomb for four nights; he slew every last person at the show, and listening to this noise now, it makes me want to kick the nonbelievers in the teeth.     Fans will already know some of the music on the overwhelming 6xCD The Cellar Door Sessions 1970 because much of its final disc (from the band's last date at the club) was issued on 1971's Live-Evil. Of course, it was cut-up, rearranged, and interspersed with studio tracks, so even familiar performances sound new here. The box contains six of the 10 sets Davis' band played, remixed and sounding great (especially via an increased presence from Michael Henderson's bass), and extensive notes from everyone who played there-- except Davis. It's a shame we don't know what the band's leader thought of this stuff, because there is a case to be made that Henderson, drummer Jack DeJohnette, saxophonist Gary Bartz, keyboardist Keith Jarrett, and Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira comprised his last indisputably great band. When guitarist John McLaughlin shows up for the last set, things seems even more fiery, more volatile, and I always have to fight the urge to blast my neighbors into next week.</p><p>In any case, I can only guess Davis was pleased-- in fact, he leaves most of the lengthy solo pace to his bandmates, content to let this stew brew and brew and brew.</p><p>The first disc (from the band's first set on Wednesday night) begins right on Davis' solo from \"Directions\". DeJohnette is already playing like a motherfucker, nailing polyrhythms straight out of a drum'n'bass tune, and Davis flutters from behind a wah-wah pedal in turn. When he removes the effect, he plays high-pitched jabs-- a favorite move at the time-- and mixes in some furious runs, the kind he was gradually learning to leave behind as his music became more aggressive, more primal, LESS JAZZ. On the spacious \"Yesternow\" (originally from the Jack Johnson LP), the band stretches out. Nevertheless, Davis' solo is a strident mix of punches and runs, with Jarrett echoing him on the left after each phrase. Jarrett had already lit the fire under the track during his lengthy intro solo-- in fact, he was given a very long leash during these dates, frequently being allotted complete freedom to bring in tracks with unaccompanied performances.</p><p>The band closes shop with the funked-out \"Inamorata\" and Davis' screaming melody. We're just getting started.     The second disc, from the next night, begins with DeJohnette's deft pulse on \"What I Say\", Henderson hitting the downbeats like a rock. Jarrett again begins things with a flighty, short-breathed solo on electric piano before Davis comes in with the piercing \"melody\" (which is mostly more high-note jabs that I imagine took out the eyes of the first row of club patrons). Bartz takes off after a particularly agitated Davis solo, and the tune seems to jump into another gear altogether-- and the audience responds in kind with the first of many animated reactions to his solos. On \"Honky Tonk\", something of a gospel blues vamp, the band brings everything way down, as Henderson plays the main riff under Jarrett's shimmering piano asides. Davis' solo afterwards sounds almost suffocated by the dirge of a pulse, but given that remainder of the band's set featured blow-outs like \"It's About That Time\" (here, with an unbelievably funky coda) and \"Inamorata\", he may just have been venting his anticipation.</p><p>Friday night's shows are spread over discs 3 and 4, the first of which contains epic versions of \"What I Say\", \"Directions\", and \"Honky Tonk\". I should note that the band never sounds out of breath in the slightest. Moreira's cuica squeak is all over the intro, as if chomping at the bit to let the floodgates open; Davis comes in about three minutes into the tune, nailing a wailing pitch into his solo and taking flight with a runs as if this was the first shot he'd ever gotten to play this stuff. Likewise, Jarrett's opening solo on \"Honky Tonk\" runs the gamut from blues, to modern jazz to an early run at the kind of exploratory impressionism he'd play on his own The Köln Concert years later-- these guys held a grand total of zero back. \"Inamorata\" from the fourth disc winds up for a minute before launching its main riff, as if the band were stretching its collective muscles and firing one last silo before disappearing into the night. Davis crawls out from between the twin locomotives of DeJohnnette and Henderson with a wah-wah'd solo, and it's obvious they probably could have gone on for hours.     </p><p>The Saturday night shows on discs 5 and 6, and the introduction of guitarist McLaughlin (whose late flight only allowed him to make the tail end of their gigs), brings home an abundantly clear point: This period was apex for Davis and his band. Reissue co-producer Adam Holzman makes the point that this music was a sort of end-game for Davis' Bitches Brew ideas, before leaping off into the funky underworlds of On the Corner and the hazy, quasi-psychedelic shows of his touring band from 1973-75. McLaughlin's jaw-dropping solo on \"Directions\" from the last disc serves notice to anyone who forgot that Davis really did want to play rock music, but with the intelligence and technique of jazz. It's tough to find very many examples on record of people playing with as much intensity or inspiration. Funny enough, some of the guys mention in the box's notes that they weren't quite sure what to expect with McLaughlin's arrival. I guess it only goes to show you can't stop genius in the making. In December 1970, you couldn't stop Miles Davis.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Dominique Leone, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Of all the Miles Davis recordings, the 16 weeks of sessions that created a single, two-selection LP produced by Teo Macero called A Tribute to Jack Johnson have been the most apocryphal. While the album itself was a confounding obscurity upon release — due to its closeness in proximity to the nearly simultaneous release of the vastly inferior yet infinitely more label-promoted Live at the Fillmore East — its reputation as the first complete fusion of jazz and rock is cemented. It also garnered a place in the history books for guitarist John McLaughlin, the axis around whose raw, slash-and-burn playing, the entire album turns.</p><p>The five-CD Complete Jack Johnson Sessions set, covering February 18 to June 4 of 1970, reveals that a revolving cast of musicians entered the Davis/Macero music and sound lab and made a series of mind-bending, often inspired — yet sometimes maddeningly monotonous — recording dates, where the creation of backbeat-driven grooves and short, rhythmic, rock- and funk-inflected riffs were the only ideas presented by Davis; everything else flowed freely, for better or worse. No less than five albums have benefited from these sessions: the others include Live-Evil, Get Up With It, Directions, and Big Fun. The two cuts that make up A Tribute to Jack Johnson, \"Right Off\" and \"Yesternow,\" make up the last two selections on disc five. The arrangement of the session is basically chronological. Thus, there are not only numerous takes of a composition but insertion and remake takes as well. For instance, there are two takes of \"Willie Nelson,\" two inserted \"versions,\" and two remakes, all sequenced here in a row. Likewise is the strange genesis, deconstruction, and rebirth of \"Go Ahead John,\" which appeared in this form on Big Fun. Still, despite the hypnotic grooves where already elongated tunes turn into monolithic groove structures, the historical importance of these sessions, and the sheer listening pleasure they provide in doses, cannot be overestimated.</p><p>There are 17 previously unissued performances here, 14 takes, and alternates that have never been issued in full form! As a small example, the official unearthing of the \"Duran\" alternate take offers so much more in terms of different instrumentation (many alternates here provide this) and ambience than the circulated version that it is nearly a different tune altogether. The roots of \"Right Off\" and \"Yesternow,\" which appear on disc three, compare to the final heavily edited versions on the album as startlingly different compositions. Evolution becomes not only the crux of the Davis sessions, but a whole new way of making jazz records. These sides reveal how, decades later, Davis's own playing remains firmly committed to the jazz ideal as a soloist despite the fact that McLaughlin and others such as Bennie Maupin, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Jack DeJohnette, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Steve Grossman, Michael Henderson, Ron Carter, Sonny Sharrock, Airto, Dave Holland, and Hermeto Pascoal were essentially playing jam- and groove-based rock.</p><p>The role of guitarist Sonny Sharrock is finally defined here. It has previously been discounted and provided endless grist for the Davis rumor mill how he was mixed out of the session. Yes, he was, but so was almost everyone but McLaughlin and Miles at one point or another. Check out Sharrock's killer slide playing that appears on the second inset of \"Willie Nelson.\" For those who worship at the McLaughlin altar, there are the extra minutes of screaming, fuzz-drenched wailing on \"Right Off\" that were left on the floor by Macero. But this set is full of moments like that, such as the previously unreleased \"Sugar Ray,\" a futuristic look at electronic noise — with rhythm — as jazz.</p><p>It is true that attempting to listen to this as a box is an admittedly long, arduous, and sometimes difficult task. Taking on individual pieces, in a changer, or even a disc at a time, is a deeply engaging, provocative listening experience. If any recordings needed to be released in order to document the perfect fusion of jazz and rock — in addition to Miles' musical and studio development — it's these.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>In the spring of 1970, Miles Davis was fresh off his trailblazing, artistic watermarks In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, and focusing on the development of his live show.  His band included     some of the greatest session musicians in jazz at the time: bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, and drummer Jack DeJohnette, and all were helping Miles to push the musical ideas he'd introduced on his records into uncharted territory in concert.  But he was also very much inspired by the concept of using recording studios as compositional instruments, and when he set out to create the soundtrack to an obscure documentary on boxing icon Jack Johnson, it turned out he had many more ideas than could possibly find their way onto two sides of a single LP.</p><p>Following in the vein of Miles' recently issued Complete Sessions box sets for In a Silent Way or Bitches Brew (and featuring more raw material than either), this new five-disc collection shows a man consumed with evaluating the arsenal at his disposal.  That meant recording countless takes on a theme, and, with assistance from producer Teo Macero, splicing those takes together into one coherent 40-minute release: 1971's A Tribute to Jack Johnson.  But now, this compilation documents the sessions in their virtual entirety (there are a couple of missing takes, but nothing too essential),     offering an incredible six hours of largely unheard material.  As with the previous boxes from this era,     fans will delight in hearing just about everything the musicians put to tape, as well as paging through     the invaluable session info, extensive liner notes, and unseen photos included in the extensive and     beautiful packaging.  Obviously, though, anyone who hasn't heard and loved the original Jack Johnson     album should check that out before dropping $60 on this exhaustive collection.</p><p>Disc one opens with several takes from a February 1970 session of the misleadingly titled \"Willie Nelson\" (it is, in fact, a Miles Davis original)-- much of which was incorporated into the original LP's largely ambient piece \"Yesternow\".  The band, which here features Miles, Corea, Holland, DeJohnette, bass clarinetist Bernie Maupin, and guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, set up a downbeat-heavy groove that reminds me of Funkadelic's \"Music for Your Mother\", if much less drugged-out.  Davis enters about 40 seconds into \"Willie Nelson (Take 2)\" with a typically elongated phrase before settling into his \"jab\" motif with Maupin.  Each take of the song offered here center around melodies similar to this one-- the real differences lie in Sharrock's, Miles' and Maupin's solos.  It's a great way to kick off the set, if not quite as fiery a start as the original LP's \"Right Off\".</p><p>Later that month, Miles reconvened with a smaller band, keeping his rhythm section fully intact, but trading in Sharrock, Corea and Maupin for 19-year-old saxophonist Steve Grossman.  They recorded a couple of speedier takes of \"Willie Nelson\" that boast more colorful McLaughlin lines and Grossman's pleasantly spooky soprano.  Miles also gives some great solos, even sporting some of his bebop chops at times-- sax player Gary Bartz, a member of Charles Mingus' Jazz Workshop and soloist on Miles' Live/Evil, said that some of the most exciting moments during the shows that eventually comprised the 1974 live offering Dark Magus were when Miles would reach back into history to pull out some of his old runs, and they certainly shine here.  This band also tries out three versions of a tune called \"Johnny Bratton\" (previously unreleased, and starting the run of songs titled after boxers), a very rock-centric piece that sounds a bit like they were unsure of how to really nail this style.  \"Johnny Bratton (Insert 1)\" is basically straight-ahead rock pounding (something like a fusion approximation of \"Louie, Louie\") with McLauglin doing his best to ensure that any tonal center is wiped out, and Holland entering with some admirable fuzz-wah bass playing.</p><p>In early March, Miles again headed into the studio with this same band to cut \"Archie Moore\" and several versions of \"Go Ahead John\".  The former tune is a hard blues number with some very potent lines from McLaughlin-- in fact, Miles and Grossman sit this one out entirely, allowing the trio to bring it home like a seasoned rock band.  Five takes of \"Go Ahead John\" pop up on disc two, showcasing Miles' midnight cool melody.  The first part is a sparse, somber exercise in minimal blues, and features McLaughlin reeling off short, staccato statements similar to the ones played by Sharrock on the first disc.  The second part of the tune is an odd combination of jittery funk and acid-rock, with DeJohnette playing a prehistoric drum-n-bass pattern and Holland holding a single bass note while McLaughlin shreds on the right.  All five performances were later edited into a version released on 1974's Big Fun.</p><p>Mid-March saw Miles lay down two takes of the previously unissued \"Duran\" with McLaughlin, Holland, Maupin, soprano saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and drummer Billy Cobham.  Miles' band was certainly getting a better idea of how to construct \"simple\" funk, as the basic, syncopated groove here could have been played (though never written) by any number of funk bands at the time.  However, the robo-tight interplay of Cobham and Holland, along with McLaughlin's ever-edgy solos, make it much more interesting than just any ordinary breakdown.  Miles reports, \"that's some raunchy shit, y'all,\" and he's right.  These guys (exit Cobham, enter future Return to Forever drummer Lenny White) also did the stop-time, angular funk tune \"Sugar Ray\", which Bill Mulkowski's liner notes curiously describe as \"Devoesque\" and \"proto-punk.\"  It sounds more like The Meters playing head games to me.</p><p>As April came around, Miles re-entered the studio with McLaughlin, Cobham, Grossman and Mike Henderson, a teenage bassist from Aretha Franklin's band, to record \"Right Off\" and the first half of \"Yesternow\". These two songs, of course, ended up serving as the tracklist on the original Jack Johnson LP, and anyone familiar with that record can attest to just how beautifully they pulled off \"Right Off\"'s uptempo shuffle, with McLaughlin's aggressive outcomping transforming the track from a merely interesting jazz experiment to full-on streetwise fusion.  Herbie Hancock dropped by the studio as well (from the grocery store!) and got talked into laying down a fuzz-fried solo on Farfisa, a kind of organ he'd never played before.  The track ended up purely celebratory, and the four takes on disc three provide just about every solo angle you could want.  The two lengthy takes of \"Yesternow\" offered here are masterful runs into electric ambience, but inevitably not quite as interesting as Macero's final album edit.</p><p>In May, Miles added Keith Jarrett and percussionist Airto Moreira to the mix, cutting versions of \"Honky Tonk\" and \"Ali\".  A short excerpt of \"Honky Tonk\" ended up on Live/Evil, but until now, the track has never been released in its entirety.  Shame, too, because it's an excellent slice of blues-rock: Miles plays with confidence using an octave pedal while McLaughlin peals out still more spiky color for Jarrett to run rampant over.  Considering that Jack Johnson would be Miles' last studio recording until     On the Corner over two years later, it's hard to believe this song wasn't issued somewhere along     the line.</p><p>\"Ali\", leading off disc four, sees the same band (here including longtime Elvin Jones collaborator     Gene Perla, who nicks a riff from Hendrix's \"Who Knows\") following a groove similar to that of \"Willie     Nelson\", but with a much better idea of how to flesh it out.  And then there's \"Konda\", which the guys     recorded without a bassist at all, and which didn't see release until 1981's Directions compilation.     Jarrett's opening solo on electric piano perfectly sets up Miles' eerie, beautiful melody, and McLaughlin's harmonic work is practically unearthly, helping to make this track one of the box set's coolest pieces. Miles followed this muse a few days later for takes on Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal's \"Nem Um Talvez\".     Neither of the versions here are the one from Live/Evil, though the second is remarkably close.</p><p>Miles wrapped recording in June, but not before taking most of the band from May's sessions (adding old     friends Hancock and bassist Ron Carter) back into the studio for one last go at \"Nem Um Talvez\", three other Pascoal pieces (\"Little High People\", \"Selim\", \"Little Church\"), and another Davis original titled \"The Mask\".  All of Pascoal's ballads seem to advance the side of Miles' music best heard on In a Silent Way, and serve notice to anyone who thought he'd abandoned that style for good at the turn of the decade.  Unfortunately, \"Little High People\" is almost distractingly straightforward, at least in principal: The uptempo pop/rock groove brings Hancock's organ transmissions down to earth, and keeps Miles' wah-wah solos a bit too in check.  Meanwhile, \"Selim\" (really just \"Nem Um Talvez\" with a different title) ended up on Live/Evil, along with the two versions of \"Little Church\" found on this set's fifth disc.  Dave Holland came back to the fold to record both parts of the previously unreleased \"The Mask\": the first is a very out, keyboard-heavy free-jam with little assistance from Miles or McLaughlin, while the second-- hardly easy listening-- closes the sessions with an exhausted, punchdrunk swagger, finally collapsing after nearly 16 minutes.</p><p>The box, however, ends on a high note, with the original LP versions of \"Right Off\" and \"Yesternow\". I hesitate to go through them blow by blow because anyone investing in this box will almost certainly have already heard them many times over.  Which, ultimately, is my only real caveat to The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions: there's more of interest here to fans; for a casual listener to tackle all five discs would be commendably ambitious, but an arduous challenge nonetheless.  This set ranks behind both the Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way boxes in terms of the amount of music I'd want to just let play, uninterrupted.  However, Miles Davis is one of those rare musicians who rarely failed to let a take pass without trying out something cool.  As usual, the deeper you dig, the more you find.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Dominique Leone, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Could there be any more confrontational sound in Miles Davis' vast catalog than the distorted guitars and tinny double-timing drums reacting to a two-note bass riff funking it up on the first track from On the Corner? Before the trumpet even enters the picture, the story has been broken off somewhere in the middle, with deep street music melding with a secret language held within the band and those who can actually hear this music — certainly not the majority of Miles' fan base built up over the past 25 years. They heard this as a huge \"f*ck you.\" Miles just shrugged and told them it wasn't personal, but they could take it that way if they wanted to, and he blew on his trumpet. Here are killer groove riffs that barely hold on as bleating trumpet and soprano sax lines (courtesy of Dave Liebman on track one) interact with John McLaughlin's distortion-box frenzy. Michael Henderson's bass keeps the basic so basic it hypnotizes; keyboards slowly enter the picture, a pair of them handled by Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, as well as Ivory Williams' synthesizer. Finally, Colin Walcott jumps in with an electric sitar and there are no less than five drummers — three kits (Al Foster, Billy Hart, and Jack DeJohnette), a tabla player, and Mtume.</p><p>It's a four-tune suite, <i>\"On the Corner\"</i> is, but the separations hardly matter, just the shifts in groove that alter the time/space continuum. After 20 minutes, the set feels over and a form of Miles' strange lyricism returns in \"Black Satin.\" Though a tabla kicks the tune off, there's a recognizable eight-note melody that runs throughout. Carlos Garnett and Bennie Maupin replace Liebman, Dave Creamer replaces McLaughlin, and the groove rides a bit easier — except for those hand bells shimmering in the background off the beat just enough to make the squares crazy. The respite is short-lived, however. Davis and band move the music way over to the funk side of the street — though the street funkers thought these cats were too weird with their stranded time signatures and modal fugues that begin and end nowhere and live for the way the riff breaks down into emptiness. \"One and One\" begins the new tale, so jazz breaks down and gets polished off and resurrected as a far blacker, deeper-than-blue character in the form of \"Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X,\" where guitars and horns careen off Henderson's cracking bass and Foster's skittering hi-hats. It may sound weird even today, but <i>On the Corner</i> is the most street record ever recorded by a jazz musician. And it still kicks.</p><p> &mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Miles Davis dropped jazz for good in late 1971&mdash;not that he'd been keeping up many appearances for the genre in several years. Though his band would still occasionally play old standards live, his main show in the early 70s was free-ish funk, openly indebted to Sly Stone and James Brown (and I still wonder what Davis would have made of Funkadelic). Of course, the maligned genre in question&mdash;jazz&mdash;was mostly the property of people writing about Davis, and in some cases, his still-jazz-oriented peers, so it's no surprise to read his bandmates of the time (percussionist Mtume, bassist Michael Henderson, guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas, drummer Al Foster, saxophonist Dave Liebman) refer back to those days with no small amount of pride, and scorn towards the ever-present \"critics\". The records Davis made during this time sounded raw (but weren't), hard (and were) and not the kind of thing that was going to fit into any particular canon, even as their maker adopted conscious efforts to position his music for younger, blacker audiences. And he might have dropped jazz, but he picked up something a lot more important: the future of music.</p><p>On the Corner was released in October 1972, followed by Big Fun and Get Up With It, both in 1974. All of these records contained (at least partially) music recorded during sessions in 1972-75, the period represented on Columbia Legacy's latest extravagant box-set treatment for Davis, The Complete On the Corner Sessions. Over six discs, we get every track put to tape during the period by Davis' revolving cast of players (in addition to the core of his touring band, luminous Davis alums like Chick Corea, Jack DeJohnette, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Don Alias, and Bennie Maupin drop by), and though I don't anticipate many all-night OtC listening parties in the near future, it's arguably the greatest collection of Davis' post-Bitches Brew studio music in one set. The thing is, this is thick, sticky stuff; 20-minute jams like \"Ife\" or the unedited take of \"On the Corner\" are amazingly gripping despite their lengths, but process a few in a row, and you risk experiencing dizzy spells. In retrospect, maybe it's not surprising that Davis retired in 1975, resurfacing half a decade later playing music that was a lot more easily digestible.</p><p>Since its 72 release, On the Corner (featured in full on the last disc in the box) has attained a level of infamy outmatching any of Davis' other records, though not really for the right reasons. Downbeat's equally infamous calling-out of its tunes as \"repetitious boredom\" unfortunately summed up the feeling of many folks who would have preferred to only remember Davis' music from the 50s and 60s. However, rock and experimental music fans weren't quite so dismissive&mdash;in fact, today, OtC is one of the easiest Davis records to recommend to a non-convert, especially if they're down with the wtf production and uber-grooved-out beats. Teo Macero's editing/splicing/midwifing of the myriad sessions that comprised the record were no less significant to its sound than Davis' pieces, and considering how records are made today, perhaps more so. Still, it's the avant-funk and druggy ambience that lingers longest. There's a reason people compare this stuff to Can.</p><p>Disc one features unedited takes of \"On the Corner\", \"One and One\", and \"Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X\", all of which would appear in messed-with form on the 1972 LP. And though *OtC'*s edits are a considerable part of its magic, the surprising thing with these tracks is how well they work as just jams (greatly assisted by the fact that in most cases, their signature hooks are intact, such as the hi-hat pulse in \"On the Corner\", or the classic sing-song melody in \"Helen Butte\"). \"Jabali\" is a previously unissued track, featuring a slow, lurching bassline from Henderson, and gradually picks up steam while simultaneously becoming more psychedelic (anyone order three extra keyboards?). The second disc begins with \"Ife\" (originally issued on Big Fun), and adds Paul Buckmaster on electric cello. Buckmaster's contribution to Davis' music at that time was considerable, especially via turning the trumpeter onto Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose use of recorded and electric sound had a big impact on the recording of OtC. \"Chieftan\" is a previously unissued, agitated vamp, featuring an insistent hi-hat + rim shot beat, augmented (like many tracks from this era) by tabla and sitar. \"Turnaround\" and \"U-Turnaround\" are also new tracks, but whose slow, heavy grooves would have sounded very at home on, say, Live-Evil or Dark Magus. \"Rated X\" (later on Get Up With It) is just a badass funk track that features some seriously distorted production, and should probably be sampled by all crate-digging, rare-grooves DJs ASAP.</p><p>Disc three begins with another track from Get Up With It (\"Billy Preston\"&mdash;not featuring Billy Preston btw), and several unissued tracks: the somewhat raucous, wah-wah guitar-powered \"The Hen\", two HUGE mixes of \"Big Fun/Holly-wuud\" (which would later be severed to make both sides of a 74 single), the skeletal, relatively restrained \"Peace\", and the funk dirge \"Mr. Foster\", which takes the basic groove of \"Big Fun\", and stretches it across 15 minutes of mournful vamping and uncharacteristically solemn solos from Liebman and Davis. Disc four contains the two epic-length tracks from Get Up With It, \"Calypso Frelimo\" and the Duke Ellington tribute, \"He Loved Him Madly\". The first piece begins as reverb-drenched, frantic funk, and moves into molasses-paced death groove (though still laced with reverb, as if recorded in a subway tunnel). I've never been a huge fan of \"He Loved Him Madly\", though its extended (30+ minutes) calm is a welcome respite from the otherwise merciless pace of the rest of the box.</p><p>\"Maiysha\" (also from Get Up With It) begins disc five, and though its major-key, curiously sprightly guitar figure seems a little out of place with generally darker (or more cynical) music on the other discs, it still retains the exotic flavor of the box's music. \"Mtume\" begins with&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;a conga solo by Davis' permanent conga player Mtume, and soon turns into an up-tempo Afro-Cuban groove with cool triple-guitar wah-ing from Lucas, Cosey and Dominique Gaumont. (A shorter outtake of the same track features a good soprano sax solo from Sonny Fortune.) The 19-minute blues-shuffle \"Hip Skip\" (with a pretty bizarre organ solo by Davis), frantic \"What They Do\" (reminiscent of the faster stuff on Dark Magus) and brief, strangely loungy \"Minnie\"&mdash;notable mostly for being recorded at Davis' last session in 1975 before his five-year retirement &mdash;are all previously unissued. The final disc of the box contains all of the OtC LP, in addition to a fairly straight blues on \"Red China Blues\" (from Get Up With It, and featuring the only harmonica solo I can remember hearing on a Davis track), and both sides of the \"Big Fun\"/\"Holly-wuud\" single.</p><p>So, here we are again, near the end of another year, with another indispensable Miles Davis box to purchase (which Columbia doubtlessly realizes, as the lofty $120+ price tag might indicate). Do you need it? If you're a die-hard, it's obvious: you do. If you've never heard On the Corner, it's obvious: you don't. However, you do need to buy OtC sooner than yesterday. Perhaps in six months or a year, after you've stopped annoying all your friends by telling them how great it is, then you can go back and order the box&mdash;by which time, should be available for about half of what is now. Davis saw the future with this music. Be smart, do the same.</p><p> &mdash; <strong>Dominique Leone</strong>"

		"review": "<p>Big Fun was roundly slagged off when it was issued in 1974 as holdover material from Bitches Brew. In fact, a lot of the double albums Miles was pumping out at the time were considered holdover material. In the case of this double reissue, that claim is partially true. The original Big Fun featured four side-long tracks: \"Great Expectations,\" \"Ife,\" \"Go Ahead John,\" and \"Lonely Fire,\" all of them recorded with different ensembles, three with 11-piece bands (which included Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Billy Cobham, Bennie Maupin, Larry Young, Ron Carter, Steve Grossman, Airto, Jack DeJohnette, and many others) and one — \"Go Ahead John\" — with a quintet. All of the material was recorded between 1969 and 1972. The four other tracks here, to round out this double-CD package, all appear on the four-CD Bitches Brew Sessions box set. They are \"Recollections,\" \"Trevere,\" \"The Little Blue Frog,\" and \"Yaphet.\" Some of these were recorded at the same time the original tracks had been and the ensembles match up, as on \"Great Expectations\" and \"Yaphet,\" and the pairing of \"The Little Blue Frog,\" \"Lonely Fire,\" and \"Trevere.\" What's wild is, even in the same sessions, there are differences in personnel. What all of this points to, other than the savvy of the reissue producers, is simple: Miles was restless his entire career, but never like he was when he discovered electricity. There is plenty of argument to suggest he never found what he was looking for but came very close numerous times. Here, as Miles breaks down the pedal points of his modal language to include Indian ragas — and the musicians who play them — as he does on Joe Zawinul's \"Great Expectations\" and his own \"Yaphet,\" \"Trevere,\" and \"Lonely Fire,\" Davis opens the door to allowing his musicians to play outside of any jazz convention and still stay plugged in as a band. Listen to John McLaughlin's playing here, with its chunky restraint and aplomb and then — as on the \"Go Ahead John\" quintet session — fire. There has never been another Miles solo like the one here either; multi-tracked and many-faceted, it is as if he carries within it the history of music in the world. Or pick up the slippery intertwining of Dave Holland's acoustic and Harvey Brooks' electric basses, creating whole-tone drones along with the sitars while pumping rhythmic invention toward the band. Ultimately, amid the drones and the funk, there is the particular brand of lyricism that belonged only to Miles Davis. Listening to either the four original tracks or the two CDs taken as a session edited for one album, it hardly matters — the deep hues and pleasant pastoral wonders that Big Fun provides are as moving, mysterious, and beautiful as anything Miles ever created.</p><p><b>&mdash; Thom Jurek</b></p>"

Using funky but unpredictable rhythm sections and leaving space for plenty of solos, Davis created a unique brand of fusion that has yet to be satisfactorily duplicated. Among his more notable sidemen during this era are altoist Kenny Garrett, Foley on lead bass (which he used as a lower-toned guitar), one or two keyboardists chosen from Joey DeFrancesco, Adam Holzman, Robert Irving III, Kei Akagi, and John Beasley, various bassists, drummers, and percussionists, and on \"Amandla,\" the tenor of Rick Margitza. Davis is in consistently strong form throughout the numbers, which include \"In a Silent Way,\" \"New Blues,\" \"Human Nature,\" \"Tutu,\" and \"Time After Time.\" Quite often the live versions of these songs are more creative and exciting than the ones previously issued. This highly recommended CD (released in 1996) concludes with one number (\"Hannibal\") from Davis' final performance; it is not given a date but is most likely from just a few weeks before his death at age 65.

Here, several dance producers are brought into the fold, not just to rearrange the material but to remix it as well. The versions that work the best are done by producers unafraid to tamper with the tapes: hence, two separate reworkings of \"Rated X\" (from Get Up with It) result in darkside drum'n'bass burners by Doc Scott and Jamie Myerson that find the hyperkinetic energy in the original. The highlight of the entire project is an inexplicably vinyl-only bonus track by DJ Krush, who turns \"Black Satin/On the Corner\" into a minimalist beat odyssey with several different passages and effective scratching in all the right places. The only real disappointment on Panthalassa: The Remixes finds trip-hop deconstructionist DJ Cam creating an uneasy alliance by crudely inserting a loping breakbeat onto Miles' winsome solo from \"In a Silent Way.\" Remix albums are often a mistake for both parties involved, but this one does work on several levels.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>John Bush</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This two-hour documentary was produced by Mike Dibb for the BBC's Channel Four network and as of this writing -- in 2008 -- The Miles Davis Story (2002) stands as the most honest biopic assessment of his life and career that has ever been assembled. Even as the primary focus remains on the music, none of Davis' skeletons are off limits, with plenty of first-hand accounts of him at his best and worst. Few stones are left unturned, from his unsettling relationships to the chronic bouts of substance abuse that fuelled his more disturbing personal incidents. Dibb's narration is sparse as the saga unfolds in the interviews. While all of the performance footage has circulated for decades among Davis devotees, it is actually the engaging and revealing comments -- courtesy of those he shared his life with on and off the bandstand -- that provide insights into the man behind the horn.</p><p>Among the key contributors are Clark Terry -- Davis' mentor from his early days in East St. Louis, IL -- as well as Jimmy Cobb, who was the last surviving member of the Kind of Blue (1959) musical dream team. Herbie Hancock (keyboards), Ron Carter (bass), Dave Holland (bass), Jack DeJohnette (drums), Joe Zawinul (keyboards), Keith Jarrett (keyboards), Chick Corea (keyboards), Mahavishnu John McLaughlin (guitar), David Liebman (sax), and Marcus Miller (bass) also provide their respective perspectives. As do two of the most important men behind the scenes: Bob Weinstock, the owner of the Riverside Jazz label, and Columbia Records' George Avakian. Both gentlemen deserve a tremendous amount of credit in their foresight when signing Davis, whose reputation as an irascible force of nature made him undesirable yet magnetic. As mentioned above there are plenty of concert excerpts of the artist. Yet one major oversight is the lack of any full-length performances. Arguably, these might not be appropriate in the context of the main program. However, the lack of substantive extras on this title make the additions a no-brainer. That said, viewers can find a cursory text biography and an equally perfunctory illustrated discography that deals exclusively with Davis' Columbia Records library.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

It was also, other than Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert -- which actually took place in the same month that this set was issued, and was issued eight months later -- the only new Clapton material that anyone would see for over a year, as the guitarist struggled through personal turmoil that included heroin addiction. No one who wasn't personally close to him knew that at the time -- this and the Rainbow Concert album were issued to keep his name before the public. And at the time, a lot of fans and critics were disappointed by this set -- the Layla album had already started to take on iconic status, with lots of listeners wearing out that album's grooves and reveling in its complexity, intensity, and seeming studio-generated perfection (plus the presence of Duane Allman).</p><p>Comprised of live performances, In Concert never seemed as compelling: for starters, Allman hadn't been present for either of the shows that was recorded (and, in fact, only appeared at a tiny handful of Dominos performances), which made this a somewhat different band. And what we did get was a much more relaxed and often more soulful, involving body of music, starting with the opening track, \"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad\" and continuing with \"Got to Get Better in a Little While\"; there was also some disappointment in the sound quality, however, and with the song selection. Despite the fact that they were touring to support the album that carried its name, the group seldom ever performed their most recognizable song, \"Layla\"; and their repertory was filled out with material from past Clapton projects rather than more material off the Layla album; in effect, the Dominos had become the first Eric Clapton Band, which made this a little less than a live account of this band's work. Thus, it was the hardcore fans who fully embraced this record, mostly for its transcendent moments and the beautiful interplay of the musicians, especially on their own repertory.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Live at the Fillmore is not exactly an expanded version of In Concert; it is a different album culled from the same concerts that were used to compile the earlier album. Live at the Fillmore contains six of the nine recordings originally released on In Concert, and three of its five previously unreleased performances are different recordings of songs also featured on In Concert -- \"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?,\" \"Tell the Truth,\" and \"Let It Rain.\" The other two, \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\" and \"Little Wing,\" have not been heard before in any concert version. Even when the same recordings are used on Live at the Fillmore as on In Concert, they have, as noted, been remixed and, as not noted, re-edited. In either form, Derek and the Dominos' October 1970 stand at the Fillmore East, a part of the group's only U.S. tour, finds them a looser aggregation than they seemed to be in the studio making their only album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. A trio backing Eric Clapton, the Dominos leave the guitarist considerable room to solo on extended numbers, five of which run over ten minutes each. Clapton doesn't show consistent invention, but his playing is always directed, and he plays more blues than you can hear on any other Clapton live recording.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This is, perhaps, the one. Derek Trucks has been on an aesthetic quest for something since he began his own recording career in 1997 — apart from his membership in the Allman Brothers Band. Each record has gone further into establishing Trucks not only as a slide guitar wizard (that happened when he was still in his teens), but also as a serious songwriter, fine arranger, and bandleader. The Derek Trucks Band, as evidenced by the release of 2003's Soul Serenade, is a unit — a band — whose core has been together for eight years. They create an atmosphere, a sound, a musical sense of place and community. On Live at the Georgia Theater (available only on the Internet), the DTB performed with new vocalist Mike Mattison, who gave them something they needed: a strong, utilitarian presence that could be as diverse and adventurous as the band was musically. This album's title, Songlines, was inspired by the late author Bruce Chatwin's description of aboriginal creation myths. According to these myths, the world was sung into existence by totemic elder beings who wandered the Australian continent along invisible pathways. These were later known as \"songlines\" because by singing out the names of everything — trees, flowers, streams, animals, clouds, earth — they breathed form, order, and beauty into a world that was being born. The DTB try to express something similar on their first real studio recording with assistance by producer Jay Joyce. This album was not recorded trying to capture a live performance in the confines of a studio. There are no tracks here that give way to loose jamming; these are songs. In fact, it was carefully crafted and executed. But the rawness, the energy, and the unpredictable musicality are everywhere present.</p><p>They are there in the brief read of Rahsaan Roland Kirk's \"Volunteered Slavery\" and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's \"Sahib Teri Bandi/Maki Madni,\" both of which are live staples, and the slippery read of Toots Hibbert's \"Sailing On\" — but also in the raw, rangy American street blues of \"Chevrolet,\" by Lonnie and Ed Young, and the low-down seductive vintage funky R&B in \"All I Do.\" Kofi Burbridge's Hammond B-3 and keyboard work create a center for Trucks and the formidable rhythm section of drummer Yonrico Scott, percussionist Count Mbutu, and Todd Smallie on in-the-pocket bass. The originals on the set are leaner, meaner, and more down in the groove — check out the group vocal chants on the refrain of \"Revolution,\" as Trucks slips and slides over them. The skittering funky organ lines and Trucks' twinned slide riff and edgy fills give \"All I Do\" its slippery backbone-dropping groove. \"Majoun\" (a Moroccan word for pot) is the kind of drifting, Eastern-tinged jazz that the band is known for playing live. And the fascination with the East doesn't end there. In the soul and gospel-drenched declamatory prayer \"I Wish I Knew (How It Would Feel to Be Free),\" there is some fine Dobro work by Trucks and Burbridge's upright piano strides it out, before Trucks brings out the electric again and lets it slowly tear through the verse and chorus accompanied by handclaps. It's deeply moving. The set closes with \"This Sky,\" a gently evolving open modal tune. Trucks' guitar is tuned to whole tones and he explores the mode thoroughly yet softly, mannered until he finds its bottom where bass, drums, the B-3, and percussion slip in to carry the tune. And as Mattison enters with the lyric (some of it by the Sufi poet Hafiz), the listener is already hooked in the image of the story, of suffering lovers who should be dancing in the ecstasy and beauty of the sky where they live. Songlines is the finest moment in the Derek Trucks Band's recording career. It's a fully mature, deeply reckoned studio album that bears repeated listening to reveal all its subtlety and the beauty of its creation.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

With Jan Hammer or Barry Miles on keyboards, electric bassist Anthony Jackson, drummer Lenny White (Steve Gadd takes his place on the \"Elegant Gypsy Suite\"), and percussionist Mingo Lewis on most of the selections, di Meola shows off his speedy and rock-ish fusion style. He was still a member of Return to Forever at the time and was a stronger guitarist than composer, but di Meola did put a lot of thought into this music. The brief \"Lady of Rome, Sister of Brazil\" (an acoustic guitar solo) and \"Mediterranean Sundance\" (an acoustic duet with fellow guitarist Paco de Lucía) hints at di Meola's future directions. A near classic in the fusion vein.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Scott Yanow</strong></p>"

The longer compositions drone on without establishing anything substantial, while the short pieces fade in and out, offering bits and pieces of fine playing, but nothing thematically distinguished.

A welcome addition to his already impressive catalogue, DiMeola Plays Piazzola pays homage to the late Argentinean tango master Astor Piazzolla (whose distinctive and very poetic brand of romanticism was considered quite daring and radical in Argentina). It would have been easy for an artist to allow his own personality to become obscured when saluting Piazzola's legacy, but the charismatic DiMeola is too great an improvisor to let that happen. Though his reverence for Piazzola comes through loud and clear on these haunting classics, there's no mistaking the fact that this is very much an Al DiMeola project.</p>&mdash; <b>Alex Henderson</b>"

The great guitarist is joined by two members of his World Sinfonia acoustic group -- Gumbi Ortiz on percussion and Mario Parmisano on keyboards -- in addition to such stellar musicians as Gonzalo Rubalcaba, flutist Alejandro Santos, and bassist Anthony Jackson, who recorded with DiMeola on his best-selling Elegant Gypsy album in the mid-'80s. Offering classic guitar lines on an array of guitars (including a vintage Les Paul, Fender Stratocaster, and Conde-Romano acoustic), Al DiMeola is memorable, timeless, and true to the beauty, culture and sensual imagery that inspired him to compose and arrange these eight great songs. Each song is a masterpiece, and such compositions as \"Flesh on Flesh\" (which features him on five different instruments), \"Zona Desperata,\" and \"Fugata\" (which showcases DiMeola trading with Gonzalo Rubalcaba on their Fender Rhodes solo in part three) are just three of the musical statements befitting all who've been lucky enough to see or hear DiMeola's phenomenal sound \"live.\" To hear that same energy and excitement recorded \"live\" on Flesh on Flesh is especially gratifying since the music is developed and takes place in a new context, space, and time. You'll find that every graceful musical curve, every dynamic concept, every technological update heard on Flesh on Flesh is a celebration of new forms and functions, of strict rhythmic reinterpretation and the inimitable DiMeola sound and guitar virtuosity.

		"review": "<p>The sticker on the disc's cover states that this is \"a return to his solid-body electric guitar,\" and while that may be true in parts, Consequence of Chaos is still pretty far from the tense, nonstop electric sizzle of di Meola's first three albums, which are landmarks in the jazz fusion genre. And while there is plenty of electric guitar here — and a musical reconnection with Chick Corea, Steve Gadd, and Barry Miles, all of whom have previously worked with di Meola — this is still dominated by the world music and more subtle framework that have characterized the guitarist's playing for the last few decades. The performances are uniformly excellent, and even though the approach shifts from prog to acoustic to electric and world, di Meola's distinctive style and classy approach congeal the music with authority. \"Tao\" alone takes more turns than a craggy mountain road, but never gets predictable or pretentious. Di Meola knows when to hold back and when to unleash his precise, percussive, fret-shredding Latin lines, and it's that sense of restraint that makes this disc, and much of his recent work, so successful. These instrumental pieces lay down a groove upon which di Meola solos with different combinations of musicians. Melodies are difficult to pinpoint, but the sublime playing keeps the listener's interest despite a tendency to wander. Four brief, low-key interludes feature an unaccompanied di Meola playing all the instruments, and provide a more relaxed counterpoint to the busier band tracks. Percussionists Ernie Adams and Gumbi Ortiz's standout work, especially on the subtle \"Hypnose,\" add hot, bubbling flavor to the project. Chick Corea only appears on two tracks, but both are highlights. The lovely acoustic duet on \"Cry for You\" brings out the best in both musicians as their interplay reaches new heights. Di Meola calls the nine-minute \"Tempest\" his most complex piece — which is saying a lot — as it twists through different moods and tones utilizing varying rhythms in an impressive display of the guitarist's dazzling skills. It's a summation of this album that shows di Meola, after 30 years as a solo artist, to be on the top of his game.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Hal Horowitz</b></p>"

Though he was often derided at the time as a pale imitation of Bob Dylan, there isn't a lot of evidence here; true, he does cover the Woody Guthrie song \"Car Car (Riding in My Car)\" and gives it some twang worthy of the master, but his style is his own, slanted toward the mysticism of British folk less than the earthiness of its American cousin. Donovan summons the proper age-old weariness for \"Goldwatch Blues,\" gets a bit bluesy for \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond,\" and lets it all hang out for \"Keep on Truckin'.\" [A 2002 reissue by Castle added four bonus tracks, including versions of \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Colours,\" plus the B-sides \"Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do\" and \"Every Man Has His Chain.\"]</p><p>&mdash; <b>John Bush</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>So I'm playing with my new office chair right now.  The floor of my     apartment is wood-finished and extremely warped, so there are all     kinds of little bumps and valleys to roll over.  Combine that with     the fact that all the ball bearings and wheels are brand new and     heavily viscous and I could amuse myself doing this for quite a     while.  I guess it's the simple things that give you pleasure after a     long day at work, juggling projects and trying to get out of there at     five.  My job is pretty hectic and I usually come home all wound up,     so it's good to have these little diversions to help myself.  Tonight     the stress has me feeling particularly goofy.          Normally I wouldn't think of Manchester's Doves as an appropriate     soundtrack for this kind of mood, but that's largely because until     very recently I was only familiar with their first album, 2000's     dark, murky Lost Souls.  On that record, the band showed     their facility with dark, claustrophobic textures and muted melodic     statements, only occasionally indulging their impressive pop sense.     And while their latest offering, The Last Broadcast, could     hardly be called a wholesale revamping of their sound, it concentrates     mostly on elements that the trio kept very subdued on their debut.          For one thing, while Lost Souls was certainly nothing to sniff     at, the band sounds infinitely more comfortable and confident here,     placing more faith in their writing and relying less on production to     put forth their ideas.  The record still abounds with thoughtful     audio details, mind you-- but here they're almost always employed in     the service of melody.  Even the exceptions to that rule-- the short     instrumental tracks like \"Intro\" and \"Where We're Calling From\"--     build tension while moving toward the catharsis of the next     fully-fleshed song.          \"Where We're Calling From\" is a dense wall of swirling guitars and     keyboards, growing ever thicker until finally evaporating, leaving     the initial strums of \"N.Y.\" in its place.  \"N.Y.\" is exultant in     its first verse, all crashing guitars and soaring vocals. The     instrumental midsection is one the band's finest moments, cut     through with an unobtrusive string section and some surprisingly     dynamic interplay.  \"Let's go while we can/ Put your finger on the     map/ Who cares where it lands,\" sings Jez Williams as the song gathers     steam behind him.  It's one of several tracks that makes The Last     Broadcast a brighter, and in some ways more accessible, album     than its predecessor.          Elsewhere, the band lay down a ream of excellent songs beginning     with \"Words,\" a steadily chugging confection of astral guitar, vocal     harmonies and glockenspiel that does a remarkable job of boring a     limited melody straight into your memory.  It's followed by the     loping, seven-minute \"There Goes the Fear,\" which is a strong candidate     for one of the band's best songs yet, its bounce befitting the subdued     melody and diving, almost country-ish slide guitar that swoops in the     background.  Doves have always been a band who could come out swinging     with a powerful pop song when they wanted to, and this just proves that     they should do it more often.          A few songs naturally point back to the band's original direction,     such as the haunting, noir \"Friday's Dust,\" with its crystalline     strings (arranged by Sean O'Hagan and Marcus Holdaway) and strange     production.  Devoid of percussion, the song floats along almost like     something Talk Talk might have produced in their later years, replete     with ghostly clarinets and odd smatterings of brass.  Of course,     \"Pounding\" bounces right back with a... well, pounding rhythm and a     sterling melody, as well as some spirited rhythm guitar.          The boys get downright proggy on the intro to \"The Sulphur Man,\" with     sweeping strings deceptively setting the stage for what turns out to     be a relatively modest song, albeit one cut through with all sorts of     inventive little flourishes, like the strings that rise in the     verses, threatening to overtake the vocals before abruptly backing     down and retreating to the background, only to attempt another coup     a few seconds later.  It's those details that make a good song great,     and that's what makes The Last Broadcast an easy record to     come back to-- chances are you missed an awful lot the first few     times you listened.          \"Caught by the River\" closes things on a high note, riding out on a     sturdy acoustic guitar frame adorned by the band's usual sonic     fireworks and pushed forward by some very economical drumming.     To the listener's benefit, the electric guitar parts aren't so     economical, and the band masterfully layers soaring leads, ultimately     ending on a glowing bed of reverb and clean guitar.  It's a fittingly     dramatic end to an album that's full of drama, without the tiresome     excess-- a healthy balance if you ask me.  Watch your toes while I     chair-speed back to the stereo to give it another spin.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Joe Tangari, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>It's little wonder why Drake felt frustrated at the lack of commercial success his music initially gathered, considering the help he had on his debut record. Besides fine production from Joe Boyd and assistance from folks like Fairport Convention's Richard Thompson and his unrelated bass counterpart from Pentangle, Danny Thompson, Drake also recruited school friend Robert Kirby to create most of the just-right string and wind arrangements. His own performance itself steered a careful balance between too-easy accessibility and maudlin self-reflection, combining the best of both worlds while avoiding the pitfalls on either side. The result was a fantastic debut appearance, and if the cult of Drake consistently reads more into his work than is perhaps deserved, Five Leaves Left is still a most successful effort. Having grown out of the amiable but derivative styles captured on the long-circulating series of bootleg home recordings, Drake assays his tunes with just enough drama -- world-weariness in the vocals, carefully paced playing, and more -- to make it all work. His lyrics capture a subtle poetry of emotion, as on the pastoral semi-fantasia of \"The Thoughts of Mary Jane,\" which his soft, articulate singing brings even more to the full. Sometimes he projects a little more clearly, as on the astonishing voice-and-strings combination \"Way to Blue,\" while elsewhere he's not so clear, suggesting rather than outlining the mood. Understatement is the key to his songs and performances' general success, which makes the combination of his vocals and Rocky Dzidzornu's congas on \"Three Hours\" and the lovely \"'Cello Song,\" to name two instances, so effective. Danny Thompson is the most regular side performer on the album, his bass work providing subtle heft while never standing in the way of the song -- kudos well deserved for Boyd's production as well.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ned Raggett</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Dream Theater's Greatest Hit (....And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs) collection is a strange animal indeed. Despite the band's amazingly longevity -- they cut their first demo in 1986 -- as a touring act and as a steadily selling concern in the product marketplace, they've had exactly one hit, sort of, in 1992's \"Pull Me Under\" from the album Images and Words. That they are still together and still a viable touring and recording enterprise is testament enough in these strange times. Apparently, though, that's not enough for them. Drummer Mike Portnoy and his bandmembers assembled this collection with a few twists that make for rather curious listening. Divided into two discs collecting 22 cuts, the first oddity is that the epic, intricate pro-pop metallic jams they are most closely associated with are almost entirely absent here. In their place, as Portnoy goes to great lengths to explain in his liner notes (which amount to more of an apologia than anything else), are a \"dark side\" disc reflecting the more riff-centric, metallic, guitar and double bass drum tunes that have been influenced by everyone from Black Sabbath and Judas Priest to Iron Maiden and Metallica. The other disc, is, predictably enough, the \"light side.\" Here, the tunes reflect the more melodic, accessibly progressive aspect of the band that has been influenced by, \"...U2, Pink Floyd, Journey, and Peter Gabriel.\" Whatever. What's worse, Portnoy somehow thinks that this set is for the uninitiated, and claims he sees it almost as a \"TV commercial or a coming attraction for a film...something that will lure the viewers/listeners in and inspire them to dig deeper, eventually leading them to experience the 'full picture'...\" Apparently, he hasn't been paying attention to what's been going on in a marketplace increasingly reliant on digital media.</p><p>As for the music itself, here's the rub: the only real thing to attract veteran fans are some 2007 remixes including \"Pull Me Under\" (they messed with their sole pop culture classic!!!!), \"Take the Time,\" and \"Another Day,\" and edits that include shortened versions of \"Lie,\" \"Home,\" \"Misunderstood,\" and \"Solitary Shell.\" There is also an alternate album mix of the track \"Through Her Eyes.\" The cover sticker reflects this, but the actual track listing on the back of the package does not. Musically, if you are a Dream Theater fan and need to have everything, you already know these tracks, and have them in at least two versions -- live and studio -- anyway, and the remixes are nothing whatsoever to write home about. If you are a novice, you'd be better of picking up one of the band's truly classic recordings such as Images and Words, Change of Seasons, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, or Scenes from a Memory to hear their studio magic, on the one hand, or, Live Scenes from New York on the other. This double-disc makes little sense. Excess is one of the greatest things about Dream Theater: they are one of the best live bands on the planet and understand that big rock & roll is about the show as well as great musicianship, but sometimes, even grand excess is a little to o grand for its own good; this is just such a case.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

The difference was that not very many people heard Bob Dylan on its original release (originals on the early-'60s Columbia label are choice collectibles) because it was recorded with a much smaller audience and musical arena in mind. At the time of Bob Dylan's release, the folk revival was rolling, and interpretation was considered more important than original composition by most of that audience. A significant portion of the record is possessed by the style and spirit of Woody Guthrie, whose influence as a singer and guitarist hovers over \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" and \"Pretty Peggy-O,\" as well as the two originals here, the savagely witty \"Talkin' New York\" and the poignant \"Song to Woody\"; and it's also hard to believe that he wasn't aware of Jimmie Rodgers and Roy Acuff when he cut \"Freight Train Blues.\" But on other songs, one can also hear the influences of Bukka White, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Blind Willie Johnson, and Furry Lewis, in the playing and singing, and this is where Dylan departed significantly from most of his contemporaries. Other white folksingers of the era, including his older contemporaries Eric Von Schmidt and Dave Van Ronk, had incorporated blues in their work, but Dylan's presentation was more in your face, resembling in some respects (albeit in a more self-conscious way) the work of John Hammond, Jr., the son of the man who signed Dylan to Columbia Records and produced this album, who was just starting out in his own career at the time this record was made. There's a punk-like aggressiveness to the singing and playing here. His raspy-voiced delivery and guitar style were modeled largely on Guthrie's classic '40s and early-'50s recordings, but the assertiveness of the bluesmen he admires also comes out, making this one of the most powerful records to come out of the folk revival of which it was a part. Within a year of its release, Dylan, initially in tandem with young folk/protest singers like Peter, Paul & Mary and Phil Ochs, would alter the boundaries of that revival beyond recognition, but this album marked the pinnacle of that earlier phase, before it was overshadowed by this artist's more ambitious subsequent work. In that regard, the two original songs here serve as the bridge between Dylan's stylistic roots, as delineated on this album, and the more powerful and daringly original work that followed. One myth surrounding this album should also be dispelled here -- his version of \"House of the Rising Sun\" here is worthwhile, but the version that was the inspiration for the Animals' recording was the one by Josh White.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Taking a break from sessions for his breakthrough sophomore LP, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, the landmark \"Gaslight Tapes\" capture Dylan's evolution from prodigy to poet, transforming the raw materials of idols like Blind Lemon Jefferson and Leadbelly to create his own postmodern folklore for the New Frontier. Galvanized by the earliest recorded live performances of the soon-to-be-classics \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\" both the originals and the covers resonate with searing vitality and authority, serving notice that their creator has finally begun living the life his art's always evoked. Rattlesnake's Gaslight Tapes 1962 is an excellent presentation of this much-bootlegged material, boasting superior sound and packaging distinguished by lovely hand-colored photos. The Starbucks coffee chain gave this music belated official release in mid-2005 with its exclusive Live at the Gaslight 1962, but for unknown reasons the disc contains only ten of the 17 tracks that comprise the performance in its entirety. For now, serious Dylan enthusiasts still must seek out underground editions to hear the tapes in their entirety.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jason Ankeny</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The mysterious tape of early Bob Dylan performances said to have been recorded at the Gaslight Café in Greenwich Village in 1962 began turning up on bootleg albums such as Ode for Barbara Allen, The Gaslight Tapes, Dylan '62, and Barbed Wire Blues in the 1970s. In 1991, one track, \"No More Auction Block,\" earned legitimate release on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased), but this ten-track disc is the first extensive issuance of the material in legal form. The mystery of the origins of the recordings remains, however. Dylan scholars tend to date them from the fall of 1962, but there is no assurance they were actually made at the Gaslight, and tapes circulating among collectors contain more songs than the 11 now commercially available. (Among the missing songs is an early version of \"Ballad of Hollis Brown,\" later heard on 1964's The Times They Are a-Changin'.) Nevertheless, this album is a valuable missing link between Dylan's self-titled debut album (released in March 1962), which consisted mostly of cover tunes, and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (released in May 1963), which unveiled Dylan the songwriter. Most of the songs Dylan performs here are covers, but there are early versions of \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,\" two of the major songs that would appear on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, as well as \"Rocks and Gravel\" (a free-form adaptation of Brownie McGhee's \"Solid Road\" and Leroy Carr's \"Alabama Woman Blues\"), which was recorded for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and even included on its initial version, and the antiwar \"John Brown,\" later recorded for the various-artists album Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1. Those songs reveal Dylan's emerging songwriting talent (the lyrics of \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" don't even seem quite finished), while the other six songs are more reminiscent of the gruff traditional folksinger of the Bob Dylan album, though one who can be gentler (\"Barbara Allen\") and more provocative (\"Cocaine\") than he seemed on his first LP. The recordings are considerably clearer than the bootleg versions, but they retain their unofficial quality, with occasional flaws, the most notable of which is the abrupt ending of the final track, \"West Texas.\" [Live at the Gaslight 1962 was made available initially only at Starbucks coffee shops and at the Starbucks-owned Web site]</p>&mdash; <b>William Ruhlmann</b>"

Some showed up on The Bootleg Series and Biograph, but others have stayed in the vault. This is a superb 25-song compilation of the best unreleased material from the 1962 studio sessions, including interesting originals like \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown,\" \"The Death of Emmett Till,\" and \"Let Me Die in My Footsteps\"; a bunch of solid folk and blues covers like \"Baby Please Don't Go\" and \"Milk Cow Blues\"; and alternates of a few tracks that were released, notably \"Corrina, Corrina\" and \"Mixed Up Confusion.\" Most fascinating of all are several tracks featuring electric band accompaniment, including the aforementioned \"Corrina, Corrina\" and \"Mixed Up Confusion,\" but also \"That's All Right,\" the Arthur Crudup blues covered on Elvis Presley's first single. The sound is excellent, and while the official Freewheelin' had much stronger and more innovative original material, the performances on this collection (featuring multiple versions of some songs) are extremely strong and assured. This is absolutely essential for Dylan fans, and one of the relatively few bootlegs that can be unequivocally recommended to general music consumers, not just specialist collectors. There's even an outtake from the Freewheelin' photo session on the cover.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

Although Grogan died in 1978, the tapes in question did not resurface until early 1995, at which point they were the subject of furious pirating among Dylan bootleggers; the two-disc As Good as It Gets remains the definitive compilation of this material in terms of both sound and packaging, adding demos from the legendary Highway 61 Revisited sessions to paint an authoritative portrait of Dylan's evolution from folk to rock &amp; roll.

Publishers are standard practice for songwriters &mdash; it's where the money comes in, as songs are published, performed, and covered &mdash; but in the early '60s there was an expectation that publishers would help place songs in the hands of appropriate singers, a practice Dylan effectively ended by popularizing writers singing their own songs, but in 1962, this self-sufficiency was a rarity. Even his 1962 debut contained only three Dylan originals, which in his case reflected his traditional folk roots, but Dylan needed a publisher for those three songs so John Hammond, who signed the singer/songwriter to Columbia, pointed him toward Leeds Music. Dylan cut a demo session for Leeds between the recording and release of Bob Dylan and when that album wound up stiffing, Leeds let him buy out his contract in the summer of 1962, which then led to him signing with M. Witmark &amp; Sons publishing company. Between 1962 and 1964, a period that roughly spanned \"Blowin' in the Wind\" to \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" Dylan cut several demo sessions for Witmark, usually with the intent of the publisher pitching songs to other singers. Many of his early classics were first essayed here &mdash; \"A Hard-Rain's Gonna Fall,\" \"Masters of War,\" \"Don't Think Twice It's Alright,\" \"Boots of Spanish Leather,\" \"Girl from the North Country,\" \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\" &mdash; and he also cut songs he never revisited. Some wound up with other artists &mdash; \"Seven Curses,\" \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time,\" \"Mama, You Been on My Mind\" &mdash; some were lost to time, leaking out on bootlegs until they officially surfaced on 2010's The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964.</p><p>Many of these recordings have been heavily bootlegged, some excerpted on previous Bootleg Series, but they've never been presented as completely and in as great fidelity as they are on this two-disc set. Great fidelity seems almost unnecessary for such simple recordings, although the cleanliness enhances the intimacy, so familiar songs are lent freshness when surrounded by the thumping of a microphone or closing of a door. This disarming intimacy &mdash; verging on eavesdropping &mdash; is as attractive as the 15 songs that never appeared on an official Dylan album. Some of these songs are throwaways &mdash; \"Bound to Lose, Bound to Win\" lacks finished verses, with Bob promising that he'll write them down later &mdash; but there's considerable charm in hearing Dylan tossing off a song, plus some of these half-forgotten discards, like \"Guess I'm Doing Fine\" and \"All Over You,\" are still quite strong. Nevertheless, the real appeal of this volume of the Bootleg Series is to listen as Dylan develops as a songwriter and artist. The songs spilled forth at an astonishing rate, and the great majority were not only superb, they were different from what came before, with his Woody Guthrie homage quickly replaced by a quick-witted protest singer who then started to delve into the personal in revolutionary ways. At its core, these demos are the sound of Dylan becoming Bob Dylan, and it's an evolution that's spellbinding.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>In his 2004 memoir, Chronicles, Volume One, Bob Dylan writes of encountering Mike Seeger in the early 1960s in Greenwich Village, and being left spellbound by the effortless mastery the folk legend exhibited in his interpretations of a dizzying array of traditional American song forms. \"He played these songs as good as it was possible to play them,\" Dylan writes, adding that, \"What I had to work at, Mike already had in his genes, in his genetic makeup... The thought occurred to me that maybe I'd have to write my own folk songs.\"</p><p>The 47 songs collected on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964 allow us to witness how Dylan went about doing just that. Representing the fruits of his first two publishing contracts (with Leeds Music and with M. Witmark &amp; Sons), the set reveals a much subtler and more fascinating journey than the popular shorthand myth of Dylan's shifting cleanly from folk apprentice to political firebrand to poetic rock'n'roller. For starters, a great many of the songs to which Dylan first affixed his name as writer were simply his own original lyrics atop traditional folk melodies. Not all of these words excoriated social injustice either&mdash; far from it. Even from the beginning, there were love songs and outlaw songs, moodily poetic songs and broad jokes. Still, The Witmark Demos does demonstrate an evolution in songwriting genius, and one that took place in a frighteningly short period of a time by a young man who'd yet to turn 24 when the last of these recordings were made. On this set, you can hear Dylan moving past the bedrock melodies of folk and crafting indelible ones of his own (\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\"). You can hear him perfecting the protest song (\"Blowin' in the Wind\", \"Masters of War\"). And you can hear him falling in love with the music of words and beginning to invent a new vocabulary for pop music (a scratchy, nascent piano-only take of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\").</p><p>Only 15 of the set's 47 songs are unheard in any incarnation on a previous Dylan release (more on them later). The other 32 are split fairly evenly between germinal takes on songs from early-60s Dylan albums and alternate rough cuts of tunes that appear in equally embryonic states on the first Bootleg Series issue, 1991's Volumes 1-3. You might think auxiliary efforts would be of interest only to Dylan obsessives&mdash; and in some cases these readings scarcely differ from others in his catalogue. Still, there are revelations: The oft-covered \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\" has appeared previously only in live form on Dylan's second greatest hits compilation, and the version here is far richer, the guitar playing lovely and sublime. The classic protest song \"Oxford Town\" may be less immaculate here, but it's more bracing and insistent. The readings of \"Mama, You've Been on My Mind\" and \"I'll Keep It with Mine\" are especially pained and plaintive, while the bitingly satirical \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" and \"Rambling, Gambling Willie\" are looser and more ebullient here than anywhere else they've appeared before.</p><p>As for the 15 \"new\" songs, a few are mere fragments and a few others are fairly boilerplate, but again there are real treasures. \"Farewell\" haunts with its melody while \"The Death of Emmett Till\" haunts with its words, yet both are outshone by the bitterly ironic tour de force \"Long Ago, Far Away\", where Dylan enumerates social injustices ostensibly relegated to the distant past that were in fact still occuring in his own time, witheringly spitting the refrain, \"Those things don't happen no more nowadays.\" \"I'd Hate to Be You on That Dreadful Day\" and \"All Over You\" further display comic sides, and then there's \"Long Time Gone\", which shows us an initial flowering of the unflappably cool mythical icon Dylan would fully become in the mid-60s. The song's refrain offers a perfect summation of how this set reveals the historical depth of Dylan's musical education as well as the lengths to which he would eclipse it. \"I'm a long time a-comin',\" Dylan sings, \"and I'll be a long time gone.\"</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Joshua Love, Pitchfork</strong></p><hr/><h4>In Concert At Brandeis University</h4><p>Originally released on Amazon as a bonus disc for early purchasers of 2010's The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9 and The Original Mono Recordings, Bob Dylan in Concert: Brandeis University 1963 saw a wide release in the spring of 2011. Unlike the archival concerts that have popped up in The Bootleg Series, Brandeis University 1963 isn't a major statement. At seven songs, it's brief and there's no mythology behind the show; a recording wasn't even known to exist until a tape was found within the collection of music critic Ralph J. Gleason in 2009. It may be minor, but as a live recording of Dylan between the release of his debut and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, it is certainly noteworthy, a glimpse of Dylan working folk festival bills unencumbered by fame or legend. He chooses topical songs for his two sets, bypassing \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind\" in favor of \"Masters of War,\" \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues,\" \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown,\" \"Talkin' World War III Blues,\" and \"Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,\" material that accentuates the show's roots in May of 1963. Dylan is in good form, open and sometimes skirting on the edge of being lively, never quite revealing that it was slightly risky to entertain a festival audience with a collection of originals previously unheard by the crowd. If the show doesn't quite manage to be memorable, it is certainly engaging, a worthwhile 38 minutes even if it doesn't quite have much more than a historic hook to warrant repeated plays.</p><p><strong>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>This short live album was originally released in 2010 as a bonus disc to The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964, which collected rough recordings that Bob Dylan made as part of his first two publishing deals. They were impromptu sessions in a glorified broom closet, but produced the first known recordings of some of his signature tunes, including \"Don't Think Twice It's Alright\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind\". At nearly 50 tracks, the hefty set provides a good context for In Concert: Brandeis University 1963, which was recorded during the same period. By showing his songs in their earliest, roughest, unfinished forms, Witmark allows us some insight into Dylan's creative process, while Brandeis offers a glimpse at his performative process. Together, the two sets trace a careful trajectory from song kernel to setlist, from private development to public presentation, which makes them an intriguing and useful primary source that reveals new facets of this thoroughly studied artist.</p><p>The Brandeis show was recorded in May 1963, which is auspicious: Just two weeks later, Dylan would release his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, which would make him folk's first rock star, rocketing him out of college gymnasiums and into concert halls. At this point, he was still in his very early twenties and had released only one previous record, a self-titled LP that was a notoriously poor seller. At the Brandeis Folk Festival, he was billed under Pete Seeger and Jean Ritchie, among several other, more established acts.</p><p>As scholar Michael Gray writes in the new liner notes (which weren't included in the bonus version), this was a fairly typical Dylan show for the time. It's likely he gave many similar performances in 1962 and early 1963, and all that distinguishes this one from any other is that it survives. Only recently discovered in the archives of the late critic Ralph J. Gleason, co-founder of Rolling Stone, the tapes provide a valuable snapshot of pre-fame Dylan, who gives a rambling performance that balances gravity with levity. \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" and \"Talkin' World War III Blues\" scoff at anti-communist scaremongering and war-profiteering justifications, and Dylan's barbed satire provokes some laughs from his audience. He addresses the same subjects on the dead-serious \"Masters of War\" and \"Bob Dylan's Dream\", on which his earnest strumming and mournful harmonica evoke a sense of solitude, as if sanity in the face of such madness has isolated him from humanity.</p><p>The setlist is, however, lackluster, showcasing what would become deep-album cuts to the neglect of his better material. By the time he winds up his lengthy intro to \"Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\", his talking blues delivery has grown tiresome even. Of course, Dylan was likely tailoring his setlist to his audience and perhaps to the festival itself. Regardless, at seven songs (six-and-a-half if you discount the excerpt of \"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\"), Brandeis is necessarily slight. It needs context. In that regard, it might have been interesting to hear this set as one of the many live performances from that same folk festival, if only for the opportunity to contrast Dylan with his contemporaries and to determine his place within the folk scene. Otherwise, it's difficult&mdash; if not impossible&mdash; to determine from these recordings what exactly distinguished this ambitious young artist from everyone else with a guitar and harmonica. Ultimately, Brandeis was more valuable and revealing as a bonus disc than as a standalone album.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

It isn't as rich as Freewheelin', and Dylan has tempered his sense of humor considerably, choosing to concentrate on social protests in the style of \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" With the title track, he wrote an anthem that nearly equaled that song, and \"With God on Our Side\" and \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\" are nearly as good, while \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\" and \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\" are remarkably skilled re-castings of contemporary tales of injustice. His absurdity is missed, but he makes up for it with the wonderful \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Boots of Spanish Leather,\" two lovely classics. If there are a couple of songs that don't achieve the level of the aforementioned songs, that speaks more to the quality of those songs than the weakness of the remainder of the record. And that's also true of the album itself -- yes, it pales next to its predecessor, but it's terrific by any other standard.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

It's all about Dylan's 1965 British tour and the frantic scene that surrounded him. A minor flaw: it doesn't get any better than the opening conceptual video of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\"</p><p><b>&mdash; Bruce Eder</b></p><hr/><p>Director D.A. Pennebaker's black-and-white 1967 documentary film Don't Look Back largely chronicles Bob Dylan's tour of the U.K. in the spring of 1965, the last outing on which the not-quite-24-year-old singer/songwriter appeared solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. Already, however, he had begun to move toward folk-rock, having just recorded and released his LP Bringing It All Back Home, half of which consisted of arrangements featuring electric instruments. That he is in a transitional phase in his development comes out early, as the film opens with what is in effect an early music video, in which he stands in a an alley holding and discarding a pile of posters featuring words from his current folk-rock single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" as the record plays on the soundtrack. Then begins the film proper, as Pennebaker's hand-held camera follows him from his arrival in England on April 28, 1965, to his final concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on May 10. Right off the bat, the director's major theme, Dylan's relationship with the news media, emerges in a press conference at which mass-market journalists, skeptically treating him as a phenomenon, ask hostile questions couched in posh English accents. \"Do you think that a lot of the young people who buy your records understand a single word of what you're singing?,\" asks a woman, following up with, \"Would you say that you cared about people particularly?\" Dylan responds jokingly and good naturedly at first. But later in the film, as he reads or has read to him articles and reviews written about him and continues to encounter journalists backstage, he loses his patience and begins to give as well as he has gotten, and in considerably less calm tones, for example, telling off an unidentified reporter for Time magazine (Horace Judson) in no uncertain terms. It's not hard to hear the songwriter about to turn out \"Ballad of a Thin Man\" in his remarks. Something similar happens as Pennebaker chronicles the backstage and hotel room gatherings at which Dylan encounters fans and fellow musicians; again, things start out friendly enough, but there are also angry outbursts as too many people, some of them drunk, behave badly around the singer and get tongue lashings as a result. Again, the soon-to-be-written \"Positively 4th Street\" comes to mind. Dylan's main entourage consists of Bob Neuwirth, serving as personal assistant, and manager Albert Grossman, who does some shouting of his own and is glimpsed negotiating the terms of a television appearance (probably the one Dylan did for the BBC a few weeks later). Pennebaker also provides some footage of Dylan on-stage at various venues on the tour, although this is not primarily a performance film, and no song is performed in its entirety. Others also give impromptu performances backstage and in hotel rooms, including Alan Price, Joan Baez, and Donovan. When it first appeared in 1967, Don't Look Back was an eye-opening look at the tumultuous life of Bob Dylan circa 1965. It only grew in stature in later years, ranking as a classic examination of the world of popular music as it was lived in the ‘60s.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>\"Bob Dylan going electric\" at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival is one of those epochal moments in rock history that seemingly everyone has heard about, but what few people seem to know is that it wasn't some ephemeral event that we only know from word of mouth — filmmaker Murray Lerner documented the performances at the Newport Festival for several years running, and The Other Side of the Mirror collects footage from the three years Dylan appeared at the celebrated folk gathering, allowing us to see Dylan's rise through the folk scene for ourselves. Watching Lerner's documentary, what's most remarkable is how much Dylan changed over the course of 36 months; the young folkie performing at the afternoon \"workshop\" at the side of Joan Baez in 1963 is at once nervy and hesitant, singing his wordy tunes while chopping away at his acoustic guitar and energizing the crowd without seeming to know just what he's doing. In 1964, Dylan all but owns Newport, and he clearly knows it; he's the talk of the Festival, with Baez and Johnny Cash singing his praises (and his songs), and his command of the stage is visibly stronger and more confident while his new material (including \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"It Ain't Me, Babe\") sees him moving away from the \"protest songs\" that first made his name. When the audience demands an encore after Dylan's evening set (Odetta and Dave Van Ronk were scheduled to follow him), Peter Yarrow tries to keep the show moving along while Dylan beams at the crowd's adulation, like the rock star he was quickly becoming.</p><p>By the time the 1965 Newport Festival rolled around, Dylan's epochal \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was starting to scale the singles charts, and the hardcore folk audience was clearly of two minds about his popular (and populist) success. When Dylan, Fender Stratocaster in hand, performs \"Maggie's Farm\" backed by Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and the rhythm section from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the raucous but hard-driving number inspires a curious mixture of enthusiastic cheering and equally emphatic booing, and while legend has it that the version of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" that followed was a shambles, the song cooks despite drummer Sam Lay's difficulty in finding the groove, though if anything the division of the crowd's loyalties is even stronger afterward. After these two numbers, Dylan and his band leave the stage, with Yarrow (once again serving as MC) citing technical problems (if Pete Seeger really pulled the power on Dylan, as legend has it, there's no sign of it here); Dylan returns to the stage with an acoustic six-string to sing \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" before vanishing into the night without comment. While much of the audience at Newport in 1965 wanted the \"old\" Dylan back, his strong, willful performances even on the acoustic stuff makes it obvious that the scrappy semi-amateur we saw at the beginning of the movie was gone forever, and the ovations suggest more than a few people wanted to see Dylan rock. Lerner's film tells us a certain amount of what we already knows, but it gently debunks a few myths about Dylan during this pivotal moment in his career, and his performances are committed and forceful throughout; no matter how many times you've read about Dylan's Newport shoot-out of 1965, seeing it is a revelatory experience, and Lerner has assembled this archival material with intelligence and taste. This is must-see viewing for anyone interested in Dylan or the folk scene of the '60s.</p><strong>— Mark Deming</strong>"

		"review": "<p>Bob Dylan's transformation from folksinger to rock 'n' roll poet in the mid-sixties horrified many of his early fans. Traditionalists saw his use of loud amplified instruments as a corruption of folk music's purity. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan hit the road with an electric band, confronting his listeners face to face with his new rock oriented sound. Bootleg recordings of these incendiary performances have circulated among collectors for decades. Now the most famous of these bootlegs, known as the \"Royal Albert Hall\" show (even though it comes from the May 17, 1966 performance in Manchester, England and not the later show at the London venue) has finally been officially released. Live 1966: The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert documents one of the most fascinating and electrifying concert battles in music history.</p><p>On the first disc of the two CD set, Dylan plays solo, armed with only an acoustic guitar and harmonica. Perhaps because he still carries the tools of a folksinger, the audience responds to Dylan's seven song acoustic set with respectful silence and warm, enthusiastic applause. One listen to the lyrics, however, and it is clear that Dylan is well past the protest songs of his folk music roots. Like the work of the Beat poets, \"Visions of Johanna\" and \"Desolation Row\" pile one surrealistic image on top of another to present a world full of absurdity and madness. Dylan's performance too is otherworldly. His rough ghost of a voice sounds as if it is coming from out of a dream. But Dylan is obviously tuned into every word as he twists and turns the meaning of his prose by emphasizing different aspects of each syllable. The halting tenderness of \"Just Like a Woman\" is breathtaking and the harmonica solos in \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" are so hypnotic that Dylan seems to lose himself in their simple beauty as they spiral around his simple but effective guitar strumming. Asthe first half of the show ends, it appears that Dylan's masterful performance has captivated the skeptics in the audience.</p><p>The sound of electric guitars tuning up opens disc two and warns that the second set is an altogether different story. A distant voice and boot-stomp count in the beat before Dylan and his backing musicians called the Hawks, later named the Band, explode into the opening number, the previously unreleased \"Tell Me, Momma.\" The sound is loud and dense, with Robbie Robertson's splintering guitar riffs and Garth Hudson's hurdy-gurdy keyboards giving the roar a playfully ominous texture, as Dylan shouts like a madman and asks, \"Tell me, Momma. What's wrong with you? This tiiiime?\" The crowd hesitates a moment before applauding as if stunned by the assault. Dylan quickly plays a melody on his harmonica and introduces the next song, saying, \"That was \"I Don't Believe You.\" It used to go like that, now it goes like this.\" A searing rocked-up version of a tune from his folk days follows, coming across like a psychedelic, acid-dosed versionof Buddy Holly.</p><p>The battlelines are drawn. From now on, angry audience members greet each song with shouts and slow rhythmic handclapping to show their disapproval. Yet somehow, Dylan rises to the challenge and puts the protesters in their place every time. At one point, in order to quell the disruptive clapping, Dylan mumbles nonsense into the microphone until people quiet down in order to hear what he's saying. Once the noise subsides, he clearly implores, \". . . if you only wouldn't clap so hard.\" You gotta hand it to Bob. Who else carries out crowd control with such finesse and humor?</p><p>The music itself is also a response to the hostility in the air. \"Ballad of a Thin Man\" is more menacing than ever. In the charged atmosphere, its chorus, \"You know there's something happening he explains....</p><hr/><p>The most famous bootleg in rock history, with the possible exception of Dylan's own Basement Tapes, finally makes its official appearance 32 years after the event, and nearly 30 years after it started circulating in the underground. Although often identified as a Royal Albert Hall show, this May 17, 1966, concert, in which Dylan played electric material in front of a British audience, was actually recorded in Manchester (hence the unwieldy title with quotes around \"Royal Albert Hall\"). Even those who've owned this recording for many a year might be tempted by this official package, as it has been expanded into a two-CD set that not only includes the eight electric rock songs from the original bootleg, but also the seven solo acoustic performances that comprised the first half of the show. It's all in very good fidelity, about as good as any copies you could find through unofficial sources. More importantly, the electric half in particular is an important document of rock history. It captures the point at which Dylan was at his most controversial and hard rocking as he blazes through mid-'60s classics such as \"Like a Rolling Stone\" and \"Ballad of a Thin Man,\" radical electric arrangements of songs that had originally been recorded acoustically (\"One Too Many Mornings,\" \"I Don't Believe You\"), and the hard rocker \"Tell Me, Momma,\" which Dylan never recorded in the studio. The acoustic disc is not as epochal, but on par with the electric half in the quality of material and performance. On top of everything else there's a 56-page booklet with a fine essay by Dylan's friend Tony Glover (a notable folk musician in his own right). It's not just an interesting adjunct to Dylan's '60s discography; it's as worthy of attention as anything else he recorded during that decade.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>It's virtually impossible to approach No Direction Home without a cluster of fixed ideas. Who doesn't have their own private Dylan? The true excellence of Martin Scorsese's achievement lies in how his documentary shakes us free of our comfortable assumptions. In the process, it plays out on several levels at once, each taking shape as an unfailingly fascinating narrative. There is, of course, the central story of an individual genius staking out his artistic identity. But along with this Bildungsroman come other threads and contexts: most notably, the role of popular culture in postwar America, art's self-reliance versus its social responsibilities, and fans' complicity with the publicity machine in sustaining myths. All of these threads reinforce each other, together weaving the film's intricate texture.</p><p>Scorsese's 200-plus-minute focus on Dylan's earliest years allows for a portrayal of unprecedented depth, with multiple angles: a rich composite photo is the result. The main narrative has an epic quality: it moves from Dylan growing up in cold-war Minnesota through Greenwich Village coffeehouses and the Newport Folk Festival, climaxing in the controversial 1966 U.K. tour that crowned a period of unbridled and explosive creativity. In his transition from Robert Allen Zimmerman to Bob Dylan, we observe him concocting his impossible-to-describe, unique combination of the topical with the archaic, like an ancient oracle. Scorsese was able to access previously unseen footage from the Dylan archives, including performances, press conferences, and recording sessions. He also uses interviews with Dylan's friends, ex-friends, and fellow artists, and, intriguingly, with the notoriously reclusive Dylan himself (who looks back to provide glosses on the early years), fusing what could have turned into a tiresome series of digressions and tangents into a powerful whole as enlightening, eccentric, contradictory, and ultimately irreducible as its subject.</p><p>Some of the deeply personal bits remain unrevealed, but Dylan's preternatural self-assurance acquires a slightly self-deprecating, even comic edge via some of his reflective comments. Alongside the arrogance, we see touching moments of the young artist's reverence for Woody Guthrie and Johnny Cash. Joan Baez, in a poignant confessional mood, comes off well, and the late Allen Ginsberg is so seraphically charming he almost steals the show a few times. A crucial throughline is Dylan's hunger for recognition and ability to shape perceptions so that would be singled out as not just another dime-a-dozen folk singer. It's illuminating--particularly for those familiar with the artist's latter-day aloofness on stage--to see his reactions to audience booing in the wake of his \"betrayal\" in this fuller context. No Direction Home also makes clear--in a way that wasn't possible in D.A. Pennebaker's iconic Don't Look Back--how Dylan's ability to manipulate his persona always, at its core, protects the urge for expression: Dylan's ultimate mandate, as an artist, is never to be pinned down. As Scorsese masterfully shows, the myth around Dylan only grows bigger the more we discover about him.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thomas May</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The seventh volume of Bob Dylan's Bootleg Series doubles as the soundtrack to No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's feature-length documentary covering Dylan's career from its beginnings to 1966 (it was aired in two parts on PBS in September 2005 and released in expanded form on DVD that same month). Unlike the previous three installments of The Bootleg Series, which focused exclusively on live concerts, No Direction Home is assembled from a variety of sources, including home recordings, publishing demos, alternate studio takes, and live recordings, with the first disc devoted to early acoustic recordings and the second to electric music. In fact, No Direction Home proceeds chronologically, filling in gaps between the proper albums or, more often, providing a parallel history of the most productive era of Dylan's career. All of this material - with the exception of \"Song to Woody,\" taken from his debut, and a cataclysmic version of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" taken from the Royal Albert Hall show that was released as The Bootleg Series, Vol. 4 - is previously unreleased, and much of it has not been widely bootlegged (and the cuts that have been bootlegged, such as \"Dink's Song,\" have never been heard in such crystal-clear fidelity). Where the inaugural edition of The Bootleg Series had many previously unreleased Dylan originals, there is only one here, the tentative opener, \"When I Got Troubles,\" a sweet, simple 1959 song that finds Dylan in his formative stage. In place of unheard songs are a slew of alternate versions of familiar tunes. On the first disc, these are largely live versions of such warhorses as \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" \"Masters of War,\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,\" recorded when the songs were still fresh. These live performances have an immediacy and intimacy that not only illustrate what a powerful folksinger Dylan was, but also suggest how the songs might have sounded when they were new tunes. Toward the end of the first disc, alternate versions that are significantly different from the final versions begin to surface with an early take on \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" recorded at the Another Side of Bob Dylan sessions with Ramblin' Jack Elliott on second guitar and backing vocals. The second disc has several alternates that are similarly notably different, highlighted by a lively, careening \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\" with a different final verse, a \"Desolation Row\" with electric guitar, \"Highway 61 Revisited\" without the siren whistle, a slower, heavier, blusier take on \"Leopard-Skin Pill Box Hat,\" a relaxed version of \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\" that lacks the carnivalesque swirl of sound from the Blonde on Blonde version, and a lean, insistent \"Visions of Johanna.\"</p><p>As different as some of these versions are, there are no great revelations here, apart from the realization that the best takes really did make the finished records. But looking for revelations on this seventh edition of The Bootleg Series may be setting the bar too high, particularly because even if few things here are earth-shaking (a rampaging \"Maggie's Farm\" from Dylan's legendary electric set at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 could qualify, thanks in great deal to an incendiary Mike Bloomfield), everything here is uniformly excellent and worth hearing well more than once. That alone, of course, would make this yet another worthwhile addition to any serious Dylan collection, but what makes No Direction Home noteworthy as an album is that it is the first Dylan record to offer an aural biography of Dylan. This does a superb job of tracing the development of Dylan as a musician, taking him from a young folkie singing standards, through the rush of his early standards, and to the visionary music he made once he went electric. Put in this context, the electric music on disc two sounds as bracing and brilliant and surprising as it did in the '60s, while the acoustic folk on disc one sounds vibrant, pure, and alive. After all these years, that's a hard accomplishment to pull off, and to the credit of everybody involved in this terrific release, they've been able to make even the most familiar Dylan tunes feel new again.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>In his 2004 memoir Chronicles, Bob Dylan writes of his time in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s: \"Down in the Village, nothing seemed wrong. Life was not complex. Everybody was looking for openings. Some would get 'em and they'd be gone and others never did. Mine was coming, but just not yet.\" No Direction Home traces Dylan's career from the summer of 1961 (when Dylan first moved to New York) through the 1966 release of Blonde on Blonde, and doubles as the soundtrack to the Martin Scorsese documentary of the same name, which will be aired on PBS later this month.</p><p>Unlike the previous three installments of the Bootleg Series, which captured complete live performances, No Direction Home is a collection of demos, alternate takes, and live recordings, ranging from a barely audible \"When I Got Trouble\", recorded in 1959 by one of Dylan's high school classmates (making it, in all probability, the first original song Dylan ever laid to tape, all strummy guitar and dim, somersaulting blues-vocals) to the raucous, full-band explosion of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (the infamous \"Judas!\" version, which also appeared on the fourth volume of the Bootleg Series, Live 1966). The songs are laid out chronologically, designed to let listeners see exactly how far Bob Dylan came in six years. 2005 has seen a new glut of Dylan insight, and Chronicles, No Direction Home, and Live at the Gaslight 1962 (a companion piece to No Direction Home, presently available only at your local Starbucks, and sadly worth the stench of burned milk and spilled espresso) are impossibly telling when swallowed together: the end result is a comprehensive glimpse into Dylan-at-21, an oddly detailed examination of a perpetually misunderstood artist.</p><p>\"This Land Is Your Land\", recorded in 1961 at New York's Carnegie Chapter Hall (little sister to the famed concert space) is an earnest homage to Dylan's beloved muse Woody Guthrie, growled with endearing conviction. \"This Land\" is followed by a wobbly-voiced \"Song to Woody\" (\"I'm singing you this song, but I can't sing enough/ 'Cause there's not many men who've done the things that you've done\"); Dylan's unfettered admiration for Guthrie's work is perfectly (and prominently) posed, captured six years before Dylan perched himself on Guthrie's deathbed. Both feature Dylan's early caw and watchful strums, his veneration for Guthrie's politics and practices heartbreakingly rendered.</p><p>Dylan has always been an especially convincing protest singer, and given the post-Katrina events of the last week, his heartfelt rendition of \"This Land is Your Land\" is almost too much to take: it may be every Kindergarten class' premier singalong, but \"This Land\" is still one of the most elegant and subversive folk songs ever written. Guthrie's anthem was scribbled in terse response to Irving Berlin's comparably one-sided \"God Bless America,\" and the song's telling fourth verse (typically censored in service of patriotism) seems just as apt now as it did in 1940: \"One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple/ By the Relief Office I saw my people/ As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering/ If God Blessed America for me.\" Appropriately, \"Song to Woody\" features Dylan's response: \"It's sick and it's hungry/ It's tired and it's torn/ It looks like it's dying and its hardly been born/ But hey Woody Guthrie, I know that you know.\" Guthrie and Dylan's distress is palpable, thick: Nudge your dial, put CNN on mute, and sob yourself to sleep. (Don't stop when you get to \"Masters of War\", or, worst of all, \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\").</p><p>An early demo of \"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\" (sometimes circulated as a part of the Witmark Demos) sees Dylan cawing with atypical prettiness, his guitar nimble and soft. Recorded in Lou Levy's office at Columbia (\"I opened my guitar case, took the guitar out and began fingering the strings. Lou had put a microphone on the desk in front of me and plugged the cord into one of the tape recorders, all the while chomping on a big, exotic stogie,\" Dylan writes), \"Don't Think Twice\" justifies the purchase price of No Direction Home all on its own: Levy had Dylan recording original songs, which would eventually be transposed into sheet music and offered around to other artists, Brill Building-style. Accordingly, Dylan seems less concerned with perpetuating his own mythology than with capturing the grim soul of the song, and we're rewarded with three and a half minutes of pure, un-smirking, alarmingly honest Dylan (read: three minutes more than usual).</p><p>Disc Two features some outstandingly weird studio outtakes, including Take 9 of Highway 61 Revisited's \"Tombstone Blues\", complete with loping fuzztone bass, backing vocals, noodling by guitarist Mike Bloomfield of the Butterfield Band, and Dylan's own giggles. Largely electric, Disc Two also offers a source-tape recording of Dylan's infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival performance of \"Maggie's Farm\", where he plugged-in, brazenly defaming the acoustic-only preservationists present, most of whom had comprised much of his fanbase (supposedly, Pete Seeger was hovering nervous backstage, muttering to himself and threatening to cut the power lines.) The Newport Folk Festival had long admitted a thorny relationship with amplifiers, even when the music demanded magnification&mdash;festival organizers often stuck howling blues musicians with tiny, whispering stacks, smugly denying their right to wail. Even though Dylan had released the largely electric Bringing It All Back Home earlier that year, \"Maggie's Farm\" was ultimately received with a mixture of limp, knee-jerk applause and wildly dissatisfied boos&mdash;and folk music changed.</p><p>No Direction Home is fairly essential listening for Dylan enthusiasts and an interesting history lesson for everyone else. Not only is American politics skewered and forked apart, but one songwriter's artistic evolution is laid out bare. As ever, Dylan reminds us that there is plenty left to learn.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Sometimes, a first take satisfied him &mdash; \"Maggie's Farm\" and \"Gates of Eden\" are two prime examples &mdash; but often he'd find he could do a song better or at least do it differently, swapping out words, speeding up the tempo, and changing the feel, occasionally radically transforming his song. Sometimes, these radical transformations are the versions that found their way to the finished record, so they're now seen as etched in stone but The Cutting Edge 1965-1966, the 12th volume of The Bootleg Series, shows Dylan didn't enter the studio with posterity in mind when he went to cut Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde: he was making music of and for the moment.</p><p>Familiarity hasn't necessarily dulled the impact of these three records, all written and recorded within a span of 14 months &mdash; a period of time when Dylan also filmed Don't Look Back, electrified the Newport Folk Festival, and was declared a Judas at the Royal Albert Hall &mdash; but they have made them seem inevitable, works carved out of granite whose fates were preordained. The gift of The Cutting Edge is that it makes this, the greatest run of creativity in Dylan's career and perhaps in rock & roll in general, once again seems wild, nervy, and quicksilver, upending expectations and undercutting conventions. Within one of the three sets of liner notes, Bill Flanagan calls these six discs of outtakes, alternates, and rehearsals \"work tapes,\" which is technically true, but undersells how this music crackles as it shape-shifts, sometimes soaring, sometimes stumbling, but always feeling fiercely alive. If it's difficult to claim that a solo \"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\" and a locomotive \"Visions of Johanna\" recorded with the Band are superior to the versions on Home and Blonde, they're nevertheless magnificent in their own right while also shedding light on how Dylan worked; with producer Tom Wilson, the singer/songwriter wasted no time, while Bob Johnston allowed Bob to twist and test his songs, letting him discover the soul that lay within. Along the way, Dylan was truly fearless &mdash; he'd goose a tempo to see if it gave a ballad life, he'd let Mike Bloomfield and Robbie Robertson run wild; the fact that he abandoned a song as wonderful as \"She's Your Lover Now,\" possibly because it never quite withstood such stress tests, speaks volumes &mdash; and among the many gifts The Cutting Edge has to offer is that it illuminates these three great records while also illustrating that they were just mere snapshots in time. By breaking down the barriers that separated these three albums, The Cutting Edge shows how for Dylan during this blinding, brilliant peak his music was a living thing, evolving from song to song, take to take, where the quest itself was as transcendent as the final destination.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Tomorrow may be a long time, as Bob Dylan once sang, but listening through The Cutting Edge it's hard to remember that the brash, aggressive, thin wild mercury sound of the music it captures is half a century old.</p><p>The Cutting Edge, the 12th Bob Dylan release in the Bootleg Series, is comprised of studio outtakes from the three albums—Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde—that Dylan recorded during an unprecedented creative spree in 1965 and 1966. Following on the heels of his first four critically acclaimed solo acoustic albums that featured such enduring songs as \"The Times They Are A-Changin',\" \"Blowing in the Wind\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\" this newest full-band electric music driven by Dylan's surrealistic amphetamine-charged lyrics left many of his earlier fans scratching their heads—if not completely in the dust. This abrupt stylistic change that was most famously exemplified by the violent reaction to his performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 had far more to do with Dylan's abandonment of traditional song and lyrical structure than his decision to use electric instruments. The expansive, heartfelt anthems like \"Masters of War\" and \"With God On Our Side\" that his earlier fans loved had been replaced by stream-of-consciousness rants like \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" and \"Visions Of Johanna,\" an opus from Blonde on Blonde.</p><p>In the 14 months between March 1965 and May 1966 with the release of three hastily recorded albums, Dylan successfully kicked the shit out of every pop paradigm that existed at the time. By performing material with vocals that were often cutting and abrasive and lyrics that were indirect and suggestive rather than direct and cloying, and composing musical scores that sounded as if they were played by a Salvation Army Band on acid, it often appeared as if Dylan was daring his fans to try and keep up with him.</p><p>The level of intensity that Dylan built during this time could not last indefinitely. The constant recording and seemingly endless touring schedule he had taken on began to take their toll, and when a motorcycle accident sidelined the artist in the summer of 1966, many people came to see this misfortune as an indirect blessing that may have saved his life. In any case, it was a full two years before Dylan returned to the recording studio in 1968 to record John Wesley Harding, a more acoustic album that some saw as a welcome return to form.</p><p>Whatever divine intervention may have been involved in pulling the young Bob Dylan back from the precipice in 1966, and however great and profound his work in the intervening years may have been (I personally think a lot of his best recordings date from the past 15 years), it's still difficult to assimilate—even from the distance of a half century—just how important and culturally significant his three albums from 1965 and 1966 were. This newest Bootleg Series release goes a long way towards explicating this.</p><p>One of the difficulties in putting together a collection like The Cutting Edge is that for people of a certain generation, many of the songs are very familiar, which undoubtedly made it challenging for the compilers to showcase them in a way that is fresh and engaging. This is especially true with a compilation like this one that presents multiple versions of the same song in consecutive order. With this in mind and realizing that there are varying levels of appetite and obsession when it comes to Bob Dylan's music, three distinct versions of The Cutting Edge are available. The first, a \"best of,\" selects the most interesting and fully realized demos and rehearsals to give an abbreviated insight into the creative journey that resulted in Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde. On the other side of the spectrum, there's an 18-disc Collector's Edition that includes every note (copious warts and all) that Dylan recorded in the studio in 1965 and 1966. It is an amazing document and reference material, and as a chronicle of artistic process, it is absolutely unrivaled. But, for most people's needs and tastes, and in terms of an enjoyable listening experience, the six-CD Deluxe Edition is probably the best way to go. As with the Collector's Edition, it features multiple versions of the same songs, studio one-offs, jams, rehearsals and instrumentals. The entire fourth disc is dedicated to chronicling the recording of \"Like A Rolling Stone\" with a staggering 20 versions of the song presented that trace its development from a 3/4 time solo piano waltz to the six-minute full band single that changed the face of rock music. For the most part, the other five discs in this edition offer representative versions of different songs with just enough depth to satisfy and enlighten all but the most dedicated Dylan completist.</p><p>The chronological flow of songs from the original sessions has been maintained, which establishes a fascinating story arc that is helped along by all of the conversations between Dylan and his producers, Tom Wilson and Bob Johnson, that precede many of the tracks. Dylan's speaking voice reminds the listener how young he was when he recorded these songs. It is sometimes an uncomfortable, almost voyeuristic experience to listen to him bounce between arrogance and frailty as he complains about wanting to go home or not wanting to sing, often before completely nailing the arrangement of a song. The whining, straining character the tapes present often seems completely at odds with the beauty and intensity of the art he's created and his obvious commitment to the material. Indeed, the most revealing thing about the songs on The Cutting Edge is that for a guy whose musical skills were often discounted, Dylan was unyielding in his search for innovative sounds and novel arrangements for his lyrics. This can be most clearly heard by listening through the four versions of \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\" that open the first disc. Though the changes the song went through were far less drastic than those he subjected \"Like A Rolling Stone\" to, it is wonderful to hear how the first solo acoustic demo version existed briefly as a duo guitar track before evolving into a restrained, almost elegiac full-band song. The overall effect of presenting the progressions that Dylan's music went through before its release is that it makes these songs we've heard a thousand times on the radio sound engaging and new. The other realization we form when listening is that, despite many arguments to the contrary, Dylan has usually known when he's \"gotten it right.\" No matter how much people enjoy listening to, say, the five versions of \"Visions of Johanna\" recorded with different instrumentation and tempos, the final recording that was chosen to go on Blonde On Blonde was the best one.</p><p>As is true of every one of these archival Bob Dylan releases, the photographs, commentary and essays—this time from Dylan scholars Bill Flanagan and Sal Wilentz—that accompany The Cutting Edge are worthwhile and informative.</p><p>If you've never heard Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and/or Blonde On Blonde, try them out first before venturing into The Cutting Edge. If you have heard them so many times that every note and word is already emblazoned into your soul, listen to these outtakes and rehearsals to remind yourself of that brief moment so many years ago when the influence of Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie gave way to the new ideas proposed by Allen Ginsberg and the Beatles. It'll take you back to that time when Bob Dylan burned the candle at both ends and right down the middle to blur the lines between pop, art and poetry to produce some of the most amazing music ever heard. Fifty years on, and we're just catching up. The songs on The Cutting Edge are just as brash, bristling and amazing to hear as they were when they were first unleashed half a century ago.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Douglas Heselgrave</strong></p><hr/><p>Bob Dylan was on one of the best creative runs in the history of rock and roll during 1965-1966.</p><p>The three seminal albums he released during those 14 fruitful months, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, revolutionized the music industry, and fully transitioned his sound from the dusty folk troubadour of the early '60s to the amplified, electric bard who helped shape the creative direction of the rest of that decade and beyond.</p><p>The exhaustive new box set, The Cutting Edge 1965-1966: The Bootleg Series Volume 12, provides fans with a comprehensive glimpse into the recording studio with Dylan and producers Tom Wilson and Bob Johnston during that productive time. And while casual fans might not need to hear multiple takes of \"On the Road Again\" or an entire disc filled with 20 fragmented run-throughs of \"Like A Rolling Stone,\" the point of this collection is to show that these transformative songs didn't just appear out of the ether for Bob Dylan. He worked tirelessly to perfect these songs. And it's a revelation to hear just how he got there, and the compelling missteps and musical frustrations he experienced along the way.</p><p>The distinctive reworkings presented throughout the set are easily discernable from the originals, especially for longtime Dylan fans who have grown accustomed to the traditional album versions over the years. The tinkering that Bob and his rotating cast of musicians did with these indelible songs - in tempo, tone, time-signatures, and arrangements  - proves that these were works in continual progress and motion, and Bob was in the midst of discovering what styles suited the material best. That trait is still true of Dylan as he continues on his Neverending Tour, playing around with cadence, structure and diction from night to night, still giving these timeless classics new life decades later.</p><p>One of the many highlights of this set is the humor and humanity that comes through in these recordings. Sure, the music that resulted from these sessions eventually changed the direction of music, but these versions provide an honest portrayal of the men and musicians who were making it happen. Whether it's Wilson giving the tracks playful names (\"Phantom Engineer Number Cloudy,\"  \"Alcatraz to the 9th Power\"), or Dylan getting frustrated that the drums on an amped-up full band version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" are \"driving me mad,\" and how he doesn't feel like playing \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" because it's \"such a long song\"— the listener is allowed inside those hallowed recording studios to witness Dylan's mercurial creative process and hear precisely how these celebrated songs of his ultimately came together through both hard work and happenstance.</p><p>Over the years, the pedestal Dylan has been placed on has grown loftier and covered in the superlative garlands of decades of hero worship. But lost within that adulation, you might forget that Dylan was only 23-24 years old during these monumental recording sessions. Like any young musician (even though Dylan wasn't like any young musician before him, or since), Bob was still in the process of finding his voice and his confidence, despite the fact that he was already considered to be the Voice of His Generation and a significant cultural mouthpiece of the Civil Rights Movement.</p><p>Even with those early accolades - ones that lesser musicians could have forged an entire career out of - Dylan wasn't interested in staying in one place creatively or repeating himself musically. These recording sessions show Dylan pushing his music in raucous, inspired new directions, while also taking substantial artistic and career risks that belie his young age.</p><p>A motorcycle accident in July of '66 would immediately slow Dylan's creative output and lead him to a more reclusive life filled with basement tapes, Nashville skylines, and new mornings. And during that down time, the music world was still trying to catch up to three albums that redefined rock and roll and cemented Bob Dylan's status as one of the world's greatest storytellers and musical mysteries.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Erik Thompson - www.lineofbestfit.com</strong></p><hr/><p>Since debuting in 1991, The Bootleg Series has become an essential archival library of previously unreleased Bob Dylan material. Some of the recordings have been widely bootlegged, but most have been unheard until their release as part of the series, and even those that die-hards knew about had never been presented in such pristine sound quality. Everything about the series has been top-notch in terms of quality control and presentation, from track selection, to sound, to packaging. The various releases have covered many periods from throughout Bob Dylan's storied career, and while some are more vital than others, all are worthwhile. They add an important dimension and scope to understanding Dylan's work that goes beyond just the officially released albums.</p><p>However, a collection covering Dylan's golden age, the 14 months that produced three of the most widely influential and celebrated albums in rock history—Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and the double album Blonde on Blonde—had yet to be unveiled. Until now. The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 is the volume that Dylan fans have been eagerly awaiting, and they won't be disappointed.</p><p>Fortunately for fans, the series' producers don't believe in half-measures. Fans can dive as deeply into these rarified waters as they want. There is a 36-track, two-CD edition that should be the go-to purchase for most fans (a beautifully packaged 3-LP version features the same tracklisting). It contains complete alternate takes and early recordings of many of the period's most pivotal songs. There's a six-CD version that includes multiple takes of many of the songs that will appeal the more serious Dylan fans who don't quite cross the line into obsessive. Of course, if you want the whole enchilada, you can smack down a cool $599.99 for the 18-CD edition collector's edition (only available at www.BobDylan.com, and limited to 5,000 copies) which covers all of these sessions in their entirety: every note that made it to tape that wasn't officially released on the main albums themselves. It includes numerous takes, false starts and breakdowns, including studio chatter between Dylan, his band and producers. There are 20 different takes of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" alone. That creaking sound you hear is the door to the vault opening, and the insides have all been pulled out for examination, cobwebs and all. If there is a Holy Grail for Dylan fans, this is it.</p><p>We're talking about some of the recordings that define rock 'n' roll: cornerstones of the genre. 1965 is the year that Bob Dylan transitioned from a folk singer to a rock 'n' roller. He plugged in with the opening track and iconic single from Bringing It All Back Home, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", and, to paraphrase D.A. Pennebaker, didn't look back. It was the first taste of an amazing creative run that produced many of Dylan's most beloved songs and catapulted him to the iconic status that he's never relinquished.</p><p>Obviously it will take even the most dedicated Dylanologists a long time to sort through the riches of the 18-disc version, so this review will focus on the two-CD edition. It will be enough for all but the heartiest Dylan fans, and it's a wonder in itself. Most of the tracks are complete takes, and they sound amazing. It's like an alternate \"Best Of\" from Dylan's most important period. We get to peer through the lens of history from a slightly different angle, 50 years after these recordings took place. It's a wonderful alternate reality in which all of these familiar songs are presented in various stages of completion, sometimes with startlingly different arrangements and variations in the lyrics.</p><p>An alternate take \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\" starts the collection, and it's a gem. It's missing the electric guitar counter-melody from the official release, which allows more focus on a terrific vocal by Dylan. The stunning piano demo of \"I'll Keep it With Mine\" is the same one that appears on the 1985 box set Biograph, but it's a welcome inclusion nonetheless as it's one of Dylan's greatest lesser-known tracks. Judy Collins released a wonderfully sprightly pop take on it in 1965, and two years later Nico recorded an austere cover for her Chelsea Girl album that more closely resembles Dylan's recording. The only other previously-released track on the two-CD edition is Dylan's demo of \"Farewell, Angelina\", a song made famous by Joan Baez (Dylan's version had previously appeared on the first Bootleg Series release in 1991).</p><p>An early highlight is an alternate take of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\".  A solo acoustic recording of \"She Belongs to Me\" is the song freshly baked, take one. Dylan would give it a swinging full band arrangement on Bringing It All Back Home but has played it live solo acoustically over the years (as on The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Live 1966 - The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert) but here we get to experience the song fresh from Dylan's pen, just as he was trying it out for the first time in the studio.</p><p>There are two version of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" included on the two-CD edition. First is Take five, in which Dylan and his band gamely try out a waltz version of the song that sputters out before reaching the two-minute mark. Thankfully Dylan didn't pursue this direction, but it's fascinating to hear nonetheless. Take 11 is complete, and it's obvious that Dylan and his band are finally getting the song where it needs to be. Although it lacks the ferocity of the final recording used for the single, it's getting closer.</p><p>At every turn, there's a revelation—for instance, the two-minute piano demo of \"Desolation Row\". Hearing this timeless epic in its early, embryonic form cuts through all the mythology and gives the listener access to Dylan's creative process. A mellowish recording of \"Positively 4th Street\", without the bright organ riffs of the single version, presents an interesting contrast, given the bite of the lyrics the sharpness of the final recording. One of the absolute highlights is take four of \"Just Like a Woman\", in which the song is arranged as an uptempo countrified rock and roll shuffle. Thankfully Dylan veered far away from this direction in the end, but hearing it in this form is interesting to say the least. The version of \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\" presented is the shambolic take three, which finds Dylan and the band still trying to find the feel of the song. It's relaxed and languid, and sounds like it should be rolling under a haze of marijuana smoke.</p><p>Much more focused is a fantastic recording of the Blonde on Blonde classic \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\", with only bits of harmonica instead of the fat riffs that wheeze through the final product, and with a different melodic take on the chorus. Take three of \"Highway 61 Revisited\" is a ferocious performance with Dylan fully committed in his vocals—it's worthy of having been released, and the absence of the shrill siren whistle on the final take is a bonus. The furiously hard-rocking \"Visions of Johanna\" with a much fuller band arrangement than the haunting, skeletal final recording is fantastic, a totally different vibe but one that works well. We get take six of \"She's Your Lover Now\", a song that frustrated Dylan as he tried without success to get it down. He'd eventually abandon it. The first edition of the Bootleg Series includes take 19, which is nearly a full version. The recording here is stilted and awkward—Dylan's frustration with his inability to translate what he is hearing in his head for the song is so obvious it's palpable. It breaks down before Dylan can finish it.</p><p>The recording of \"Tombstone Blues\" included has a markedly different vibe than what we're used to hearing, especially with the vocals. The final version is so blistering and jagged, it's interesting to hear the Dylan and his band working their way up to it. Not quite there yet, but they're figuring things out. Take 13 of \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\" is a slower, more relaxed reading of the song with an excellent vocal, but the delicate descending acoustic guitar and bass breakdown between verses breaks up the song awkwardly, sapping it of its drive and momentum. Again, it's Dylan and his band noodling through it, finding their way to what ends up on the final album. We get the first take of \"Absolutely Sweet Marie\", and it's not too far off from the final version. Take four of \"I Want You\" is similarly close to the final recording.</p><p>Thus the collection goes: classic song after classic song, presented in a different state of completion and sometimes with a wholly different vision. The fact that these versions do not approach the greatness of the final recordings is exactly the point. These are works in progress. It's a guided tour through the creative process that led to these landmark albums, with an excellent booklet containing essays, liner notes, details on the recordings, and beautiful photographs from the sessions.</p><p>Dylan's archival releases are among the best in the industry, and the sound clarity is startlingly good. If any era defines what makes Bob Dylan the greatest songwriter in rock and roll history, it's the three albums covered by these sessions. It's an essential, thrilling collection that is an absolute must-have for Dylan fans. And if you're not a Dylan fan, you should buy it anyway and hopefully become one. The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 is more than just music—it's cultural history of colossal significance. This collection is a resource that fans and students of Dylan's work will reference again and again as the years and decades pass and these classic albums are introduced to new generations of music fans.  </p><p>&mdash; <strong>Chris Gerard - www.popmatters.com</strong></p><hr/><p>After 2013's Another Self Portrait, and given the continued brilliance of Dylan's bootleg series in general, you start to get the idea that Bob Dylan has alternate versions of damn near every album in his career in the hopper. The Cutting Edge, gathering music Dylan recorded over 14 months in 1965 and 1966, for the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde, does not dispel this notion. The set exists in several editions (2xCD highlights, ultra-limited 18xCD complete, and this set, the deluxe 6xCD edition) and could conceivably be mined to assemble two or three alternate versions of each of those three albums.</p><p>Pick a random deep cut like Highway 61's \"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\", and it appears here in four versions, three of them complete. The five versions of Blonde on Blonde's \"Visions of Johanna\" total 33 minutes. No fewer than 20 of the tracks are given over to \"Like a Rolling Stone\", including the various rehearsals, alternate versions, false starts, and tracks highlighting the stems containing individual instruments from the master take. So The Cutting Edge is the last word on obsessive studio documentation designed for rabid superfans. But it also happens to contain an almost unbelievable amount of great music that, broken into more digestible portions, any Bob Dylan fan can appreciate.</p><p>During the period covered by this compilation&mdash;the transitional, acoustic-leaning folk-rock of Bringing It All Back Home, the gnarled blues-rock of Highway 61, and the Americana fusion of Blonde on Blonde, enabled by producer Bob Johnston and his Nashville session pros&mdash;Dylan recorded in a way that has become rare in the era of unlimited tracks and non-destructive editing: He got a band of musicians in a room and recorded live. In a 1985 interview with Bill Flanagan (who also happens to contribute an essay to this set), Dylan claimed, \"I don't think I knew you could do an overdub until 1978.\"</p><p>That approach partially explains why this massive trove exists in the first place. With the recent Led Zeppelin reissue sets, we were left mostly with early and alternate mixes as bonuses because the masters were carefully constructed in the studio from fragments. With Bruce Springsteen's ongoing archival series, he's been liberal about recording new instruments and even vocals in the present day to fill in blanks. But Dylan's alternate versions could more accurately be called alternate performances, meaning each one is unique. And given the way he refined and re-worked songs during this period&mdash;trying them with just voice and acoustic, adding a full band, changing tempos, time signatures, and lyrics&mdash;the different versions can be sharply different in mood and effect.</p><p>\"She's Your Lover Now\", a song recorded during the Blonde on Blonde sessions but not included on that album, is a good case study in what makes this set fascinating. It wasn't included because Dylan was never able to record it properly&mdash;it's a complicated song, with some unusual changes and held notes, and he and his band were never able to get through it without mistakes. Eventually Dylan grew frustrated and moved on. But it's easily one of the best songs Dylan had written to that point, meaning it's one of the best songs he's ever written period, an alternately hilarious and pained story of a guy, his ex-girlfriend, and her new boyfriend encountering each other at a party. The title refrain basically amounts to Dylan saying \"You deal with it&mdash;she's your problem now,\" and his disdain for the new guy reinforces how much it still hurts, and how he thinks this dude isn't anywhere nearly enough for her (\"And you&mdash;just what do you do anyway?\"). Songs this rich were coming fast and hard for Dylan during this period, and \"She's Your Lover Now\" is so powerful it's almost a shock to the system when it breaks down after six minutes, a bum note and everyone stops playing, and you are reminded that they were living inside this song and the famously oblique \"wild mercury sound\" Dylan hoped to conjure at the exact same moment.</p><p>One of the main points of Greil Marcus' book on \"Like a Rolling Stone\" is that the song could have been many things, but what it was owed a lot to chance. Dylan recorded it many times but one take turned out to be the take, and the slight variations in phrasing altered how it was heard forevermore. That quality, of all the possible worlds these new versions suggest, animates the set. What if \"Like a Rolling Stone\" had been a slow waltz? What if \"Leopard-Skin-Pillbox-Hat\" was filled with goofy sound effects? What if \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" had been released in its full band version? (The recording of the latter ends hilariously when Dylan cuts it short and says \"The drumming is driving me mad! I'm going out of my brain.\") Some of the differences were subtle and some weren't, but the way this music has been pored over in the years since, none are insignificant.</p><p>These two years are Dylan at his wildest. He revolutionized popular music lyrics during this period, bringing in surrealism and romanticism as channeled by the Beats and making it work in a pop context. One of the things he inherited from the Beats was a belief in spontaneous writing and trying to take lyrics more as dictation. Which is not to say he didn't revise&mdash;he did, and often. But it's always been a mistake to put too much emphasis on the details of these words and what they might \"mean.\" Sometimes they were selected because a turn of phrase was funny, or because Dylan couldn't think of a better rhyme, or sometimes simply because that's what came out. Later on in his writing, he'd have discipline, but this is what he sounded like when he was free.</p><p>The structures of these lyrics probably owe something to Dylan's rumored drug experimentation during this period, specifically with marijuana and amphetimines. People on speed use a lot of words and cram them into spaces too small to contain them; they follow digressions and join phrases and ideas that needn't necessarily be joined; the desire to make illogical connections leads, on the one hand, to paranoia&mdash;you start to see things that aren't there. But if these tendencies can be channeled just so, they can lead to new structures. \"The sun's not yellow, it's chicken\" goes one of my favorite lines in \"Tombstone Blues\" (heard here in a complete alternate take and another partial version). Nouns and adjectives get chopped up and mixed together, the collisions of language leading to Gertrude Stein-like moments where you can feel your brain being rewired.</p><p>All of which is to say that the idea of \"Dylanology\" in the classic sense of decoding these lyrics to undercover what they might \"mean\"&mdash;Who is Mr. Jones? Where is \"Desolation Row\", what the hell are those jewels and binoculars doing hanging from the head of the mule???&mdash;is missing the important point: During this period, language itself was a playground for Dylan. The Cutting Edge is music of the present, but not the '60s present, an eternal present; the songs are about observation and they exist in a place where it's always now, in sound and word.</p><p>The music here conjures a feeling of acceleration that couldn't continue&mdash;Dylan's songs couldn't get any knottier or more surreal. The album after this one, John Wesley Harding, released in 1968 after Dylan's mysterious motorcycle accident (The Basement Tapes were recorded in between, but not released until 1975), found him heading in the complete opposite direction, stripping everything to the bone and writing with shocking economy and clarity. If everything up until this point had a certain logic to it, the hotshot young folk singer who is growing immensely with each year turns to rock'n'roll, after 1967 Dylan would be impossible to get a handle on. He had many brilliant records ahead of him, but he started to understand the precise value of theater and artifice. Here he was too wild and moving too fast to even figure out how that might work; he was a trickster, as witnessed in his infamous press conferences, but nothing was channeled into a specific direction: It was all blasting outward, in every direction, all at once.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Shepherded by the Band's Robbie Robertson, that 1975 double-vinyl inserted Band recordings where they didn't belong, suggesting the group were equal partners when it was really Dylan's show. The Basement Tapes: Raw rights this wrong, stripping away the excess overdubs and excising the ten Band songs -- a process which includes handing some of the tunes back over to Bob, including a wildly careening version of \"Don't Ya Tell Henry\" -- and then adding in all the major Dylan originals missing from the 1975 LP (\"I'm Not There,\" \"Santa-Fe,\" \"Minstrel Boy,\" \"Quinn the Eskimo,\" \"Get Your Rocks Off,\" \"Sign on the Cross\") and then adding hints of the covers and general madness that can be found in the complete haul. Naturally, some gems are available only in the big box, including a bunch of folk tunes, a rangy \"Big River\" and \"Kickin' My Dog Around,\" plus the goofs \"See You Later Allen Ginsberg\" and \"All American Boy,\" but that's the kind of stuff that seems better in context, when it's surrounded by the heavyweight songs showcased here. On their own on this superb two-disc set, those songs amount to a version of the Basement Tapes that not only represents what happened at Big Pink more accurately, but is a thrilling, endlessly captivating listen in its own right.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In 1969, an underground Bob Dylan album featuring unreleased material found its way into the world; 40 years later, the effects of this early leak are still playing out.</p><p>If you were driving around certain parts of southern California in the summer of 1968, you may have heard Bob Dylan's version of \"This Wheel's on Fire\" on the radio. KNAC in Long Beach, KPPC and KMET in L.A., KCSB in Santa Barbara, and KRLA in Pasadena were playing it in heavy rotation. A different version of the song was included on side B of Music from Big Pink, the debut album from the Band, which was released that July. At the time, the Band were mostly known for their Dylan affiliation-- if they were known at all. Dylan, of course, was the most highly regarded solo musician since Elvis, though he'd been out of the public spotlight for two years after a motorcycle accident. For many Dylanites, \"Wheel's\" suggested a return to the looser, harder-rocking Blonde on Blonde after the more reserved folk record John Wesley Harding, which was issued the prior December. It's likely that many hearing the song were under the impression that it was an advance single from a forthcoming Dylan LP. But why was the quality so terrible?</p><p>The small readership of upstart San Francisco rock magazine Rolling Stone were more clued in. Its publisher Jann Wenner had written a June cover story advocating not just for the official release of \"This Wheel's On Fire\", but 12 other songs that Dylan had recently recorded in a basement in upstate New York. In a lead feature titled \"Dylan's Basement Tape Should Be Released\", Wenner reported-- in a manner predicting modern music journalists filing copy after a leak-avoiding listening party-- \"Bob Dylan… made a rough but very listenable tape with thirteen songs… There is enough material-- most all of it very good-- to make an entirely new Bob Dylan record, a record with a distinct style of its own.\" Turned out that Dylan and the Band had set up shop to make a demo tape of new songs for other artists to record, and then circulated it privately. It worked: A cover version of \"Wheel's\" by English pop singer Julie Driscoll reached No. 5 in the UK that summer, Manfred Mann's take on \"The Mighty Quinn\" peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard chart, Peter, Paul & Mary hit the Top 40 with \"Too Much of Nothing\", and the Byrds' \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", a centerpiece of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, hit FM radio that April. Dylan's music was everywhere, but Dylan himself remained secluded.</p><blockquote>While history records Great White Wonder as rock's firstwidely circulated bootleg, underground releases ofits ilk are like the cool uncle of the digital leak.</blockquote><p>Was he retiring to start a lucrative career as a one-man Brill Building? Were these new tunes what someone would later call \"deserter's songs,\" a retreat from a political climate threatening to boil over? Wenner's column-length advocacy, along with the radio play of \"Wheel's\" and other songs from that demo tape, were working to push against this possibility, creating demand for what was called The Basement Tape to be released on its own. \"Dylan brings that instinctual feel for rock and roll to his voice for the first time,\" Wenner claimed. \"If this were ever to be released, it would be a classic.\" Columbia would release these songs, and they would be very highly regarded and commercially successful... seven years later, in 1975.</p><p>Instead, in June of 1970, fans got the double-album Self Portrait, which, although reappraised in subsequent years, did not fare well initially. In his Rolling Stone review, Greil Marcus claimed, \"Self-Portrait, though it's a good imitation bootleg, isn't nearly the music that Great White Wonder is.\" If you were a regular Rolling Stone reader, you were familiar with Great White Wonder--they'd covered it well. You may have bought a copy if you lived in L.A., or near an independent record store willing to stock it. While it's not part of Dylan's official catalog, Wonder did become a classic in its own right, though not as Wenner intended it to be. It was a demand-driven solution to The Basement Tape's scarcity. Great White Wonder was the first album leak.</p><p>Cheaply pressed as a double album in an initial run of 1 to 2,000 copies by two anonymous L.A. music industry insiders who went by Dub and Ken, Great White Wonder started appearing in record stores in summer 1969, the title gleaned from its plain white jacket, decorated only with a titular stamp. There were 23 tracks on Wonder, subscribing to a sequencing logic that is hard to pin down. Ten cuts were drawn from the \"Minnesota Tapes\", a collection of American standards Dylan recorded in May and December 1961. \"Only a Hobo\" and \"Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag\" came from 1963 Columbia demos, and \"Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence\" and \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" were great-sounding studio outtakes from the Highway 61 sessions. A version of \"The Death of Emmitt Till\" was pulled from a session with the folk magazine Broadside, and \"Living the Blues\" was recorded off of the television, from Dylan's May 1969 appearance on \"The Johnny Cash Show\". Wonder was a grab-bag retrospective of Dylan's career to that point, serving as something of a corrective to his absence and a harbinger of a career that wouldn't continue along the path it had taken for the first half of the decade.</p><blockquote>The low grade of the recordings on Great White Wonderonly added to their aura, and to the sense that fans werelistening in on a secret meeting between collaborators.</blockquote><p>Just those 16 tracks alone wouldn't have amounted to much, however. Alternate versions of already existing songs are a nice bit of collectible ephemera for die hards, but they're nothing compared to the voyeuristic and legally dubious revelation of new songs. Wonder had seven of them; more than half of the Basement Tape demos recorded just before Dylan left to make John Wesley Harding in Nashville. Along with \"Wheel's\", \"Quinn\", \"Nothing\", and \"Nowhere\", there was \"Open the Door, Homer\", as well as \"Tears of Rage\" and \"I Shall Be Released\", which had respectively opened and closed Big Pink.</p><p>In terms of recording quality, these songs sounded absolutely horrible. They were only intended as demos, and odds are the versions that were circulating had been dubbed numerous times, resulting in a significant loss of fidelity. But the low grade of the recordings-- particularly in comparison to the other, better-recorded songs on Wonder-- only added to their aura, and to the sense that fans were listening in on a secret meeting between collaborators. \"We went in with a sense of humor… It was all a goof,\" the Band's Robbie Robertson later told Greil Marcus. \"We were playing with absolute freedom; we weren't doing anything we thought anybody else would ever hear, as long as we lived. But what started in that basement, what came out of it… came out of this little conspiracy, of us amusing ourselves.\" This was the nature of a leak in 1969-- a rare glimpse into the backstage life of a superstar. A conspiracy built from a conspiracy.</p><p>In 1969, Bob Dylan was one of three artists famous enough to create the kind of demand required to trigger a leak of unreleased studio recordings (the Beatles and the Rolling Stones would soon both fall prey to now-legendary leaks). While history records Wonder as rock's first widely circulated bootleg, underground releases of Wonder's ilk are like the cool uncle of the digital leak. By definition, they're indistinguishable: recordings (live or studio-made) which are not released on the artist's label but instead sold or traded in ancillary or underground markets (Dub and Ken had a \"label\" they called TMQ, or \"Trademark of Quality\"). Fans had been trading magnetic tapes of already-released albums for years by this point, but Wonder was different: It was the first time that unheard recordings of a superstar's new compositions had leaked to the public, and were being sold. It's easy to take such a thing for granted today, when leaks circulate freely online, but Wonder represented the earliest moment when advancing technologies combined with popular demand and illicit entrepreneurship to create cracks in the record industry's otherwise firm facade.</p><p>Despite the fact that many copies of Wonder were pressed at professional operations, the quality was extremely poor: Oftentimes, the top layer of vinyl would literally scrape off after about 20 plays.</p><p>In 2012, a simple Google search can turn up Wonder in full via BitTorrent, with few worries about private investigators tracking your movements. In 1969, however, the stakes were significantly higher, and much more money was being put into Wonder's production-- and exchanged for access to it. Southern California record stores saw it flying off the shelves-- or, more accurately, out from under the counter. Dub and Ken were wholesaling the album just like any other, reported Jerry Hopkins for Rolling Stone in September 1969, charging $4.50 each and lowering the price to $4.25 after the first 50. A typical markup was $2, though some stores were charging much more. \"Those shops carrying the LP seem happy,\" Hopkins noted, \"with many reporting the album's arrival has had the same effect on business as a new Beatles or Stones LP might have.\" By October, Wonder had spread to New York, and the Times reported that \"at a small record stop near Columbia University, the proprietor just winked when asked where he had gotten the albums.\"</p><p>Dubs of dubs of dubs of Wonder, some with different track orders and most with different cover art, were proliferating through the underground. This is how Norton Beckman and Ben Goldman, two record store owners from the Fairfax district of Los Angeles, acquired their copies. They took an early version of the tape to an audio engineer in downtown L.A., who made acetates from it, which were then used to make \"stampers\"-- the master versions that were pressed to be sold. These were processed in the off hours of a record processing company-- \"one of the many in the city who ask no questions,\" Rolling Stone noted, then pressed and inserted into plain white sleeves at S&R Record Manufacturers in Gardena. Despite the fact that many copies of Wonder were pressed at professional operations, the quality was extremely poor: Oftentimes, the top layer of vinyl would literally scrape off after about 20 plays.</p><p>Beckman and Goldman became the target of Columbia's investigation into Wonder bootlegging. They were given up to Columbia's A&R department by \"an anonymous phone call from a woman who said she knew who the bootleggers were,\" Rolling Stone claimed. The woman was an acquaintance of the bootleggers, and was reporting them because the two \"had been bad-mouthing some friends of hers.\" Columbia was quick to make a public show of finding and stopping the Wonder bootlegs, though they had already proliferated far out of their legal control. \"We consider the release of this record an abuse of the integrity of a great artist,\" Columbia said in a 1969 press release. \"They are at one time defaming the artist and defrauding his admirers.\" But to many fans, Wonder was the opposite of fraud; particularly with countercultural vibes in the air, Columbia was the bad guy.</p><p>Though they had to make a public stance against bootlegging, Dylan's label was fully aware that their legal options were significantly limited. Columbia sent private detectives to uncover record stores selling Wonder and filed cease and desist orders against transgressors, but that was about the limit of their capabilities. They had no idea who Dub and Ken were, let alone where they were, so they couldn't serve the two pirates with a legal order. As Clinton Heylin observed in his great 1995 book Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry, Wonder's tracklisting might have seemed random, but Dub and Ken weren't dumb-- they made sure to craft it to fit in a liminal legal zone. Columbia couldn't verify if the \"Minnesota Tape\" songs were recorded after Dylan signed with them (and he was a minor when he signed his contract with the label, to boot). The traditional songs were mostly in the public domain. Furthermore, the Basement Tape material wasn't recorded in a Columbia studio, the Band weren't under contract, and Dylan was himself between contracts with the label. (For some inexplicable reason, Columbia failed to do anything about the Highway 61 sessions included on the album.) And Dub and Ken were savvy enough not to include Dylan's name or likeness anywhere on the packaging, so as to avoid a lawsuit over those aspects of his identity.</p><p>In the wake of Wonder, bootlegging flourished, though quality was never guaranteed. Devoted rock fans near in-the-know stores could rely on buying unauthorized recordings cobbled together from leaked studio tapes, audience recordings of live performances, and televised appearances from Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. \"In Minnesota, Come Back is being sold illegally,\" reported Rolling Stone in 1970. \"This is a poor quality copy of the Beatles' Let It Be album, due to be released God only knows when… Quality is… poor, as if the tape was recorded by a mike off a speaker, instead of directly dubbed.\"</p><p>Other bootlegs were of a much higher quality, and the practice was turning into a bonafide industry. Greil Marcus reviewed three bootlegs in a 1970 issue of the magazine: the Wonder followup Stealin', the Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto, and the tremendous live Stones LP Live'r Than You'll Ever Be (recorded and released by Dub himself). Marcus took into account the vagaries of quality as well as the content. \"Consider them new records by the Beatles, the Stones, and Dylan,\" Marcus wrote. \"They aren't going to be around for very long, and simply on the basis of their musical quality, they should be bought right now. None of these albums is a mere 'collectors item,' like the Great White Wonder stuff-- all of them are listenable and exciting on their own terms.\"</p><p>In early 1970, the idea of flooding the market with consistent streams of new material from huge artists wasn't part of record labels' plans, though perhaps it should have been. B-side collections and live albums were expensive to produce and publicize, and their market was still very limited, at least in the labels' imaginations. It must have been thrilling to hear what Marcus claimed was \"the ultimate Rolling Stones album,\" a high quality version of a show at the Oakland Coliseum in 1969 (which Marcus suspected was done from the stage by a sound technician, but which Dub confessed was accomplished merely by \"the Sennheiser shotgun pointed at the PA system\"). \"Whatever we take out of their pockets, we're doing as much for them in terms of publicity and interest in their music,\" one bootlegger told Rolling Stone, in language that echoes down to 21st century downloading defenses. He continued, asserting that the rules of market competition still apply in the underground. \"The word 'moral' doesn't apply. It's a matter of get what you can, and when someone else pops up copying our stuff, we do what we can to get more product at less cost. Maybe that's what the big record companies should do-- compete with us. They weren't going to release this material anyway, were they?\"</p><p>What happens with mp3 leaks illuminates a very basic economic fact: Official markets will always lead to unsanctioned ones that feed off of the legit products-- and often operate much more efficiently.</p><p>While labels tried everything they could (at least publicly) to stamp out bootlegging, the artists themselves were much more amenable to their existence. The Live'r boot was so good, in fact, that after the Stones' road manager heard a copy at KSAN in San Fransisco, he bought a copy for himself and five more-- one for each band member. When the entirety of the Basement Tapes was finally released in 1975, Dylan himself was publicly surprised at the reception and strong commercial showing: \"I thought everybody already had them.\" It makes sense that artists then and now would be more tolerant of leaks than their labels. While they need only concern themselves with making music to be discovered and heard by as many people as they wish, the labels have to foot the bill for production, distribution, and promotion.</p><p>On one basic level, what happened in 1969 with Wonder-- and what happens every day with mp3 leaks-- illuminates a very basic economic fact: Official markets will always lead to unsanctioned ones that feed off of the legit products-- and often operate much more efficiently. Consumer desire has never automatically limited itself to strictly legal operations, particularly when fans can convince themselves (often rightly) that they're doing no harm to the artists. In his recent book Pop Song Piracy, Barry Kernfeld pointed out that for as long as companies have been selling musical objects-- from sheet music to albums, cassettes, compact discs, and mp3s-- they have been faced with threats to their monopoly over distribution due to unauthorized duplication and circulation. Playing devil's advocate, since consumers are always encouraged to get the most product for the least amount of money and time, why should music fans make moral distinctions that capitalism itself doesn't?</p><p>Thanks to the unpredictable interplay of record labels, artists, laws, technologies, and music journalism, bootlegging and leaks can upend the the power structure when it comes to rolling out new releases-- but only the scope, not the idea, has changed in the last 40-plus years. In the late 60s, FM was still the Wild West compared to today's radio landscape, and rock journalism was in its infancy. Music copyright laws were full of loopholes, and duplication technologies were developing at an unprecedented pace. It was a moment when renowned critics would review hot new bootlegs, and Rolling Stone's publisher could openly lobby Columbia to release a particular Bob Dylan album. When record store owners could feel relatively safe moving illicitly pressed LPs from behind the counter, and radio jocks would play unofficial tracks in regular rotation. Labels filed lawsuits against bootleggers in vain, resenting a significant loss of control over their own operations, but often reaped their promotional benefits nonetheless.</p><p>And now: Bloggers and status updaters rewrote the guidebook for music journalism and promotion, leaving them in an unsettled state akin to the late 60s and early 70s (though now with much more gratis labor). Leaks are mass duplicated on the same machines that also serve as jukeboxes and publishing outlets, driving money not to labels or record stores or shady pressing plants but international file-locker sites like Mediafire, corporately owned ISPs, and proprietors of cloud servers. Fans take to Twitter and message boards begging for a leak of whatever new album has just been announced. And when these records are inevitably set free, they're often cloaked in the modern equivalent of plain white wrappers with a generic stamp-- .zip or .rar files renamed to travel online, unnoticed by label employees and Google-scouring security firms. Great White Wonder may be a modern impossibility in its original incarnation, but 40 years later, in a vastly de-industrialized music climate, its ongoing legacy suggests less a digital revolution than the mundane fact that, in the face of innovation, some old habits die hard.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Eric Harvey, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<P>The official release of The Basement Tapes -- which were first heard on a 1968 bootleg called The Great White Wonder -- plays with history somewhat, as Robbie Robertson overemphasizes the Band's status in the sessions, making them out to be equally active to Dylan, adding in demos not cut at the sessions and overdubbing their recordings to flesh them out. As many bootlegs (most notably the complete five-disc series) reveal, this isn't entirely true and that the Band were nowhere near as active as Dylan, but that ultimately is a bit like nitpicking, since the music here (including the Band's) is astonishingly good. The party line on The Basement Tapes is that it is Americana, as Dylan and the Band pick up the weirdness inherent in old folk, country, and blues tunes, but it transcends mere historical arcana by being lively, humorous, full-bodied performances. Dylan never sounded as loose, nor was he ever as funny as he is here, and this positively revels in its weird, wild character. For all the apparent antecedents -- and the allusions are sly and obvious in equal measures -- this is truly Dylan's show, as he majestically evokes old myths and creates new ones, resulting in a crazy quilt of blues, humor, folk, tall tales, inside jokes, and rock. The Band pretty much pick up where Dylan left off, even singing a couple of his tunes, but they play it a little straight, on both their rockers and ballads. Not a bad thing at all, since this actually winds up providing context for the wild, mercurial brilliance of Dylan's work -- and, taken together, the results (especially in this judiciously compiled form; expert song selection, even if there's a bit too much Band) rank among the greatest American music ever made.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P><HR><BR><STRONG>Wikipedia<BR></STRONG><BR><SPAN class=mw-headline><STRONG>The Story of the Basement Tapes</STRONG></SPAN> <P>In the mid-1960s, Bob Dylan was at the peak of his creativity, having officially broken into the mainstream with his popular and acclaimed albums <I><A title=\"Highway 61 Revisited\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_61_Revisited\">Highway 61 Revisited</A></I> and <I><A title=\"Blonde on Blonde\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_on_Blonde\">Blonde on Blonde</A></I>. In the latter half of 1965, during the interim between those two albums, Dylan began touring with The Hawks (later known as <A title=\"The Band\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band\">The Band</A>). Their live collaboration would continue into the first half of 1966, culminating in a legendary 'world' tour documented in <I><A title='The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._4:_Bob_Dylan_Live_1966%2C_The_%22Royal_Albert_Hall%22_Concert\">The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert</A></I>.</P><P>According to Hawks/Band guitarist <A title=\"Robbie Robertson\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson\">Robbie Robertson</A>, \"When I first met [Dylan] [in 1965], I played him this ballad from <A title=\"The Impressions (American band)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impressions_%28American_band%29\">The Impressions</A>' <I>Keep On Pushing</I> album, 'I've Been Trying,' written by <A title=\"Curtis Mayfield\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield\">Curtis Mayfield</A>. I said: 'They're not saying anything much and this is killing me, and you're rambling on for an hour and you're losing me; I mean, I think you're losing the spirit.'\" Whether or not Robertson's comments had any real influence on Dylan's decision to change his musical direction, within a couple of years Dylan would be writing quite different styles of songs.</P><P>On July 29th that year, Dylan suffered a mild concussion and cracked vertebrae when he crashed his Triumph 650 Bonneville motorcycle near <A title=\"Woodstock, New York\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock%2C_New_York\">Woodstock, New York</A>. He was taken to a local hospital where he phoned the members of the Hawks, informing them of his injuries. Dylan and the Hawks were scheduled to perform at several concerts later in the year, but with Dylan's current condition, those concerts had to be cancelled.</P><P>A little more than a week later, Dylan was back in Woodstock, wearing a neck brace and recuperating at a local doctor's house. While he was recovering, Dylan reviewed a preliminary cut of <A title=\"D. A. Pennebaker\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._A._Pennebaker\">D. A. Pennebaker</A>'s documentary of the 1966 'world' tour. \"They had made another <I><A title=\"Dont Look Back\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont_Look_Back\">Dont Look Back</A></I>, only this time it was for television,\" recalled Dylan in 1978. \"I had nothing better to do than to see the film. All of it, including unused footage. And it was obvious from looking at the film that it was garbage. It was miles and miles of garbage.\" Dissatisfied with Pennebaker's results, Dylan re-edited the footage into a surrealistic film, titled <I><A title=\"Eat the Document\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_the_Document\">Eat the Document</A></I>. (Howard Alk, who shot much of the footage, and Robbie Robertson also accepted Dylan's invitation to help him edit the film.)</P><P>As biographer Clinton Heylin writes, \"in the latter months of 1966 Dylan was certainly re-evaluating where he had come to at the age of twenty-five, and reviewing the raw film footage [of <I>Eat the Document</I>] was only part of that process.\"</P><P>Dylan later recalled, \"The turning point was back in Woodstock. A little after the accident. Sitting around one night under a full moon, I looked out into the bleak woods and I said, 'Something's gotta change.'\"</P><P>According to the late <A title=\"Rick Danko\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Danko\">Rick Danko</A>, the Hawks joined Robbie Robertson at their house in West Saugerties in February of 1967. Nicknamed \"Big Pink,\" the house originally belonged to \"Rick Danko, <A title=\"Richard Manuel\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Manuel\">Richard Manuel</A> and <A title=\"Garth Hudson\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Hudson\">Garth Hudson</A>,\" according to Robertson. \"I think Levon eventually moved in there, too. I didn't live there, but the whole idea was that we had been living in New York City, and we ended up moving upstate really to get a clubhouse, a place where we could woodshed. It was a real clubhouse, and we were just like a street gang — only we played music instead of going out fighting. We would get together every day at the clubhouse, just like the Bowery Boys. And as soon as Bob got well from his motorcycle accident, he started coming up every day.\"</P><P>The date is uncertain, but sometime between March and June, Dylan and the Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions. Originally taking place at Dylan's house, \"in the equally color-conscious Red Room\" (according to Heylin), these informal sessions eventually moved to the basement of Big Pink.</P><P>\"We used to get together everyday at one o' clock in the basement of Big Pink, and it was just a routine. We would get there and to keep [every] one of us from going crazy, we would play music every day ... There was no particular reason for it. We weren't making a record. We were just fooling around. The purpose was whatever comes into anybody's mind, we'll put it down on this little tape recorder.\" That tape recorder was actually an old Uher that was used on their legendary 'world' tour in 1966. Equipped with a couple of Altec PA tube mixers and allowing up to three microphones to be input per channel, with four or five studio-quality Neumann microphones, the machine was operated by the Hawks' Garth Hudson during the recording sessions. Dylan would later say in 1969, \"that's really the way to do a recording — in a peaceful, relaxed setting, in somebody's basement, with the windows open and a dog lying on the floor.\"</P><P>For the first couple of months, they were just \"killing time,\" according to Robertson. Apparently, much of the early months was spent on covers. \"With the covers Bob was educating us a little,\" recalls Roberston. \"The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us — it wasn't the train we came in on ... He'd come up with something like '[The Banks of the] Royal Canal,' and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... he remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song — and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us.\" Circulating tapes from these sessions reveal a large, diverse number of popular songs, including compositions written or made popular by <A title=\"Johnny Cash\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash\">Johnny Cash</A>, <A title=\"The Stanley Brothers\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Brothers\">The Stanley Brothers</A>, <A title=\"Ian Tyson\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Tyson\">Ian Tyson</A>, <A title=\"John Lee Hooker\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker\">John Lee Hooker</A>, <A title=\"Hank Williams\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams\">Hank Williams</A> and <A title=\"Eric Von Schmidt\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Von_Schmidt\">Eric Von Schmidt</A> as well as \"sea shanties ... country tearjerkers, from pure gospel to morality tales ... material from the English and Irish dales, the <A title=\"Appalachian Mountains\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains\">Appalachian Mountains</A>, the <A title=\"Mississippi Delta\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Delta\">Mississippi Delta</A>, <A title=Nashville href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville\">Nashville</A>'s Music Row, and even <A title=\"Tin Pan Alley\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley\">Tin Pan Alley</A>,\" according to Heylin.</P><P>Dylan was soon writing and recording new compositions at these informal sessions. \"We were doing seven, eight, ten, sometimes fifteen songs a day,\" recalls Hudson. \"Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs.\"</P><P>Two of the first songs Dylan recorded was \"Tiny Montgomery\" and \"Sign on the Cross\"; the former \"rediscovered his flair for characters out of left field,\" wrote Heylin, while the latter \"captures the deathless fatalism of gospel and country Dylan was after in much of his later born-again albums,\" according to <A title=NPR href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR\">NPR</A>'s Tim Riley.</P><P>In a matter of months, Dylan would record at least thirty new compositions with the Hawks, including some of the most celebrated songs of his career: \"I Shall Be Released\", \"This Wheel's On Fire\", \"<A title=\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29\">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>\", \"Million Dollar Bash\", \"Tears Of Rage\", \"You Ain't Going Nowhere\", \"Going To Acapulco\", \"I'm Not There (1956)\", \"All You Have To Do Is Dream\", \"Apple Suckling Tree\", etc. At least two songs were co-written with members of the Hawks: \"Tears Of Rage\" with Richard Manuel and \"This Wheel's On Fire\" with Rick Danko. \"He came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?',\" recalled Manuel. \"I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant. I couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: 'Now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse'?'\"</P><P>In May of 1967, Dylan gave his first interview in roughly a year. He told Michael Iachetta that \"What I've been doing mostly is seeing only a few close friends, reading a little 'bout the outside world, poring over books by people you never heard of, thinking about where I'm going, and why am I running, and am I mixed up too much, and what am I knowing, and what am I giving and what am I taking ... Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for some of the things that happened.\"</P><P>According to Heylin, that someone expected to atone 'for some of the things that happened' was Dylan's manager, <A title=\"Albert Grossman\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman\">Albert Grossman</A>. Within weeks of the interview, Dylan recorded a <A title=\"Bobby Bare\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Bare\">Bobby Bare</A> song that dated back to 1959. Titled \"All-American Boy\", it was originally a thinly veiled critique of <A title=\"Elvis Presley\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley\">Elvis Presley</A>'s notorious manager, Colonel Tom Parker, but Dylan rewrote some of the verses, adding some personal references regarding his relationship with Grossman.</P><P>Though Dylan still owed Columbia one more album, he did not want to fulfill that obligation with the songs written and recorded at Big Pink. In fact, Dylan's original intentions for those songs remain unclear. At the end of August, ten of them were dubbed down from their original stereo recordings to mono and copyrighted by Dwarf Music; in January of 1968, Dylan copyrighted another batch of songs including \"Tears of Rage\", \"<A title=\"Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_The_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29\">Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>,\" \"Nothing Was Delivered\", and \"Open the Door Homer.\" Jointly formed by Dylan and Grossman, Dwarf Music was established in 1965 in order to copyright demos intended for other artists. In an interview taken in 1978, Dylan admitted that the songs written and recorded at Big Pink \"were written vaguely for other people ... I don't remember anybody specifically those songs were ever written for ... At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads.\"</P><P><A title=\"Peter, Paul and Mary\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter%2C_Paul_and_Mary\">Peter, Paul and Mary</A> were the first to chart with a Big Pink composition when they issued their single of \"Too Much of Nothing\" in November of 1967. Soon after, <A title=\"Manfred Mann\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mann\">Manfred Mann</A> topped the charts with \"<A title=\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29\">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>.\" When <A title=\"The Byrds\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds\">The Byrds</A> released their groundbreaking, country-rock album <I><A title=\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_of_the_Rodeo\">Sweetheart of the Rodeo</A></I> in 1968, they opened and closed it with \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" and \"Nothing Was Delivered\". In the UK, \"This Wheel's on Fire\" made the top 5 for <A title=\"Julie Driscoll\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Driscoll\">Julie Driscoll</A> and the <A title=\"Brian Auger\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Auger\">Brian Auger</A> Trinity; the song was also covered by <A title=\"The Byrds\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds\">The Byrds</A> for their second album of 1968, <I><A title=\"Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Byrds_%26_Mr._Hyde\">Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde</A></I>, while the Hawks — reunited with Levon Helm and rechristened <A title=\"The Band\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band\">The Band</A> — recorded their own version on their celebrated debut, <I><A title=\"Music from Big Pink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_from_Big_Pink\">Music from Big Pink</A></I>, an album that also featured \"I Shall Be Released\" and \"Tears of Rage.\" <A title=\"Fairport Convention\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairport_Convention\">Fairport Convention</A> would also record \"Million Dollar Bash\" on their celebrated third album, <I><A title=Unhalfbricking href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unhalfbricking\">Unhalfbricking</A></I>.</P><P>Eventually, rumors of Dylan and The Band's enormous stash of unreleased recordings began to circulate. <I><A title=\"Rolling Stone Magazine\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone_Magazine\">Rolling Stone Magazine</A></I> even ran a cover story in June of 1968, claiming that \"there is enough material ... to make an entirely new Bob Dylan record, a record with a distinct style of its own ... These tapes could easily be remastered and made into a record. The concept of a cohesive record is already present.\"</P><P>The fourteen songs copyrighted by Dwarf Music brought those particular songs into private circulation, as demo acetates were soon cut for those songs. With no planned release in sight, these demo acetates became the source material for a number of bootlegs, the first of which was titled <I>Great White Wonder</I>. Bootlegs had existed for many years, mostly among other forms of music, but with <I>Great White Wonder</I>, rock music had its first commercially (albeit illegally) available bootleg ever.<BR></P><P><A id=Columbia.27s_release_of_The_Basement_Tapes_compilation name=Columbia.27s_release_of_The_Basement_Tapes_compilation></A></P><H2><SPAN class=mw-headline><FONT size=4>Columbia's release of <I>The Basement Tapes</I> compilation</FONT></SPAN></H2><P>On June 26, 1975, Columbia officially released a 24-song, double-album titled <I>The Basement Tapes</I>. Compiled and produced by Robbie Robertson, eight of the twenty-four songs did not feature Dylan, and of those eight, only four actually dated from the Big Pink sessions. All of the tracks were 'remixed' to mono while Robertson and other members of The Band overdubbed new piano, guitar, and/or drum parts over four of the original Dylan-Band recordings. Furthermore, songs like \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"<A title=\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29\">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>,\" \"Sign on the Cross,\" and \"I'm Not There (1956)\" were omitted, and the rough, first take of \"Too Much of Nothing\" was used in place of the later, comparatively flawless take copyrighted by Dwarf Music. (Critic <A title=\"Greil Marcus\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greil_Marcus\">Greil Marcus</A> would later hail \"I'm Not There (1956)\" and \"Sign on the Cross\" as the best and second best songs, respectively, of the Big Pink sessions.)</P><P>Nevertheless, <I>The Basement Tapes</I> was initially hailed by critics, with <A title=\"Robert Christgau\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau\">Robert Christgau</A> giving it a rare A+ in his \"Consumer Guide\" column. \"These are the famous lost demos recorded at Big Pink in 1967 and later bootlegged on <I>The Great White Wonder</I> and elsewhere,\" wrote Christgau, apparently unaware of some of the changes made by Robertson. \"Because the Dylan is all work tape, the music is certifiably unpremeditated, lazy as a river and rarely relentless or precise — laid back without complacency or slickness. The writerly 'serious' songs like 'Tears of Rage' are all the richer for the company of his greatest novelties — if 'Going to Acapulco' is a dirge about having fun, 'Don't Ya Tell Henry' is a ditty about separation from self, and both modes are enriched by the Band's more conventional ('realistic') approach to lyrics. We needn't bow our heads in shame because this is the best album of 1975. It would have been the best album of 1967 too. And it's sure to sound great in 1983.\" Other critics agreed as <I>The Basement Tapes</I> topped <I><A title=\"The Village Voice\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice\">The Village Voice</A>'</I>s <A title=\"Pazz &amp; Jop\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazz_%26_Jop\">Pazz &amp; Jop</A> Critics Poll for 1975, beating out <A title=\"Patti Smith\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith\">Patti Smith</A>'s <I><A title=\"Horses (album)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_%28album%29\">Horses</A></I>, <A title=\"Bruce Springsteen\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen\">Bruce Springsteen</A>'s <I><A title=\"Born to Run\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run\">Born to Run</A></I>, Dylan's own <I><A title=\"Blood on the Tracks\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Tracks\">Blood on the Tracks</A></I>, and <A title=\"Neil Young\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young\">Neil Young</A>'s <I><A title=\"Tonight's the Night (album)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight%27s_the_Night_%28album%29\">Tonight's the Night</A></I>, the #2, 3, 4 and 5 ranking albums, respectively.</P><P>At the time, some critics lamented omissions like \"<A title=\"Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_the_Eskimo_%28The_Mighty_Quinn%29\">Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)</A>\" and \"I Shall Be Released\" from <I>The Basement Tapes</I>, but the double-album only represented a fraction of the Big Pink recordings, and sure enough, a nearly-complete collection of the known recordings was eventually bootlegged as a 5-compact disc set known as <I>The Genuine Basement Tapes</I>; this collection is the centerpiece of <A title=\"Greil Marcus\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greil_Marcus\">Greil Marcus</A>' well-known book of music journalism <I><A class=new title=\"The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Old%2C_Weird_America:_The_World_of_Bob_Dylan%27s_Basement_Tapes&amp;action=edit\">The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes</A></I>.

It's a warm, friendly album, particularly since Bob Dylan is singing in a previously unheard gentle croon -- the sound of his voice is so different it may be disarming upon first listen, but it suits the songs. While there are a handful of lightweight numbers on the record, at its core are several excellent songs -- \"Lay Lady Lay,\" \"To Be Alone With You,\" \"I Threw It All Away,\" \"Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You,\" as well as a duet with Johnny Cash on \"Girl From the North Country\" -- that have become country-rock standards. And there's no discounting that Nashville Skyline, arriving in the spring of 1969, established country-rock as a vital force in pop music, as well as a commercially viable genre.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

While there are only a couple of genuine classics on the record (\"If Not for You,\" \"One More Weekend\"), the overall quality is quite high, and many of the songs explore idiosyncratic routes Dylan had previously left untouched, whether it's the jazzy experiments of \"Sign on the Window\" and \"Winterlude,\" the rambling spoken word piece \"If Dogs Run Free\" or the Elvis parable \"Went to See the Gypsy.\" Such offbeat songs make New Morning a charming, endearing record.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Another Self Portrait, the tenth volume in Bob Dylan's official bootleg series, assembles a slew of unreleased tracks, un-and over-dubbed alternate takes, and demos, mostly from 1970's Self Portrait and New Morning sessions &mdash;they were recorded simultaneously and released within months of one another &mdash;and other material. Dylan restlessly dug into the fakebook of folk, blues, and country tunes that nourished him from the beginning. The few original songs are minor ones. Twenty-six of these 35 selections were recorded between March and June. Dylan is in fine voice and he tries on many: some raspy, others crystal clear, all of them bold. The interconnected nature of these albums is revealed with the opening demo for \"Went to See the Gypsy\" (used on NM). It's just Dylan and guitarist David Bromberg. (Another take recorded three months later features just Dylan on electric piano.) There are two undubbed takes of \"Little Sadie\" at different tempos; two of \"Time Passes Slowly\" &mdash;the first a basic folk-rock read, the latter an aggressive one with Al Kooper's B-3 swelling to a crescendo from the jump. Dylan and Bromberg, with Kooper on piano, deliver a haunted, undubbed \"Days of 49.\" Many of the unreleased tunes are gems. \"Pretty Saro\" &mdash;with Dylan in his cleanest Nashville Skyline croon displaying a real range &mdash;and the vocal and piano read of \"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\" are deeply moving love songs. \"House Carpenter\" is a high lonesome blues. The skeletal \"Alberta #3\" puts the versions from SP to shame. Eric Andersen's \"Thirsty Boots\" has Bromberg's spidery guitar weaving a separate lyric through Dylan's vocal. A demo of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\" from 1971, contains slightly different (better) lyrics. The stripped-down \"Copper Kettle\" stands out when contrasted with its released version. Dylan was impatiently experimenting with arrangements on both records, particularly the latter, and some don't work. \"If Not for You\" features a violin instead of George Harrison's guitar. The unreleased \"Working on a Guru\" is almost a throwaway, but Harrison's blues-rock guitar playing smokes. The alternate \"New Morning,\" with a brassy, Stax-style horn arrangement, is great, but the full orchestral overdub on \"Sign on a Window\" &mdash;complete with harp &mdash;fails, as does the spoken word with female gospel backing chorus on \"If Dogs Run Free.\" Arguably, of the NM material, Dylan made the right choices for the finished album, which doesn't make what's here less interesting. The remainder of these tracks includes \"Minstrel Boy,\" an unreleased Basement Tapes number, and two tunes from the Isle of Wight with the Band, some alternates of Nashville Skyline, and others from 1971. Another Self Portrait asks many questions, but there is one that hounds because it's unanswerable, especially in regard to its namesake: why did Dylan record all this material, in this way, and then release something entirely different? It doesn't matter. For fans, this is more than a curiosity, it's an indispensable addition to the catalog.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Bob Dylan (re)paints a masterpiece for the 10th edition of his Bootleg Series</p><p>I misheard Bob Dylan back in 1970 as I lay back on the single bed in my room at my folks suburban home in Marin County and listened again and again to Dylan's then-new and controversial album, Self Portrait, as it played on my shit Zenith portable stereo. There were no lyrics included with the album; no liner notes. Just a very long list of musicians who had played on it. Dylan sure wasn't offering any help in figuring out what he was up to, but then had he ever?</p><p>Self Portrait seemed confusing at first, a two-record set dominated by covers of other people's songs. Other people's songs? What the goddamn was the man who had intellectualized rock songwriting doing singing \"Blue Moon\" and ‘The Boxer' for God's sake?</p><p>It's fitting that I start this column with the word \"I,\" and that I'm telling you about my experience, the experience of one middle class 17-year-old boy who was ignorant of the history behind many of the songs Dylan covered on Self Portrait.</p><p>I didn't know B. Bryant, the writer of \"Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go),\" nor F. Bryant, who along with B. Bryant wrote \"Take A Message To Mary,\" (both songs included on Self Portrait) were famous Nashville songwriters Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who wrote hits for the Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, George Jones and many others. Or that \"Little Sadie,\" which Dylan claimed to have written, had been recorded almost 40 years earlier by Clarence Ashley. Hell, I'd not yet heard of Clarence Ashley. And who were the Lomax's, who along with F. Warner, were credited with writing the gold rush ballad \"Days of 49\"?</p><p>I was 17. What the bejesus did I know?</p><p>Dylan often sang in the first person. Nineteen-sixty-three's \"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\" begins with the line, \"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.\" His 1965 single, \"Positively 4th Street,\" begins, \"You've got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend.\" The opening track on Dylan's new album, The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969-1971), is a demo of New Morning's \"Went To See the Gypsy\" that begins, \"I went to see the gypsy, staying in a big hotel, he smiled when he saw me coming, and wished me well.\"</p><p>I, he, he, me and me – in the very first line.</p><p>\"I use I and me and you,\" Dylan told Allen Ginsberg during an interview in 1977. \"It's personal.\"</p><p>It's personal. Maybe that's what drew me to Dylan when I heard \"Like A Rolling Stone\" on the radio in 1965 and flipped out. There was the voice and the music of course, but the way he sang so directly to the girl. This was between the singer and \"Miss. Lonely.\" And it was on the radio!</p><p>So personal.</p><p>There are many layers to Bob Dylan.</p><p>But I digress and I owe you more regards what I misheard.</p><p>The original Self Portrait starts with a line I heard as \"All the tired horses in the sun, how am I gonna get any writing done.\"</p><p>Yes, I thought in 1970 as I tried to make sense of all those new Dylan recordings (24 tracks), after what Dylan's been through (the infamous motorcycle accident, the wall of hateful boos that greeted his switch to rock ‘n' roll, and all he'd accomplished including the recording of nine mind-blowing albums &mdash; most of them filled with his own idiosyncratic compositions), how was Bob Dylan going to write more songs? How could he top himself? Well he couldn't, of course. Yes I misheard, but what I thought was sung sounded like the truth. And if he was too tired to write new songs, well what else could he do?</p><p>What follows that song (which is sung by his backup singers – no Dylan vocal) is an album of Dylan singing mostly other people's songs. There are old songs (\"Days of '49\"), pop songs (\"Blue Moon\"), a few by his contemporaries (\"The Boxer,\" \"Early Mornin' Rain\") and a few of his own oldies but goodies (including \"Like A Rolling Stone\" and \"She Belongs To Me,\" as played at the Isle of Wight in August 1969).</p><p>Self Portrait was an album of songs Dylan liked, and to some degree, songs that had influenced or impacted him. Self Portrait was Dylan as reflected through the mirror of his taste. But with Dylan, nothing is ever as it seems, so at the same time he was sharing a bit of himself, he was also fucking with us. Or was he?</p><p>In his memoir \"Chronicles,\" Dylan said he was tired of being \"the Big Bubba of Rebellion, High Priest of Protest, the Czar of Dissent, Kaiser of Apostasy, Archbishop of Anarchy, the Big Cheese.\" He wanted to escape an image the media and the public had imposed on him. So, he writes, he did what he could to shake things up, including the release in 1969 of Nashville Skyline, an album of simple country songs sung in a smooth country croon we'd never heard before.</p><p>And he followed up little over a year later with Self Portrait. \"I released one album (a double one),\" he wrote in \"Chronicles,\" where I just threw everything I could think of at the wall and whatever stuck, released it, and then went back and scooped up everything that didn't stick and released that, too.\"</p><p>Only that wasn't true. Another Self Portrait is evidence that there were many other songs Dylan didn't release, plus alternate takes and demos. And while there's no reason to think Dylan wasn't trying to escape the ‘voice of a generation' straightjacket, the songs he recorded were no joke. This was no duck and cover operation. Critics and some of the public didn't get it, but so what?</p><p>In 1969, even before the commercial success of his country turn, Nashville Skyline (which reached #3 helped by the pop hit \"Lay Lady Lay\"), Dylan was continuing to experiment with country music, but was also looking back to the old folk music (always a source of inspiration), perhaps searching for a new direction &mdash; recording old songs as he did when he and The Band recorded The Basement Tapes at Big Pink in 1967.</p><p>Dylan first recorded 11 songs during three days of sessions in the spring of 1969 in Nashville. Then over three days in March of 1970 he cut over 30 more songs in New York with musicians including David Bromberg (guitar/dobro) and Al Kooper (organ, piano). What is hard to believe, but apparently true, Dylan sent the New York tapes to Nashville for overdubs by Charlie McCoy (bass) and Kenneth Buttrey (drums) and a bunch of other Nashville cats. \"He [Dylan] wasn't even there,\" Buttrey is quoted as saying in Clinton Heylin's \"Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions.\"</p><p>Self Portrait was released in June of 1970 and the critical response was deafening.</p><p>With that one album it seemed at the time that Dylan instantly lost all the credibility he'd earned the previous decade. His staunchest defenders turned on him. \"What is this shit?\" Greil Marcus wrote in Rolling Stone.</p><p>But not me. I wrote a review praising Self Portrait that ran in the first (and only) issue of a magazine I co-published and co-edited, Hard Road (published in July 1970). I ended that review like this:</p><p>\"Bob Dylan (Robert Zimmerman) has gone through many changes and this album is another change, another mood. Many people will dislike it because it sounds different than the Dylan they're used to. That's all right though because a few people will have moved along with Dylan and will really dig it.\"</p><p>Yes, I liked it then and I like it now.</p><p>Oh but things might have been so different if the recordings on Another Self Portrait had been released in Self Portrait's place. Though I still dig Self Portrait, the new album blows it away. Listening to Another Self Portrait is a revelation. Remember the first time you heard Blonde On Blonde, or John Wesley Harding?</p><p>Yeah, that kind of mindblower.</p><p>It's a joy to listen to the album. Each song, as it plays, feels like a wondrous and unexpected gift, followed by an equally wondrous and unexpected gift.</p><p>Dylan's voice is in your face from the first song. And you remember how there was a time when he could really sing. Once he had a voice as distinctive as the one Salinger used to narrate \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" Dylan used many voices in the ‘60s and ‘70s – he moved from Okie folkie to sarcasm-dosed rocker to Nashville crooner. All those voices are wonderful, so full of emotion &mdash; and they all sound uniquely Bob Dylan. Those voices, as much as his words and music, are why he is such an important figure in 20th Century music.</p><p>All of those great voices and more are on Another Self Portrait.</p><p>With Another Self Portrait we get a mix of the original Dylan songs that ended up on New Morning and his distinctive covers. Most of the 35 songs on the two CDs (there is a four CD version that also includes Dylan and The Band's entire August 1969 Isle of Wight performance, and a remastered Self Portrait) were recorded in 1970 during the sessions for Self Portrait and New Morning. There are also a few alternative takes from the Nashville Skyline sessions of early 1969, one from The Basement Tapes, two from the Isle of Wight performance, and two previously unreleased versions of songs recorded in 1971 for Greatest Hits Vol. II.</p><p>There are demos and alternative takes, but just as impactful are seven recordings stripped of the Nashville overdubs. Those songs (two versions of \"Little Sadie,\" \"All the Tired Horses,\" \"Wigwam,\" \"Days of 49,\" \"Copper Kettle\" and \"Belle Isle\") are heard here as they were recorded with only David Bromberg, and occasionally Al Kooper accompanying Dylan.</p><p>If I had to pick out one song to sum up Another Self Portrait, it's the here-to-fore unheard \"Pretty Saro,\" a video of which appeared online two weeks before the album's August 27, 2013 release date. \"Pretty Saro\" began life as an English ballad. The words to Dylan's version are similar to those recorded in the early-to-mid ‘60s by Judy Collins, Pete Seeger and Jean Ritchie, but the music is different, and so is the melody that Dylan sings with his Nashville croon. The song lasts just over two minutes, and it is as mysterious and all-consuming as the Basement Tapes' recording, \"I'm Not There.\"</p><p>It is a story old as love itself that Dylan sings to us. Down in a lone valley somewhere, \"a sad lonesome place,\" the singer is bidding farewell to pretty Saro, who he dreams of \"wherever I go.\" Pretty Saro won't have the singer because he has neither a big house nor the silver and gold he would need to win her love. Still, he tells us that if only he were \"a poet and could write a fine hand,\" that he'd write her a letter and she'd understand. \"But I dream of pretty Saro,\" he ends the song. \"Wherever I go.\"</p><p>The lyrics are beautiful and haunting, but it's not those borrowed words that have me listening again and again. It's those minor chords that Dylan has added, and the beautiful flights his voice takes. Dylan doesn't just deliver the words, he sings them, and there is an ache in his voice containing all of life's defeats. A red rose that has been stepped on, that's the lonesome sound of Dylan's voice.</p><p>If you liked the Dylan of The Basement Tapes and John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline and New Morning, you'll like Another Self Portrait. If you are of a certain age, it may remind you of how you felt listening to the above albums when they were first released. I remember the relief I felt when in early 1968 I listened to \"Down Along the Cove\" and \"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight,\" the final tracks on John Wesley Harding. Dylan up in Woodstock; Dylan looking like a country gentleman on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post; Dylan making laid-back country music. It felt right, and I too wanted to get back to the country, even though I had no country to get back to having lived my whole life in that house in Marin. Oh to have a cabin in the woods, a creek nearby, and maybe an old rusting pickup to get around in. The other records that followed – Nashville Skyline, Self Portrait, New Morning – contained music to accompany sitting on the front porch of that imaginary cabin.</p><p>At the time Dylan's country voice was reassuring, a retreat from the craziness of Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde On Blonde or an advance past that craziness. The songs on Another Self Portrait, and the way they are sung brings back the comfort I felt listening to those albums way back then. I guess it could be nostalgia, which I'm no fan of, but I think it's something else.</p><p>What I think Dylan accomplished on his post-Blonde On Blonde, pre-Planet Waves albums was twofold. Not only did he change his voice and give up (temporarily) the rock ‘n' roll he'd been playing since '65, but he simplified his songwriting. It isn't that the songs are simplistic – mostly they're as sophisticated, maybe more sophisticated, than his previous writing, but he dispensed with the surrealism, and the layers and layers of wild assets/images. According to Clinton Heylin, not long after his motorcycle accident Dylan told Allen Ginsberg \"he was writing shorter lines, with every line meaning something.\"</p><p>Dylan's own writing became more like the old songs. On Another Self Portrait we get to hear \"Went to See the Gypsy\" followed by \"Little Sadie.\" A bunch of Dylan songs &mdash; \"Time Passes Slowly,\" \"Only A Hobo,\" \"Minstrel Boy\" and \"I Threw It All Away\" &mdash; are set among public domain songs and more recent covers including \"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue,\" Tom Paxton's \"Annie's Going To Sing Her Song,\" \"Railroad Bill\" and \"House Carpenter.\"</p><p>Mixing it up as he does, we experience Dylan as part of the American folk tradition. Where once he sat at Woody Guthrie's feet, now he's Woody's equal. \"Only A Hobo\" is as sturdy a song as \"In Search of Little Sadie\" (which, by the way, is the better of the two versions of \"Little Sadie\" that Dylan recorded).</p><p>There are some fun ones here such as \"Working On A Guru\" which he recorded with George Harrison on guitar, and a version of \"Time Passes Slowly\" with Dylan and Harrison singing la la la la las. And as I keep listening, other favorites emerge including \"This Evening So Soon,\" which Dylan learned from Bob Gibson, who recorded it by it's real title, \"Tell Old Bill,\" in 1958, and \"House Carpenter,\" which Dylan probably heard performed by Clarence Ashley on Henry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music.</p><p>Another Self Portrait ends with a terrific version of \"When I Paint My Masterpiece.\" It's a solo recording with Dylan accompanying himself on piano. He sings a verse we haven't heard before: \"Sailin' around the world in a dirty gondola/ Sure wish I hadn't sold my old Victrola/ Ain't nothin' like that good ol' rock ‘n' rolla!\"</p><p>Yeah baby!</p><p>When I misheard the lyric of \"All the Tired Horses\" all those years ago, I guess I misunderstood. Dylan hadn't run out of ideas. He had plenty more songs to write, and write them he did. He's still writing them. And even so late in the game, I wouldn't think of giving up on him. Plenty of people have been wrong about Dylan in the past, as Another Self Portrait conclusively proves.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Goldberg</strong></p><p>It's a little hard for those of us who weren't there to understand the critical reaction to Bob Dylan's 10th album, 1970‘s Self Portrait. First, let's pause a moment to reflect on the fact that there was a 10th album already at that point, only eight years and a few months after Dylan released his self-titled debut. It was a busy time: he wrote and performed, culture was churning ahead and changing at what was then an unprecedented pace, and some people in the music world thought of him as a sort of leader of a new consciousness. Into this world he released an album called Self Portrait. One imagines seeing that title and expecting something deeper, heavier, some kind of reckoning with what has gone before. But what the listening public got instead was a mish-mash&mdash;a few original songs, a few live cuts, lots of covers, and a generally disjointed sound. It seemed slapdash. And it caused Greil Marcus, Dylan's best critic, to begin his review of the double album in Rolling Stone with the words \"What is this shit?\"</p><p>The latest entry in Dylan's Bootleg Series provides a new opportunity to evaluate the music of this period. Calling this volume Another Self Portrait, including liner notes by Marcus, and offering up a new painting by Bob Dylan as a cover image, is a sly and gutsy move. By most accounts, Dylan was hurt by the initial savaging of Self Portrait, and rushed out its 1970 follow-up, New Morning, to put the album in the rearview as quickly as possible. Later, there was a sense that he wanted to scrub it from his own history. In interviews, Dylan sometimes suggested that Self Portrait was deliberately bad, thrown together as a way to confuse his audience or provoke the media into moving on to someone else so that he could have more privacy in raising his family.</p><p>Though we'll never know exactly what he was thinking, the idea of Dylan making a poor album on purpose never made sense. He worked with too many top-shelf musicians that he cared about, and had friends and colleagues investing too much time, to make something that would embarrass them. It seems more likely that the \"intentionally bad\" storyline was a defense mechanism for a mysterious artist who did, after all, have a pretty hefty ego and was deeply aware of his own talent. So it's reasonable to conclude that Self Portrait was a strange and all-over-the-place album because, for one reason or another, that's the kind of album Dylan wanted to make at that time.</p><p>Another Self Portrait complicates the narrative. Considering the strength of these alternate takes, demos, stripped-down mixes, and live cuts, it's a little hard to believe that these were the cast-offs from what was perceived to be an artist's worst album. Many of the songs come from the sessions for New Morning, but there were no clear lines between Self Portrait and New Morning sessions in 1969 and 1970. Akin to Neil Young's later method, Dylan at the end of the 60s seems to have been about recording songs first, lots of them, and figuring out how they fit into an album later.</p><p>There was a marked shift in Dylan's music at the end of the 60s. \"For sure my lyrics had struck nerves that had never been struck before,\" he wrote of this time in Chronicles Volume One, \"but if my songs were just about the words, then what was Duane Eddy, the great rock'n'roll guitarist, doing recording an album full of instrumental melodies of my songs? Musicians have always known that my songs were more than just words, but most people are not musicians.\" This passage provides a good framework for understanding the music here. After the word-drunk work he'd created in the mid-60s, and following the mysterious motorcycle accident that laid him up in 1966, his music became simpler and more tuneful. Drawing on his longstanding interest in country music, standards, and any well-constructed song, he began to write and perform songs that felt universal.</p><p>That is where the deep and immense pleasure of this set resides: hearing melodies&mdash;some new, some old, some borrowed&mdash;performed by a distinctive singer at the height of his powers. The two discs are arranged for flow, with songs roughly split along two lines. Disc one is mostly songs recorded prior to Self Portrait, and is heavy on alternate versions of Dylan tunes and renditions of traditional songs. This \"Time Passes Slowly\" and the demo of \"Went to See the Gypsy\" don't supplant better-known takes, but they're different enough in feel and arrangement to make the songs sound new. Other differences, like the alternate version of Nashville Skyline's \"I Threw It All Away\", are more subtle, and the appeal is in hearing the song tinted by a new setting.</p><p>But the real revelations on the first disc are the unreleased versions of songs from the public domain. It's now accepted that Dylan returned to relevance late in his career when he released two albums of traditional songs, 1992‘s Good as I Been to You and 1993‘s World Gone Wrong. The idea being that, in times of trouble, when he's not sure where else to go, the songs Dylan grew up with and studied were there for him. The versions here of \"Railroad Bill\", \"Little Sadie\", \"Pretty Saro\", and the especially powerful \"This Evening So Soon\" are brilliant showcases of his ability to inhabit old material and make it his own. And they benefit from the generally spare and acoustic sound. Dylan started his career singing traditional folk songs, but his understanding of them eight years later was far richer.</p><p>The second disc is heavier on versions of Dylan originals, with roughly equal smatterings of alternate takes from Self Portrait, New Morning, and Nashville Skyline and live cuts from Dylan and the Band's 1969 Isle of Wight Festival performance. Some of the differences in these versions are striking. The radically altered take of \"If Not For You\" is performed by Dylan with piano and violin, making the song sound even more tender and vulnerable. There's an alternate version of the funky Nashville Skyline trifle \"Country Pie\" that, when it breaks down, shows just how in-the-pocket his session pros were when playing live in the studio. There's a version of \"New Morning\" with a shimmering horn section, giving it an even more buoyant and joyous cast. \"Wigwam\", the instrumental that was given a bombastic treatment on the Self Portrait album, is heard without orchestration, revealing it as an effortlessly tuneful cowboy tune (the countrypolitan near-instrumental \"All the Tired Horses\" is heard in a similarly lean version).</p><p>Most of the music is heard in versions with minimal instrumentation: Dylan's guitar, a second guitar adding fills, sometimes piano. Which makes the set oddly cohesive and album-like, ironically more so than the Self Portrait album itself. The outliers in this regard were also some of the stranger inclusions on the original album&mdash;the in-concert tracks with the Band. Given that neither Dylan nor the Band played live during this period, the fact that they came together for a massive festival was surely big news, so the set is obviously of historical importance. That is doubly true since by this time the recordings they made together in Woodstock were leaking out on bootlegs like The Great White Wonder, so the desire for Dylan/Band collaborations was high. But plucking random numbers from that Isle of Wight set didn't make much sense on the original album, and it doesn't make much sense on Another Self Portrait either. The deluxe version of this set includes a disc with the full set, which is welcome&mdash;it has a ragtag charm, Dylan mostly sings in his Nashville Skyline voice, and the song selection is ace. But there's still a weird distance to it all, a lack of intensity that is hard to put a finger on, with laid back versions of familiar tunes that don't really probe for any new meanings.</p><p>The deluxe version also includes a remastered version of the Self Portrait album proper. Returning to it, it's hard for those of us a generation or two younger to understand the reaction to it not because it paled in comparison to the greatness that came before, because it obviously did. If you've spent any time listening to Bob Dylan's 1960s catalog, you are still trying to wrap your head around the thought that one person wrote the 56 songs on Bringing it All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde, John Wesley Harding, and Nashville Skyline between 1965 and 1969. Self Portrait, next to these records, in that moment, must have seemed like a joke. But later generations hear it differently. We've discovered Self Portrait in the used bins, torrent downloads, and streaming services alongside records like Street Legal, Saved, Empire Burlesque, Down in the Groove, and Under the Red Sky. And in this broader context, it sounds quite good, another weird and sloppy record from a guy who released a lot of them. And hearing it again with all the fantastic music that surrounded it, music that further cements Dylan's Bootleg Series as one of the most important archival projects in modern pop history, it remains a beguiling artifact.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Dylan didn't want the record to be released, and it's easy to see why -- the album is a collection of covers that are poorly performed on purpose. Tackling both contemporary writers (Joni Mitchell's \"Big Yellow Taxi,\" Jerry Jeff Walker's \"Mr. Bojangles\"), pop songs (\"Can't Help Falling in Love,\" \"A Fool Such as I\"), and traditional numbers (\"The Ballad of Ira Hayes,\" \"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\"), Dylan attempts to sabotage each number, but none of the results is quite so shocking, or funny, as the deconstructions on Self Portrait. While Dylan is indeed a negligible album, it isn't unlistenable -- it has a pleasant pop/rock sheen and Dylan sings in his Nashville Skyline croon. Nevertheless, it adds nothing to his canon, and only die-hard fans with a perverse sense of humor will find the record worth a listen.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This album was unusual on several counts. For starters, it was a soundtrack (for Sam Peckinpah's movie of the same title), a first venture of its kind for Bob Dylan. For another, it was Dylan's first new LP in three years -- he hadn't been heard from in any form other than the single \"George Jackson,\" his appearance at the Bangladesh benefit concert in 1971, in all of that time. Finally, it came out at an odd moment of juxtaposition in pop culture history, appearing in July 1973 on the same date as the release of Paul McCartney's own first prominent venture into film music, on the Live and Let Die soundtrack (the Beatles bassist had previously scored The Family Way, a British project overlooked amid the frenzy of the Beatles' success). Interestingly, each effort reunited the artist with a significant musician/collaborator from his respective past: McCartney with producer George Martin and Dylan with guitarist Bruce Langhorne, who'd played with him on his early albums up to Bringing It All Back Home, before being supplanted by Mike Bloomfield, et al. But that was where the similarities between the two projects ended -- apart from the title song, Live and Let Die was Martin's project rather than McCartney's, whereas Dylan was all over Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid as a composer, musician, etc. Additionally, whereas McCartney's work was a piece of pure pop-oriented rock in connection with a crowd-pleasing action-fantasy film, Dylan's work comprised an entire LP, and the resulting album was a beautifully simple, sometimes rough-at-the-edges and sometimes gently refined piece of country- and folk-influenced rock, devised to underscore a very serious historical film by one of the movies' great directorial stylists. It was also as strong as any of his recent albums, featuring not just Langhorne but also such luminaries as Booker T. Jones, Roger McGuinn, and Byron Berline. \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" was the obvious hit off the album, and helped drive the sales, but \"Billy 1,\" \"Billy 4,\" and \"Billy 7\" were good songs, too -- had any of them shown up on bootlegs, they'd have kept the Dylan semiologists and hagiographers busy for years working over them. The instrumentals surrounding them were also worth hearing as manifestations of Dylan's music-making; \"Bunkhouse Theme\" was downright gorgeous. It was the first time since New Morning, in 1970, that Dylan had released more than five minutes of new music at once, and it was a gift to fans as well as to Peckinpah -- little did anyone realize at the time that it heralded a period of new recording and a national tour (with the Band), along with a brief label switch, and Dylan's greatest period of sustained musical visibility since 1966. This record also proved that Dylan could shoehorn his music within the requirements of a movie score without compromising its content or quality, something that only the Beatles, unique among rock artists, had really managed to do up to that time, and that was in their own movie, A Hard Day's Night. \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" may have been the biggest hit to come out of a Western in at least 21 years, since Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington had given \"High Noon\" to Tex Ritter to sing in Fred Zinnemann's High Noon in 1952 (and Katy Jurado was in both movies), and he'd also outdone Ritter on two counts, writing the music -- a full score, to boot -- and getting a cameo appearance in the film. The album was later kind of overlooked and neglected in the wake of the tour that followed and the imposing musical attributes of, say, Blood on the Tracks and Desire, but heard on its own terms it holds up 30-plus years later.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Following on the heels of an album where he repudiated his past with his greatest backing band, Blood on the Tracks finds Bob Dylan, in a way, retreating to the past, recording a largely quiet, acoustic-based album. But this is hardly nostalgia -- this is the sound of an artist returning to his strengths, what feels most familiar, as he accepts a traumatic situation, namely the breakdown of his marriage. This is an album alternately bitter, sorrowful, regretful, and peaceful, easily the closest he ever came to wearing his emotions on his sleeve. That's not to say that it's an explicitly confessional record, since many songs are riddles or allegories, yet the warmth of the music makes it feel that way. The original version of the album was even quieter -- first takes of \"Idiot Wind\" and \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" available on The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3, are hushed and quiet (excised verses are quoted in the liner notes, but not heard on the record) -- but Blood on the Tracks remains an intimate, revealing affair since these harsher takes let his anger surface the way his sadness does elsewhere. As such, it's an affecting, unbearably poignant record, not because it's a glimpse into his soul, but because the songs are remarkably clear-eyed and sentimental, lovely and melancholy at once. And, in a way, it's best that he was backed with studio musicians here, since the professional, understated backing lets the songs and emotion stand at the forefront. Dylan made albums more influential than this, but he never made one better.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>One doesn't have to be a broken-hearted straight male (or even a Nobel Prize voter) to fall in love with Bob Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks, but it might help. Filled with open-ended and often gender-specific pronouns, the yous, hers, hes, shes, and theys remain unnamed on all but one of the 10 songs on the moody 1975 epic, each a glowing invitation for listeners to fill in the blanks with their own nearest available emotional devastations. Often referred to as Dylan’s \"breakup album,\" it’s likewise become just that for many listeners, both expressing and absorbing great aloneness. Dylan himself professed confusion about the album’s popularity. \"It’s hard for me to relate to that,\" he said the year Blood on the Tracks was released. \"I mean, people enjoying that kind of pain.\"</p><p>But as plenty have pointed out in the wake of Dylan’s Nobel for Literature, his music is about far more than just his lyrics, and Blood on the Tracks is a prime example of just what that more constitutes. Beyond the emotional wreckage, Blood on the Tracks might be Dylan’s most welcoming LP, its music projecting an undeniable warmth. The disc-opening \"Tangled Up in Blue\" uncorks the feels via an experimental narrative that fights conventional linearity, but the reasons to keep listening are contained in the first 11 seconds of forward motion before Dylan’s voice enters. Only after that do lyrics even matter, and (on Blood on the Tracks, anyway) he is pretty fantastic at both.</p><p>Blood on the Tracks is pleasing and complete enough to visit repeatedly, until the syllables become words, the words resolve into meanings, and all of it becomes internalized, a space accessible even without the presence of the album. Perhaps the least dated of Dylan’s recordings, there is a nakedness to everything. Untainted by the politics and cool of the ’60s or the gated drums and overdubbed productions of the ’80s, Blood on the Tracks hits with the same immediacy in the 21st century as it did in 1975.</p><p>Just as much as Pink Floyd or any other mid-’70s LP-minded artist, Dylan uses the studio to create and sustain a mood on Blood on the Tracks, and this mood is what survives. Drawing from two sets of sessions and at least three configurations of not-fully-identified musicians to capture a singular batch of songs, the album is a full package of writing, performance, and atmosphere. Withdrawing an early version of the album on the eve of release, musicians from sessions in New York disappeared into the credit of \"Eric Weissberg and Deliverance,\" and musicians recorded later in Minneapolis received no credit at all. Though he received no separate title on the album itself, it is also the first album on which Dylan himself served as sole producer, assembling musicians on his own, sometimes to confusing effect. While staying within the parameters of folk-rock, Dylan finds a rich array of approaches, moving between the vivid brightness of \"Tangled Up in Blue\" and \"You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\" the soft-voiced late-night guitar/bass duets of \"Shelter From the Storm\" and \"Buckets of Rain,\" and the pained autumnal crispness of \"Idiot Wind.\"</p><p>\"Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan\" ran one of Columbia Records’ ’60s advertising campaigns, but by the early ’70s consumers were deluged with multiple generations of New Dylans, each expanding from territory that once belonged almost exclusively to Dylan, from Joni Mitchell to Bruce Springsteen, Leonard Cohen to Patti Smith. After a few years in the wilderness, when Dylan recorded for David Geffen’s Asylum Records (and Columbia released Dylan, scraping up unissued sessions without his consent), Blood on the Tracks might be seen as Dylan’s own assertion that nobody wrote Dylan like Dylan, either. For fans at the time, it was a revelation, both a few notches less cryptic than his ’60s surrealism, but no less mystical, folding in techniques of his old finger-pointin’ (\"Idiot Wind\"), blues-strummin’ (\"Meet Me in the Morning\"), vision-havin’ (\"Shelter From the Storm\"), and story-tellin’ (\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\") self, all while tapping into powerful new realms of vulnerability.</p><p>As a writer, Dylan had been through about three lightly overlapping phases over the previous 15 years—young and Woody (1960-1963), young and visionary (1964-1968), and young and happy (1969-1973), and Blood on the Tracks built on them while promising something more. Officially retired and raising children during the early ’70s, Dylan had deliberately downshifted into a less complex lyric style beginning with 1969’s Nashville Skyline, in part hoping to shake some of the obsessive global audience he’d attracted. New Morning and other country-pop sessions from the period found Dylan playing with some of the brighter textures he would employ on Blood on the Tracks, but his reluctance to write in the symbolism-laden voice of his earliest years soon resulted in a period when he \"more or less had amnesia,\" as he later told an interviewer. Returning to active songwriting in 1973 and the road in 1974 with the Band for Planet Waves, many of his latest songs seemed to lack the all-seeing perspective of his earlier work.</p><p>Dylan would say Blood on the Tracks was influenced by lecture classes he took with painter Norman Raeben in New York in early 1974. \"You’ve got yesterday, today, and tomorrow all in the same room,\" he said of the new lyric writing approach that resulted. Heard most vividly in the long-arc narratives of \"Tangled Up in Blue\" and \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" verses and lines present assets/images like shuffled postcards connected by what Dylan referred to as a \"code.\" It is here that thinking of Blood on the Tracks as a \"breakup album\" becomes reductive, missing out on much of what the collection of songs has to offer, the \"breakup\" as much a concept as the bandshell concert loosely framing Sgt. Pepper’s. Just as much as relationships are about more than their breakups, breakup albums are about more than their relationships.</p><p>Though the disintegration of Dylan’s marriage might easily be spotted in nearly every song on the album, there are also meditations on the ineffable passage of time (\"Tangled Up in Blue\"), a transitory love affair in the present tense (\"You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\") and media jackyldom and other bummers (\"Idiot Wind\"). For that matter, a full third of the LP’s second side is concerned with \"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts,\" a nine-minute 16-verse ballad that bucks the album’s signature themes of time regained, implacable loves, and unnamed names. Though remaining convincingly jaunty throughout with a light melody that catches the details in forensic clarity, its drawn-out story is a chore to decipher. Unlike the ambient emotional narratives of the rest of the album, the linear ballad requires a full and present attention, a reminder of one of the ways that music consumption is different than reading. Reportedly once considered for a film adaptation, the screen may’ve suited its stage-directed characters better than folk-rock. Further separating it from the rest, the blood spilled on this particular track doesn’t seem to be Dylan’s own, detracting from the album’s bigger picture and only underscoring the unifying power of the other nine songs.</p><p>Drawing on a range of songwriting tricks (including an open \"E\" tuning that assures that very few will play Dylan like Dylan, either), Blood on the Tracks emphasizes a feeling of raw expression. Singing live in the studio (with the exception of the overdubbed \"Meet Me in the Morning\"), Dylan placed his usual focus on capturing in-the-moment performances. And though his reputation for studio and onstage spontaneity is well-deserved, Blood on the Tracks also presents songs that he had spent almost all of 1974 writing and reworking. Personal, perhaps, the songs easily transcend their would-be biographies. If Dylan's attitudes towards his partners sometimes stand out as patronizing—\"You’re a Big Girl Now\" acting as an equally infantilizing bookend to 1966’s \"Just Like a Woman\"—they reveal more about the nature of hurt than anything useful about the songwriter.</p><p>One glimpse into the making of the album comes through the version that Dylan very nearly released, scrapping it at the last moment, after jackets and test pressings had already been made. Playing an advance copy at a family gathering in Minnesota in over the holidays, Dylan—at the behest of his brother—decided he wanted a brighter sound, less of a downer. Flexing his superstar muscle and anticipating Neil Young, Kanye West, and others, he had the album recalled, pulling together a band of local folkies in the days after Christmas 1974 to rerecord half of the songs. The New York acetate (most recently offered in 2015 for $12,000) is all late night atmospherics, mostly just Dylan and bassist Tony Brown, the sound of the former’s coat-buttons brushing against his guitar strings. Though tracks have come out via various box sets, bootlegs of the New York sessions—sourced warmly from the acetate—are every bit as magical as the final product, a classic all its own, minus a clunkier \"Lily, Rosemary, the Jack of Hearts.\"</p><p>In Minneapolis, Dylan brightened up the sound (changing keys on \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" striking a lighter keynote) and toned down some of the crueler lyrics (especially on \"If You See Her, Say Hello\"). If atmosphere was lost (and it was, especially without the pedal steel-drenched \"You’re A Big Girl Now\"), then accessibility was gained. Charting at #1 on its January 1975 release, Blood on the Tracks is arguably the last Dylan album on which a majority of the songs became standards of their own, part of the invisible canon shared at coffee houses, college campuses, or anywhere bright-eyed young pickers might congregate. In that way, it is also maybe Dylan’s last album of originals to qualify as \"folk music\" in both senses of the phrase: the popular genre defined by the presence of idioms and acoustic instruments, but also the great shared body of songs with lives and language that exist apart from their studio recordings and original performers. With the Byrds and many others achieving their own hits with his tunes and Dylan himself often circulating unrecorded work via folk music zines and songwriting demos, this had long been the expected fate of Dylan's songs.</p><p>Imagining Dylan as a simple songwriter, the template of Blood on the Tracks—sad boy with an acoustic guitar and a handful of chords—might seem basic, until one tries to replicate anything about it, or even just strum the songs at home. Blood on the Tracks lives alone in Dylan’s catalog, that open \"E\" tuning (which Dylan refused to explain to his musicians) often preventing the songs from sounding exactly right in the hands of others. It lives on in its own peculiar way. Dylan has seemed to keep \"Tangled Up In Blue\" in particular to himself, rewriting the song several times, both casually (playing fast and loose with the pronouns), and more formally, including a near-total rework released on 1984’s Real Live. One of the few older songs Dylan has performed consistently in recent years, even newer verses have emerged over the past half-decade. Nobody covers Dylan like Dylan either, apparently.</p><p>Though the albums on either side of Blood on the Tracks both made it to #1 and contained hints of the same songwriting territory, via Planet Waves’ \"Going, Going, Gone\" and Desire's \"Sara,\" especially, they were only just hints. Some of Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks persona remained visible via the two legs of the Rolling Thunder Revue, but the original open tuning never returned, and Dylan would soon bury his vulnerability, too. The surrealism would resurface in full force for 1978's Street-Legal, but the musical appeal didn’t. It took another few decades for Dylan even to return to the warm string-band sound of Blood on the Tracks, coming closest on his two 21st century albums of standards, Shadows in the Night and Fallen Angels. For a restless musician, it was a combination of factors that only came together once, locking together to transmit themselves through the years.</p><p>Even roughly 40 years later, Blood on the Tracks broadcasts hurt and longing so boldly it has become a stand-in, the type of shorthand a song licensor would deploy at the push of a button if it wasn’t so expensive and maybe too predictable. It manages a balance of old pain resolved and wounds so fresh they seem as if they might never heal, brutal personal assessment and doubt, unnecessary cruelties and real-time self-flagellation. While Blood on the Tracks can be a constant companion to listeners during periods of initial discovery, it (and Dylan’s whole catalog) has also become something to be lived with over a long period and put away for special occasions. Functioning like a literal album, the density of the passed time and pressed memories in \"Tangled Up in Blue\" grow richer with each passing year. As with the narratives of the songs themselves, Blood on the Tracks continues to absorb yesterday, today, and tomorrow, promising it can sustain new listeners as much as new meanings, should it ever have to be called back into service.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jesse Jarnow, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

It was not confined to the Oran of Camus. No. It turned up again in America, breeding in-a-compost of greed and uselessness and murder, in those places where statesmen and generals stash the bodies of the forever young. The plague ran in the blood of men in sharkskin suits, who ran for President promising life and delivering death. The infected young men machine-gunned babies in Asian ditches; they marshalled metal death through the mighty clouds, up above God's green earth, released it in silent streams, and moved on, while the hospitals exploded and green fields were churned to mud. <P>And here at home, something died. The bacillus moved among us, slaying that old America where the immigrants lit a million dreams in the shadows of the bridges, killing the great brawling country of barnstormers and wobblies and home-run hitters, the place of Betty Grable and Carl Furillo and heavyweight champions of the world. And through the fog of the plague, most art withered into journalism. Painters lift the easel to scrawl their innocence on walls and manifestos. Symphonies died on crowded roads. Novels served as furnished rooms for ideology. <P>And as the evidence piled up, as the rock was pushed back to reveal the worms, many retreated into that past that never was, the place of balcony dreams in Loew's Met, fair women and honorable men, where we browned ourselves in the Creamsicle summers, only faintly hearing the young men march to the troopships, while Jo Stafford gladly promised her fidelity. Poor America. Tossed on a pilgrim tide. Land where the poets died. <P>Except for Dylan. <P>He had remained, in front of us, or writing from the north country, and remained true. He was not the only one, of course; he is not the only one now. But of all the poets, Dylan is the one who has most clearly taken the rolled sea and put it in a glass. <P>Early on, he warned us, he gave many of us voice, he told us about the hard rain that was going to fall, and how it would carry plague. In the teargas in 1968 Chicago, they hurled Dylan at the walls of the great hotels, where the infected drew the blinds, and their butlers ordered up the bayonets. Most of them are gone now. Dylan remains. <P>So forget the clenched young scholars who analyze his rhymes into dust. Remember that he gave us voice, When our innocence died forever, Bob Dylan made that moment into art. The wonder is that he survived. <P>That is no small thing. We live in the smoky landscape now, as the exhausted troops seek the roads home. The signposts have been smashed; the maps are blurred. There is no politician anywhere who can move anyone to hope; the plague recedes, but it is not dead, and the statesmen are as irrelevant as the tarnished statues in the public parks. We live with a callous on the heart. Only the artists can remove it. Only the artists can help the poor land again to feel. <P>And here is Dylan, bringing feeling back home. In this album, he is as personal and as universal as Yeats or Blake; speaking for himself, risking that dangerous opening of the veins, he speaks for us all. The words, the music, the tones of voice speak of regret, melancholy, a sense of inevitable farewell, mixed with sly humor, some rage, and a sense of simple joy. They are the poems of a survivor. The warning voice of the innocent boy is no longer here, because Dylan has chosen not to remain a boy. It is not his voice that has grown richer, stronger, more certain; it is Dylan himself. And his poetry, his troubadour's traveling art, seems to me to be more meaningful than ever. I thought, listening to these songs, of the words of Yeats, walker of the roads of Ireland: \"We make out of the quarrel with others rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.\" <P>Dylan is now looking at the quarrel of the self. The crowds have moved back off the stage of history; we are left with the solitary human, a single hair on the skin of the earth. Dylan speaks now for that single hair. <P>If you see her, <BR>Say hello. <BR>She might be in Tangiers...* <P>So begins one of these poems, as light as a slide on ice, and as dangerous. Dylan doesn't fall in. Instead, he tells us the essentials; a woman once lived, gone off, vanished into the wild places of the earth, still loved. <P>If you're makin' love to her, <BR>Kiss her for the kid. <BR>Who always has respected her, <BR>for doin' what she did...* <P>It is a simple love song, of course, which is the proper territory of poets, but is about love filled with honor, and a kind of dignity, the generosity that so few people can summon when another has become a parenthesis in a life. That song, and some of the other love poems in this collection, seem to me absolutely right, in this moment at the end of wars, as all of us, old, young, middle-aged, men and women, are searching for some simple things to believe in. Dylan here tips his hat to Rimbaud and Verlaine, knowing all about the seasons in hell, but he insists on his right to speak of love, that human emotion that still exists, in Faulkner's phrase, in spite of, not because. <P>And yes, there is humor here too, a small grin pasted over the hurt, delivered almost casually, as if the poet could control the chaos of feeling with a few simply chosen words: <P>Life is sad <BR>Life is a bust. <BR>All ya can do. <BR>Is do what you must. <BR>You do what you must do, <BR>And ya do it will. <BR>I'll do it for you, <BR>Ah, honey baby, can't ya tell?** <P>A simple song. Not Dante's Inferno, and not intended to be. But a song which conjures up the American road, all the busted dreams of open places, boxcars, the Big Dipper pricking the velvet night. And it made me think of Ginsberg and Corso and Ferlinghetti, and most of all, Kerouac, racing Deam Mariarty across the country in the Fifties, embracing wind and night, passing Huck Finn on the riverbanks, bouncing against the Coast, and heading back again, with Kerouac dreaming his songs of the railroad earth. Music drove them; they always knew they were near New York when they picked up Symphony Sid on the radio. In San Francisco they declared a Renaissance and read poetry to jazz, trying to make Mallarme's dream flourish in the soil of America. They failed, as artist generally do, but in some ways Dylan has kept their promise. <P>Now he has moved past them, driving harder into self. Listen to \"Idiot Wind.\" It is a hard, cold-blooded poem about the survivor's anger, as personal as anything ever committed to a record. And yet is can also stand as the anthem for all who feel invaded, handled, bottled, packaged; all who spent themselves in combat with the plague; all who ever walked into the knives of humiliation or hatred. The idiot wind trivialized lives into gossip, celebrates fad and fashion, glorifies the dismal glitter of celebrity. Its products live on the covers of magazines, in all of television, if the poisoned air and dead grey lakes. But most of all, it blows through the human heart. Dylan knows that such a wind is the deadliest enemy of art. And when the artists die, we all die with them. <P>Or listen to the long narrative poem called \"Lily, Rosemary And The Jack of Hearts.\" It should not be reduced to notes, or taken out of context; it should be experienced in full. The compression of story is masterful, but its real wonder is in the spaces, in what the artist left out of his painting. To me, that has always been the key to Dylan's art. To state things plainly is the function of journalism; but Dylan sings a more fugitive song: allusive, symbolic, full of imagery and ellipses, and by leaving things out, he allows us the grand privilege of creating along with him. His song becomes our song because we live in those spaces. If we listen, if we work at it, we fill up the mystery, we expand and inhabit the work of art. It is the most democratic form of creation. <P>Totalitarian art tells us what to feel. Dylan's art feels, and invites us to join him. <P>That quality is in all the work in this collection, the long, major works, the casual drawings and etchings. There are some who attack Dylan because he will not rewrite \"Like a Rolling Stone\" or \"Gates of Eden.\" They are fools because they are cheating themselves of a shot at wonder. Every artist owns a vision of the world, and he shouts his protest when he sees evil mangling that vision. But he must also tell us the vision. Now we are getting Dylan's vision, rich and loamy, against which the world moved so darkly. To enter that envisioned world, is like plunging deep into a mountain pool, where the rocks are clear and smooth at the bottom. <P>So forget the Dylan whose image was eaten at by the mongers of the idiot wind. Don't mistake him for Isaiah, or a magazine cover, or a leader of guitar armies. He is only a troubadour, blood brother of Villon, a son of Provence, and he has survived the plague. Look: he has just walked into the courtyard, padding across the flagstones, strumming a guitar. The words are about \"flowers on the hillside bloomin' crazy/Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme...\" A girl, red-haired and melancholy, begins to smile. Listen: the poet sings to all of us: <P>But I'll see you in the sky above, <BR>In the tall grass, <BR>In the ones I love. <BR>You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.*** <BR>-- Pete Hamill, New York, 1974 <BR>&nbsp; <P>*from \"If You See Her, Say Hello,\" ©1974 Ram's Horn Music.

And while Bob Dylan directly addresses his crumbling relationship with his wife, Sara, on the final track, Desire is hardly as personal as its predecessor, finding Dylan returning to topical songwriting and folk tales for the core of the record. It's all over the map, as far as songwriting goes, and so is it musically, capturing Dylan at the beginning of the Rolling Thunder Revue era, which was more notable for its chaos than its music. And, so it's only fitting that Desire fits that description as well, as it careens between surging folk-rock, Mideastern dirges, skipping pop, and epic narratives. It's little surprise that Desire doesn't quite gel, yet it retains its own character -- really, there's no other place where Dylan tried as many different styles, as many weird detours, as he does here. And, there's something to be said for its rambling, sprawling character, which has a charm of its own. Even so, the record would have been assisted by a more consistent set of songs; there are some masterpieces here, though: \"Hurricane\" is the best-known, but the effervescent \"Mozambique\" is Dylan at his breeziest, \"Sara\" at his most nakedly emotional, and \"Isis\" is one of his very best songs of the '70s, a hypnotic, contemporized spin on a classic fable. This may not add up to a masterpiece, but it does result in one of his most fascinating records of the '70s and '80s -- more intriguing, lyrically and musically, than most of his latter-day affairs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

It's all over the map, as far as songwriting goes, and so is it musically, capturing Dylan at the beginning of the Rolling Thunder Revue era, which was more notable for its chaos than its music. And, so it's only fitting that Desire fits that description as well, as it careens between surging folk-rock, Mideastern dirges, skipping pop, and epic narratives. It's little surprise that Desire doesn't quite gel, yet it retains its own character -- really, there's no other place where Dylan tried as many different styles, as many weird detours, as he does here. And, there's something to be said for its rambling, sprawling character, which has a charm of its own. Even so, the record would have been assisted by a more consistent set of songs; there are some masterpieces here, though: \"Hurricane\" is the best-known, but the effervescent \"Mozambique\" is Dylan at his breeziest, \"Sara\" at his most nakedly emotional, and \"Isis\" is one of his very best songs of the '70s, a hypnotic, contemporized spin on a classic fable. This may not add up to a masterpiece, but it does result in one of his most fascinating records of the '70s and '80s -- more intriguing, lyrically and musically, than most of his latter-day affairs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The biggest criticism of The Bootleg Series, Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975 -- the third installment in Columbia/Legacy's excavation of the exhaustive Bob Dylan vaults (the first was a box set, containing three volumes) -- is that it's a compilation of highlights from his Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975, one that doesn't set out to replicate a set list but instead offers two discs and 22 tracks from this fabled tour. Apart from that, there's very little to complain about on this superlative set, which offers the first official release of Rolling Thunder material. Yes, this had been heavily bootlegged over the decades, plus it was documented on Dylan's notoriously unwatchable film Renaldo & Clara and there was Hard Rain, a collection culled from the post-Thunder 1976 tour that was similar but sour and nowhere near as good the 1975 material, as this superb set illustrates. Hearing this is a revelation, even for serious Dylan watchers -- those so serious to own several bootlegs, even a full shelf of Dylan, but not as obsessive as those who track Bob's every move -- and those who aren't as dedicated, yet still harbor a serious interest, will find this equally absorbing, since this is simply tremendous. It has become legend that Dylan will change arrangements and switch lyrics at the drop of a hat, which was evident on his jaunt with the Band in 1974, preserved for posterity on Before the Flood. Even so, he's looser, wilder, and more alive in this careening, thrilling album, a record where \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" gallops along as if it were \"Leopard Skin Pill-Box Hat.\" As that suggests, the wildest thing about this is the electric cuts, where an unwieldy band turns out an overpowering sound that sounds inevitable, as if it's the only way these songs could be played, even when you've heard these songs countless times before in other arrangements. The acoustic moments don't pack the same charge, nor do they contain many of his duets with Joan Baez, yet they're intimate, passionate versions of the songs. In fact, there's not a bad moment here, and if it doesn't replicate the Rolling Thunder tour list to the letter, it does indeed capture the essence of this legendary stint, which is why it's necessary for every serious fan.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Arriving after the twin peaks of Blood on the Tracks and Desire, Street Legal seemed like a disappointment upon its 1978 release, and it still seems a little subpar years after its release. Perhaps that's because Bob Dylan was uncertain himself, not just writing a set of songs with no connecting themes, but replacing the sprawl of the Rolling Thunder Revue with a slick, professional big band, featuring a horn section and several backing vocalists. The interesting thing about this is that the music and slick production don't jibe with the songs, which are as dense as anything Dylan had written since before his motorcycle accident. So, Street Legal becomes an interesting dichotomy, filled with songs that deserve close attention but recorded in arrangements that discourage such listening. As such, Street Legal is fascinating just for that reason -- in another setting, these are songs that would have been hailed as near-masterpieces, but covered in gloss, they seem strange. Consequentially, it's not surprising that there are factions of Dylanphiles that find this worth the time, while just as many consider it a missed opportunity.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Dylan himself may be part of that audience, since he did back away from such a staunchly dogged viewpoint not long afterward, but that doesn't change Saved's status as being a fairly flat -- and, for Dylan, fairly pedestrian -- testament to his faith. And, if Slow Train Coming found him at a fairly creative peak of songwriting and supported by a supple backing band, he's turning out routine songs here, and the backing follows suit, resulting in his flattest record yet.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Bob Dylan converted to Christianity in 1979. Like many who have been born again, Dylan spoke and sang solely of his faith for a brief period -- roughly half a year, beginning in November of 1979 and ending in May of 1980. Facing a fan base who were generally furious at his newfound religion, Dylan started to thread some oldies into his set lists but he didn't leave gospel behind until he released Infidels in 1983.</p><p>Once he returned to secular music, he didn't abandon all the songs that he wrote during this period -- and it's also unclear what became of his faith, as he stopped speaking of it in concrete terms in public -- yet these three years remained one of Dylan's least understood phases, possibly because the studio albums he released between 1979 and 1981 were cocooned in studio gloss. Trouble No More, the 13th instalment of The Bootleg Series, attempts to right the record by collecting a wealth of live material from this period, supplementing these cuts with unreleased studio tracks, including a few songs that have never seen the light of day.<p>Whether it's appreciated in its lavish eight-CD/single-DVD box set or its judiciously edited double-disc companion, Trouble No More performs the same function: it illuminates the passion driving this music. Unlike Another Self Portrait, this Bootleg Series installment offers a different perspective of a maligned phase, but it doesn't provide a jolting revelation, not even with several unveiled Dylan originals in tow. A few of these songs would've enhanced either Saved or Shot of Love -- in particular, \"Ain't Gonna Go to Hell for Anybody\" feels robust as it dodges confession -- but the execution matters more than the content. Dylan did write a handful of classics during this time but the tunes tend to be overshadowed by the ragged, soulful performances, where the songs -- both major and minor -- get reshaped on-stage and in the studio. The band impresses -- this music, which sounded so slick on the released records, has grit, swing and soul -- but they're only following their leader, who is chasing a muse that may still remain elusive to his audience.</p><p>Dylan may not articulate his conversion in words -- these are among his stiffest lyrics, allowing no room for ambiguity yet still bearing some playfulness -- but Trouble No More, more than Saved or even the fine Slow Train Coming, is buoyed by the music. Whether he's singing a slight song, easing into testimony, or leaning into a blues, Dylan seems engaged, even on the verge of rapture, an excitement that carries through the full live shows from 1980 and 1981 on the Deluxe Edition, where he reworks his old tunes -- \"Maggie's Farm\" is driven by a wild, twisting riff -- in hopes that they open the door to his new thing. Few appreciated his trip at the time, but years later it feels compelling, possibly because it's allowed to be messy and soulful within the parameters of The Bootleg Series.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>In the autumn of 1978, Bob Dylan began performing a new version of \"Tangled Up in Blue.\" In addition to a complete melodic makeover, he updated a lyric that had previously referenced an unnamed Italian poet to address a more specific source text: \"She opened up the Bible and started quoting it to me/Jeremiah, Chapter 13, verses 21 and 33.\" Debuted during the tour behind his directionless Street Legal LP, his new arrangement of the beloved track offered a glimpse at Dylan's next reinvention: You can hear a white light starting to seep in.</p><p>Right around that time, Dylan introduced a new song to his band called \"Slow Train Coming.\" That track appears in four vastly different versions on Trouble No More, the fascinating new Bootleg Series release covering his fruitful but polarizing era as an evangelical Christian songwriter between 1979 and 1981. The earliest rendition on the collection stems from his '78 tour rehearsals when the verses were not yet finalized and Dylan mostly just hammered in the chorus: \"There's a slow/Slow train coming/Around the bend,\" he sings over and over again as his backing vocalists' performance grows increasingly dramatic with each repetition. It's a stirring, uncanny document of an artist discovering his new sound&mdash;an ominous take on gospel to which he'd devote himself for the next three years.</p><p>\"Slow Train Coming\" would become the title track to the first entry in Dylan's \"Christian trilogy.\" These albums, which draw on the grainy, burnt-out blues sound he'd adopt more fully in the 21st century, remain the most mysterious items in one of rock music's deepest, most daunting discographies. On principle alone, they turned off multitudes of fans who once admired Dylan's staunch individualism and leftist politics. But for Dylan, they signified a rebirth, both creatively and personally. By the end of the decade, his longevity as a rock icon was unprecedented: Elvis was gone; The Beatles had been broken up as long they'd been around; the \"new Dylans\" like Springsteen were now welcoming their own disciples. When the \"old Dylan\"&mdash;just pushing 40&mdash;found himself uninspired on what had become known as his \"Las Vegas Tour,\" the Bible offered a way forward, even if it didn't provide the answers he might have wanted.</p><p>For the most part, the songs on Trouble No More do not reflect the hope or contentment usually associated with praise music. They are as venomous and full of doom as Dylan's more celebrated writing on war, politics, or love. Neither as warm and embracing as Cat Stevens' nor as spiritually wise as Leonard Cohen's, Dylan's religious work seems to come from a place of fear&mdash;borderline paranoia. Inspired by the best-selling Hal Lindsey book The Late Great Planet Earth, he constantly pairs his acceptance of Jesus with warnings of an imminent apocalypse. In a catchy song called \"Precious Angel,\" propelled by a bouncy, pinched Mark Knopfler guitar riff, he looks to the future and sings of \"darkness that will fall from on high/When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die.\" In many songs, Dylan quotes directly from the Bible. In others, he sings as first-person \"I,\" instructing \"you\" to follow his lead and make a change or risk facing unthinkable consequences: a strange play on the messianic presence he'd assumed in the lives of his fans. \"I told you the answer was blowing in the wind, and it was,\" he allegedly announced at a show, \"I told you the times they were a-changing, and they did. And I'm telling you Christ is coming back&mdash;and he is!\"</p><p>To perform this material live, Dylan pressed reset on his songbook, ignoring the nearly two decades of work that preceded Slow Train Coming. He was debuting new music at every concert&mdash;songs that would eventually appear on the sharply focused Saved in 1980 and the more eclectic Shot of Love the following year. In the absence of his hits, he fleshed out setlists with faithful covers of devotional songs like Dallas Holm's \"Rise Again\" and hymns performed by a four-person gospel choir who toured with him. Fans were perplexed. Throughout a stunning San Francisco performance of \"Pressing On,\" one of his finest gospel songs, the audience remains silent. They refuse to clap along during the a capella break, inadvertently bringing the hard-won battle in its lyrics to life. There's a captivating tension in hearing an artist so revered, so evangelized, preach to empty seats&mdash;an energy that pervades the set and makes this one of Dylan's most haunting and vulnerable collections of music.</p><p>Trouble No More exists in several editions. The most comprehensive set includes two live shows from the era; two discs of tour highlights; two discs of outtakes and rarities; and a bizarre concert film interrupted by newly filmed scenes of actor Michael Shannon reciting sermons in a vacant church (likely in the absence of Dylan's own between-song sermons, which have mysteriously and perhaps mercifully been edited out). These recordings beat out their studio counterparts at nearly every turn. Stemming largely from live shows and rehearsals, they avoid the tinny production and glossy pastiche of the records, highlighting this era's latent strengths: the unnerving conviction in Dylan's vocals, his killer backing band, and, most of all, the underlying strength of the material.</p><p>Songs that previously felt like hidden gems in Dylan's catalog become centerpieces. A live rendition of \"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\" features bombastic, blazing guitar solos from guest performer Carlos Santana as Dylan spits his way through the lyrics, making its surreal narrative even more impassioned. \"When He Returns,\" the closing track on Slow Train Coming, appears in stark, definitive form, on solo piano and organ at a 1980 show in Toronto. Dylan's voice sounds beautiful, fanatical, and somewhat insane, which is exactly how this material should be delivered.</p><p>Unlike other editions of the Bootleg Series exploring Dylan's mythically productive studio sessions, the outtakes are not the main draw here. The slow, stately \"Making a Liar Out of Me\" comes closest to a lost classic, though the band's performance is too tentative for it to truly transcend. Less ambitious tracks like \"Ain't Gonna Go to Hell for Anybody\" and \"Ain't No Man Righteous, No Not One\" are pleasant but steer close to \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" levels of singalong didacticism. While Dylan was writing prolifically at this time, his relentless output felt more like a search for the right words as opposed to an overflow of inspiration. For the most part, the best songs all ended up on the albums. What's more interesting is how the material evolved from its early forms to the studio renditions and onto the stage. With key tracks appearing in multiple incarnations, the set examines how Dylan reapproached this material the longer he lived with it: how \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" ascended from a bitter confession to a twisted roll call, or how the livestock in \"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\" slowly disassembled over the course of the tour.</p><p>By 1981, Dylan eased up on his evangelism. He introduced decidedly secular new material to his shows&mdash;like the excellent \"Caribbean Wind\" and the not-so-excellent \"Lenny Bruce\"&mdash;and welcomed back old favorites like \"Maggie's Farm\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" Soon, he would disown this entire era. He abandoned its material in later setlists and denied he'd ever even been a Christian, citing it as just another example of the media's unfair insistence on labeling him at every turn. \"I mean, nobody cares what Billy Joel's religious views are,\" he spat at one interviewer, who could have responded by pointing out that Billy Joel never wrote a song called \"Property of Jesus.\" Regardless of his true beliefs, Trouble No More offers living proof of Dylan's commitment at the time. Across these 102 tracks, he sounds as devoted to his work as ever, puncturing a style of music built to offer definitive answers with his own heavy brand of cosmic nihilism.</p><p>The era came to a close with \"Every Grain of Sand,\" the final track on Shot of Love. Allegedly written fully-formed at the piano in the summer of 1980, it remains one of his most powerful compositions: If the sole purpose of his religious search was to lead him here, then the journey was worth it. The track appears twice on Trouble No More, as an intimate rehearsal midway through the tour and a full-band performance on its very last night, before he took a three-year break from live shows and mostly abandoned religious music (at least until his 2009 curio Christmas in the Heart). Between those two takes, Dylan's voice lowered and the song's pace slowed, trading its epiphanic intensity for a comforting sense of foresight and calm. Together, they summarize the story told throughout Trouble No More: one man's path from fear to acceptance, obsession to understanding, getting born and pressing on.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Sam Sodomsky</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Oh Mercy was hailed as a comeback, not just because it had songs noticeably more meaningful than anything Bob Dylan had recently released, but because Daniel Lanois' production gave it cohesion. There was cohesion on <i>Empire Burlesque</i>, of course, but that cohesion was a little too slick, a little too commercial, whereas this record was filled with atmospheric, hazy production -- a sound as arty as most assumed the songs to be. And Dylan followed suit, giving Lanois significant songs -- palpably social works, love songs, and poems -- that seemed to connect with his past. And, at the time, this production made it seem like the equivalent of his '60s records, meaning that its artiness was cutting edge, not portentous. Over the years, <i>Oh Mercy</i> hasn't aged particularly well, seeming as self-conscious as such other gauzy Lanois productions as <i>So</i> and <i>The Joshua Tree</i>, even though it makes more sense than the ersatz pizzazz of Burlesque. Still, the songs make Oh Mercy noteworthy; they find Dylan quietly raging against the materialism of President Reagan and accepting maturity, albeit with a slight reluctance. So, <i>Oh Mercy</i> is finally more interesting for what it tries to achieve than for what it actually does achieve. At its best, this is a collection of small, shining moments, with the best songs shining brighter than their production or the album's overall effect.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

And, even after its 1991 release, it retains the feeling of being a special, shared secret among the hardcore, since -- no matter the acclaim -- it's the kind of record that only the hardcore will seek out. Of course, the great irony is that even casual Dylan fans will find much to treasure in this three-disc set of unreleased material. They'll find songs as good as anything that made the records (sometimes surpassing the official releases, especially on the last disc), plus alternate versions (including original versions of songs on Blood on the Tracks) and long-fabled songs, from the incomplete \"She's Your Lover Now\" to songs cut from The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. This doesn't just function as an alternate history of Dylan, but as an expansion of Dylan's history, enriching what is already known about the greatest songwriter of his era -- after all, every song here would qualify as the best song on anybody else's album. And that's no exaggeration.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Given the acclaim of The Bootleg Series and the perceived disappointment of Under the Red Sky, it seemed like it was time for Dylan to bounce back with a convincing album of original material. Instead, he delivered a record of folk songs, his first straight covers album ever, not to mention his first guitar, harmonica, and voice record since the early '60s. That alone would make it an anomaly, but Good as I Been to You is more than that, because it's a really good traditional folk album, having just enough familiar tunes -- \"Frankie & Albert,\" \"Blackjack Davey,\" \"Sittin' on Top of the World,\" \"Froggie Went a Courtin'\" -- to provide an entryway to the less familiar numbers, which are delivered equally well. Yes, this could be seen as a rather unassuming record, but that's what's special about it. In 1992, not even folksingers were working with this material, but Dylan did, reviving folk's (and rock's) ties to the past at an unexpected time and with unexpectedly strong results.

		"review": "<p>After spending much of the '90s touring and simply not writing songs, Bob Dylan returned in 1997 with Time Out of Mind, his first collection of new material in seven years. Where Under the Red Sky, his last collection of original compositions, had a casual, tossed-off feel, Time Out of Mind is carefully considered, from the densely detailed songs to the dark, atmospheric production. Sonically, the album is reminiscent of Oh Mercy, the last album Dylan recorded with producer Daniel Lanois, but Time Out of Mind has a grittier foundation -- by and large, the songs are bitter and resigned, and Dylan gives them appropriately anguished performances. Lanois bathes them in hazy, ominous sounds, which may suit the spirit of the lyrics, but are often in opposition to Dylan's performances. Consequently, the album loses a little of its emotional impact, yet the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years. It's a better, more affecting record than Oh Mercy, not only because the songs have a stronger emotional pull, but because Lanois hasn't sanded away all the grit. As a result, the songs retain their power, leaving Time Out of Mind as one of the rare latter-day Dylan albums that meets his high standards.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Not long after attending the California funeral of his friend Jerry Garcia, Bob Dylan found himself snowbound at his Minnesota farm. He would listen to the storms and write after the sun sank from the winter sky. Those songs turned the cold environment into a crystalline lens on the tiring world—a place that was \"not dark yet, but getting there,\" where \"the blues [were] wrapped around my head.\"</p><p>What Dylan had left to say or whether he had any enthusiasm left for saying it had, for a while, been unclear. Seven years had passed since he had released an original new tune, and that album, Under the Red Sky, was a near-catastrophe, scuttling what had seemed a comeback after Dylan crept through his polarizing '80s evangelism. He had grown disillusioned with the cycle of writing and recording, he later said, and simply wanted to play.</p><p>During the '90s, he issued two solo acoustic albums of earnest, sometimes poignant renditions of American standards, delighting those who had pined for the lost days of the folk kid from Greenwich Village. But coffeehouse covers hadn't made Dylan a spark of resistance in the '60s or a source of bittersweet reckonings with reality in the '70s. He had become a legacy act, accruing lifetime achievement laurels and touring his hits for Boomers in khakis. Possibly for the first time in his career, Dylan was beginning to blend into the scenery.</p><p>But months after Garcia's funeral, Dylan approached the audacious producer Daniel Lanois. Since helming the contentious sessions for what many had prematurely considered Dylan's actual comeback, 1989's half-stepping Oh Mercy, Lanois had cut U2's Achtung Baby and Emmylou Harris' Wrecking Ball, a wondrously atmospheric abstraction of the singer's gorgeous and aging country vision. In a New York hotel room, Dylan read Lanois the lyrics and asked him if he had a record. \"I said, ‘Yes, Bob, I think we've got a record,\"' Lanois remembered with a sly laugh during a recent phone call.</p><p>Dylan sent Lanois home with a list of reference records to study—Charley Patton, Little Walter, Little Willie John, a mix of ragged blues and primordial rock. \"I listened to these records, and I understood,\" Lanois wrote in his memoir, Soul Mining. \"A new birth with the old dogs under your arm, like a stack of classic books.\" In the end, that rebirth was Time Out of Mind, Dylan's 30th album and one that doesn't sound much like the basic blues at all. Instead, it is an essential post-modern reappraisal of them, an experimental consideration of what could become of the blues' sound and spirit and a mutual communion of articulate, exquisite despair. At the last minute, Lanois took Dylan's blurry snapshot for the cover of Time Out of Mind; on tape, that's exactly how he had captured him.</p><p>The next year was a reminder of what Dylan said he despised about making records—extended seaside sessions on the Atlantic and the Pacific, guitars smashed in anger, a militia of Nashville crackerjacks and world-class session players who had to be told more than once to play a lot less. Lanois and Dylan fought like hell in the parking lot of the Miami studio where they recorded, but after more than half a year and many mixes, overdubs, and lyrical revisions, Time Out of Mind—11 songs that would transform Dylan from seemingly obsolete icon to wise, wizened visionary almost overnight—was finished. And then Dylan nearly died.</p><p>Four months before Time Out of Mind arrived and just days after his 56th birthday, Dylan was admitted into a Los Angeles hospital after persistent chest pains that suggested a heart attack. Instead, acute pulmonary histoplasmosis—a nasty fungal infection caused by bird-and-bat feces in the country's most fertile river valleys—had inflamed the covering around his heart and nearly killed him. \"I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon,\" he said later. For weeks between his hospital release and the album's release, Dylan was bedridden, emerging just in time to play for the pope in Rome and sit for a series of high-profile interviews that inquired not only about his near-death experience but also that of his career.</p><p>Dylan's brush with Elvis made for an easy press hook, especially given the twilit misery of Time Out of Mind. In its four-star review, Rolling Stone noted the album \"confront[-ed] his advancing years and the prospects of failing health.\" In a moment of too-soon chicanery, Newsweek's cover joked \"Dylan Lives.\"</p><p>But Time Out of Mind is not merely about death, though its inevitability looms at the periphery of these songs with the certainty of the setting sun; sometimes, death even seems for Dylan like the easy, desirous exit. Instead, Time Out of Mind is about dealing with life and its itinerant lows, knowing how it will all end, anyway. The blues become an emotional state of being. Through the cobwebs of his beleaguered voice, Dylan musters all the feelings of losing love, full of pride and insanity and lust and violence and humor, implicitly navigating the five stages of grief.</p><p>He writes with the hardened edge of Hemingway, trying to cloak feelings with callouses and sweetening his bitterness with a dash of wit. A portrait of the sometimes-awful truth about life and love, Time Out of Mind stands alongside Mark Rothko's so-called Black Paintings, conceived in poor health just before he killed himself, for its ability to stand at the lip of an abyss and stare into it. If you look long enough at the Rothko or listen closely to the Dylan, the most unexpected shapes will eventually stumble out of the dark.</p><p>Dylan begins in a bout of denial. At the start of \"Love Sick,\" he shuffles through empty streets in the rain, a tangle of warped guitar, haunted organs, and faint drums aptly framing his bleak mood. He is mad at the world, judging its smiling people and castigating its illusion of happiness. \"I'm sick of love/I wish I'd never met you,\" he calmly seethes in the closing chorus, addressing his ire not at anyone in particular but at the idea of human connection at large. \"I'm sick of love/I'm trying to forget you.\"</p><p>But the first five minutes of \"Love Sick,\" which sound so preternaturally cool and ultimately unaffected that the song was immortalized in a Victoria's Secret advertisement, are purely a pose. After Dylan sashays through that last refrain, he collapses into the confession that sets the tone for most of Time Out of Mind: \"Just don't know what to do/I'd give anything to be with you,\" he sings, his voice now curdled. The band pulls back from the pulse and lets the melody dangle against the open air, as if they too are surprised by the sudden candor of their maestro. This is the moment where we get to the heart of Time Out of Mind, where Dylan crawls inside his own depression.</p><p>For most of the next 70 minutes, that's where he stays: Dylan's misery is so exhaustive that, during \"Dirt Road Blues,\" he turns the sight of a rainbow into an instance of pain. Elsewhere, parties give him headaches. He is alternately cold and broke, hot and aimless. \"It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,\" he half-howls during \"Cold Irons Bound,\" an aired litany of grievances that finds him losing most everything he holds sacred. \"It's sadder still to feel your heart turn away.\"</p><p>Dylan hits rock-bottom during a duo of creeping existential crises, mercifully separated here by a swaggering barroom prowl. During \"Not Dark Yet,\" he tells us he has been to \"London… and ‘gay Paree,\"' reminders that he is a worldly sort who has had success and lived well. But here he is, shattered by the most pedestrian of things—love, or the loss of it—and tragically concluding \"There's not even room enough to be anywhere.\" A decade before, he was coming down from his great Christian awakening. Now, he doesn't \"even hear the murmur of a prayer.\" How could he fall further?</p><p>Lanois' production has often been criticized for warping Dylan's voice too much, for burying it in a cloud of effects. In early Time Out of Mind demos and outtakes, after all, Dylan practically sounds like Etta James, riding on top of his blues; on the record itself, he is pushing the words upward as an act of mere survival, letting them out so he can breathe back in. But the pervading murk of \"Not Dark Yet\" is exactly what these lyrics demand. As with the transmuted blues of Loren Connors or Grouper, Lanois lets Dylan flicker at the threshold of existence here, giving his troubles a sense of mortal urgency.</p><p>\"Trying to Get to Heaven\" is about being uncomfortable with everything and everyone everywhere—kicked out of Missouri, given false consolation in New Orleans, taken for a ride to nowhere in Baltimore. In the end, he simply falls asleep to escape inside his dreams, a world that now seems as concrete and meaningful as the actual people around him.</p><p>Strange as it may sound, \"Trying to Get to Heaven\" has long felt inspirational, given the subsequent arc of Dylan's career. \"When you think that you've lost everything/You find out you can always lose a little more,\" he half-grunts toward the end, reaching the apogee of his sadness. But Time Out of Mind won three Grammys and kick-started Dylan's true second coming—a string of self-produced, hyper-stylized albums that turned his love of the blues, standards, and literature into impressionistic, intricate Americana and helped him on his way to a Pulitzer. In your grimmest moments, just remember how near-death Dylan sounds here—and exactly how much life he actually had left.</p><p>Even deep in his own hurt, Dylan maintains a sense of pride, hoping to preserve some dignity as he approaches his end. Amid the sad, stately waltz of \"Standing in the Doorway,\" he tells his best lie: \"I would be crazy if I took you back,\" he sings, the slide guitars curling beneath him like confused question marks. \"It would go up against every rule.\" This is what he is supposed to say, of course, to save face when the entire album is about how not getting her back will be his ruin. Who hasn't been here before—completely despondent, but trying to pretend you've got the upper hand in some romantic standoff?</p><p>This is the softer, more playful side of Dylan's anger, but it occasionally flashes into hints of violence. When he croons \"Don't know if I saw you, if I'd kiss you or kill you\" early in the album, it feels like a lonely abstraction, a what-if penned from a distance. By record's end, though, it has morphed into real menace. Breathing fast, pulse racing, he's doing his best to hold himself together during \"Can't Wait,\" trying not to lash out or do something he will live to regret. The guitars slash, and the organs roar, fighting the same urge to explode. \"If I ever saw you comin', I don't know what I might do,\" he yells as best he can. \"I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.\" His sadness, at last, has beaten his civility.</p><p>In spite of its presiding gloom, Time Out of Mind actually delivered a new Dylan standard—his first hit in decades and a song that has become almost as ubiquitous as \"Like a Rolling Stone\" or \"Forever Young,\" even if he mostly hasn't been the one to sing it. A month before Time Out of Mind arrived, Billy Joel turned the spare ballad \"Make You Feel My Love\" into a bombastic, string-swept single, shouting the lyrics and howling behind the harmonica like it was he who stepped onstage at Newport in 1965. Twin versions by Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood soundtracked the 1998 rom-com Hope Floats, while takes from Neil Diamond, Ed Sheeran, and Kelly Clarkson have followed. But it was Adele's piano-and-cello lament—and its subsequent appearance on \"Britain's Got Talent\"—that turned Dylan's ostensible love song into an international standard and, according to Adele, made Dylan at least a million pounds in a year.</p><p>But what is there on Time Out of Mind to suggest that Dylan had suddenly turned soft for three minutes, that he would dip so smoothly into guileless piano ballads? Absolutely nothing. In the preceding song, he's so tormented his crops are dying and all his friends are traitors; in the next song, he wonders again if he could control his violent impulses if he encountered his paramour. This isn't the sort of person who shuffles over to the piano and readily forgives. This is the sort of person your friends warn you about, the guy who shows up drunk at 3 a.m. and slurs drunken promises as he bullies the doorbell.</p><p>All the song's romantic images about warm embraces and dried tears and self-sacrifice are purely hypothetical, things he \"could\" do if the subject would simply submit to his advances already. In the five stages of grief, this is bargaining, and it's a particularly nasty business here. \"I know you haven't made your mind up yet, but I would never do you wrong,\" he pleads, the trace of guilt in his voice vanishing as quickly as it appeared. He makes his demand clear. \"I've known it from the moment that we met/No doubt in my mind where you belong.\" In context, \"Make You Feel My Love\" is not a romantic bauble; it is an ironclad threat in a velvet glove, one final attempt to force love from the listener at any cost.</p><p>The Dylan faithful largely hated \"Make You Feel My Love\" from the start. Ian Bell—the late British journalist and exhaustive Dylan analyst—quipped that the song \"should have been shipped off instantly, gratis, to Billy Joel, Garth Brooks, and the rest of the balladeers who would take the vapid things to their sentimental hearts.\" It is a song worth reconsidering, though, not in Joel's mawkish translation or even Adele's austere one but instead in its original setting. Those famous covers alternately sound triumphant or plaintive, suitable enough for a standalone single.</p><p>But even as Dylan plays tender piano above a pillow-top organ, he sounds absolutely broken, the cracks of his voice widening into chasms. There's occasionally a whisper of percussion and a distant acoustic guitar lick, but he's mostly left to wrestle these feelings himself. This is the real pit of his desperation, concealed to read like romance in order to save face. It is an essential piece of this picture, a last-ditch attempt for sanity from someone who has lost control.</p><p>In the end, Dylan pulls himself together, at least enough to survive for a while longer. Time Out of Mind ends with \"Highlands,\" a brilliant and occasionally hilarious 17-minute shuffle that frames life's endless numbered days as a string of largely meaningless moments. \"Feel like I'm driftin', driftin' from scene to scene,\" Dylan mumbles in a monotone fit for someone who has simply resigned himself to exist. \"I'm wonderin' what in the devil could it all possibly mean.\" He listens to Neil Young, avoids a sad dog, ponders his wardrobe, envies young people, and details an awkward encounter with a waitress in a Boston café that paints him as an artist perennially uncomfortable with his audience. All the while, he daydreams of the Scottish Highlands and its verdant scenery—for him, heaven, or \"where I'll be when I get called home.\" He understands his age and fate, even if he longs for youth. Without the ballast of his love, this moribund acceptance becomes his life.</p><p>The total craft of Time Out of Mind, the dry spell that preceded it, and the saga that produced it collectively serve a cautionary function. If you hadn't given up on Dylan by 1997, you were either a zealot who would eke merit from most anything he made or a casual fan who had stopped paying enough attention to have a strong opinion. But the sophistication and nuance of Time Out of Mind work only because Dylan had become a wunderkind, gone electric, faced backlash, crashed his motorcycle, wrecked his marriages, found his faith, faltered in it, fathered a family, seen his kid become a rock star, lost old friends, wavered in relevance, and wondered if he cared about any of it anymore at all. The extra grain in his voice, the lessons of his words, the disorienting blur of his band: It is the sublimated sound of actual pain, lived and analyzed and announced in songs that show you exactly how dark the world can get.</p><p>Time Out of Mind feels like the antithesis of our pervasive need to have an opinion about everything all the time. It is a reflection on a life lived, not a reaction to someone else's ideas. There's a place for both, as Dylan's own brash, youthful songs made clear a half-century ago. The difference is one of insight, of 55 years of life slowly distilled into wisdom. Everything won't be alright, but desolation can be its own unlikely source of triumph. Dylan had a grief that gave him nowhere to go but the grave—or, as he did, onward.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Grayson Haver Currin</strong></p>"

There are none of the foreboding, apocalyptic warnings that permeated Time Out of Mind and even underpinned \"Things Have Changed,\" his Oscar-winning theme to Curtis Hanson's 2000 film Wonder Boys. Just as important, Daniel Lanois' deliberately arty, diffuse production has retreated into the mist, replaced by an uncluttered, resonant production that gives Dylan and his ace backing band room to breathe. And they run wild with that liberty, rocking the house with the grinding \"Lonesome Day Blues\" and burning it down with the fabulously swinging \"Summer Days.\" They're equally captivating on the slower songs, whether it's the breezily romantic \"Bye and Bye,\" the torch song \"Moonlight,\" or the epic reflective closer, \"Sugar Baby.\" Musically, Dylan hasn't been this natural or vital since he was with the Band, and even then, those records were never as relaxed and easy or even as hard-rocking as these. That alone would make Love and Theft a remarkable achievement, but they're supported by a tremendous set of songs that fully synthesize all the strands in his music, from the folksinger of the early '60s, through the absurdist storyteller of the mid-'60s, through the traditionalist of the early '70s, to the grizzled professional of the '90s. None of this is conscious, it's all natural. There's an ease to his writing and a swagger to his performance unheard in years -- he's cracking jokes and murmuring wry asides, telling stories, crooning, and swinging. It's reminiscent of his classic records, but he's never made a record that's been such sheer, giddy fun as this, and it stands proudly among his very best albums.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>When Bob Dylan dropped Time Out of Mind in 1997, it was a rollicking rockabilly and blues record, full of sad songs about mortality, disappointment, and dissolution. 2001 brought Love and Theft, which was also steeped in stomping blues and other folk forms. It was funny, celebratory in places and biting in others. Dylan has been busy since then: he did a Victoria's Secret commercial, toured almost nonstop, was in a couple films -- Larry Charles' Masked and Anonymous and Martin Scorsese's documentary No Direction Home -- and published the first of a purported three volumes of his cagey, rambling autobiography, Chronicles. Lately, he's been thinking about Alicia Keys. This last comment comes from the man himself in \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" the opening track on Modern Times, a barn-burning, raucous, and unruly blues tune that finds the old man sounding mighty feisty and gleefully agitated: \"I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys/Couldn't keep from cryin'/She was born in Hell's Kitchen and I was livin' down the line/I've been lookin' for her even clear through Tennessee.\" The drums shuffle with brushes, the piano is pumping like Jerry Lee Lewis, the bass is popping, and a slide guitar that feels like it's calling the late Michael Bloomfield back from 1966 -- à la Highway 61 Revisited -- slips in and out of the ether like a ghost wanting to emerge in the flesh. Dylan's own choppy leads snarl in the break and he's letting his blues fall down like rain: \"Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches/I'll recruit my army from the orphanages/ I've been to St. Herman's church and said my religious vows/I sucked the milk out of a thousand cows/I got the pork chop, she got the pie/She ain't no angel and neither am I...I did all I could/I did it right there and then/I've already confessed I don't need to confess again.\"</p><p>Thus begins the third part of Dylan's renaissance trilogy (thus far, y'all). Modern Times is raw; it feels live, immediate, and in places even shambolic. Rhythms slip, time stretches and turns back on itself, and lyrics are rushed to fit into verses that just won't stop coming. Dylan produced the set himself under his Jack Frost moniker. Its songs are humorous and cryptic, tender and snarling. What's he saying? We don't need to concern ourselves with that any more than we had to Willie Dixon talking about backdoor men or Elmore James dusting his broom. Dylan's blues are primitive and impure. Though performed by a crackerjack band, they're played with fury; the singer wrestles down musical history as he spits in the eye of the modern world. But blues isn't the only music here. There are parlor songs such as \"Spirit on the Water,\" where love is as heavenly and earthly a thing as exists in this life. The band swings gently and carefree, with Denny Freeman and Stu Kimball playing slippery -- and sometimes sloppy -- jazz chords as Tony Garnier's bass and George Receli's sputtering snare walk the beat. Another, \"When the Deal Goes Down,\" tempts the listener into thinking that Dylan is aping Bing Crosby in his gravelly, snake-rattle voice. True, he's an unabashed fan of the old arch mean-hearted crooner. But it just ain't Bing, because it's got that true old-time swing.</p><p>Dylan's singing style in these songs comes from the great blues and jazzman Lonnie Johnson (whose version of the Grosz and Coslow standard \"Tomorrow Night\" he's been playing for years in his live set). If you need further proof, look to Johnson's last recordings done in the late '50s and early '60s (\"I Found a Dream\" and \"I'll Get Along Somehow\"), or go all the way back to the early years for \"Secret Emotions,\" and \"In Love Again,\" cut in 1940. It is in these songs where you will find the heart of Dylan's sweet song ambition and also that unique phrasing that makes him one of the greatest blues singers and interpreters ever. Dylan evokes Muddy Waters in \"Rollin' and Tumblin.\" He swipes the riff, the title, the tune itself, and uses some of the words and adds a whole bunch of his own. Same with his use of Sleepy John Estes in \"Someday Baby\".. Those who think Dylan merely plagiarizes miss the point. Dylan is a folk musician; he uses American folk forms such as blues, rock, gospel, and R&B as well as lyrics, licks, and/or whatever else he can to get a song across. This tradition of borrowing and retelling goes back to the beginning of song and story. Even the title of Modern Times is a wink-eye reference to a film by Charlie Chaplin. It doesn't make Dylan less; it makes him more, because he contains all of these songs within himself. By his use of them, he adds to their secret histories and labyrinthine legends. Besides, he's been around long enough to do anything he damn well pleases and has been doing so since the beginning.</p><p>Modern Times expresses emotions and comments upon everything from love (\"When the Deal Goes Down,\" \"Beyond the Horizon\") to mortality (\"The Levee's Gonna Break,\" \"Ain't Talkin\") to the state of the world -- check \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" where Dylan sings gently about the \"buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down/Money's getting shallow and weak...they say low wages are reality if we want to compete abroad.\" But in the next breath he's put his \"cruel weapons on the shelf\" and invites his beloved to sit on his knee. It's a poignant midtempo ballad that walks the line between the topical songs of Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie to the love songs of Stephen Foster and Leadbelly. One can feel both darkness and light struggling inside the singer for dominance. But in his carnal and spiritual imagery and rakish honesty, he doesn't give in to either side and walks the hardest path -- the \"long road down\" to his own destiny. This is a storyteller, a pilgrim who's seen it all; he's found it all wanting; he's found some infinitesimal take on the truth that he's holding on to with a vengeance. In the midst of changes that are foreboding, Modern Times is the sound of an ambivalent Psalter coming in from the storm, dirty, bloodied, but laughing at himself -- because he knows nobody will believe him anyway.</p><p>Dylan digs deep into the pocket of American song past in \"Nettie Moore,\" a 19th century tune from which he borrowed the title, the partial melody, and first line of its chorus. He also uses words by W.C. Handy and Robert Johnson as he extends the meaning of the tome by adding his own metaphorical assets/images and wry observations. However, even as the song is from antiquity, it's full of the rest of Modern Times bemusement. \"The Levee's Gonna Break\" shakes and shimmies as it warns about the coming catastrophe. Coming as it does on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, it's a particularly poignant number that reveals apocalypse and redemption and rails on the greedy and powerful as it parties in the gutter. There are no sacred cows -- when Dylan evokes Carl Perkins' exhortation to put \"your cat clothes on,\" it's hard not to stomp around maniacally even as you feel his righteousness come through. The great irony is in the final track, \"Ain't Talkin',\" where a lonesome fiddle, piano, and hand percussion spill out a gypsy ballad that states a yearning, that amounts to an unsatisfied spiritual hunger. The pilgrim wanders, walks, and aspires to do good unto others, though he falters often -- he sometimes even wants to commit homicide. It's all part of the \"trawl\" of living in the world today. Dylan's simmering growl adds a sense of apprehension, of whistling through the graveyard, with determination to get to he knows not where -- supposedly it's the other side of the world. The guitar interplay with the fiddle comes through loud and clear in the bittersweet tune. It's like how \"Beyond the Horizon\" uses gypsy melodies and swing to tenderly underscore the seriousness in the words. It sends the album off with a wry sense of foreboding. This pilgrim is sticking to the only thing he knows is solid -- the motion of his feet.</p><p>Modern Times portrays a new weird America, even stranger than the old one, because it's merely part of a world consumed by insanity. In these ten songs, bawdy joy, restless heartache, a wild sense of humor, and bottomless sadness all coexist and inform one another as a warning and celebration of this precious human life while wondering openly about what comes after. This world view is expressed through musical and lyrical forms that are threatened with extinction: old rickety blues that still pack an electrically charged wallop, porch and parlor tunes, and pop ballads that could easily have come straight from the 1930s via the 1890s, but it also wails and roars the blues. Modern Times is the work of a professional mythmaker, a back-alley magician, and a prophetic creator of mischief. He knows his characters because he's been them all and can turn them all inside out in song: the road-worn holy man who's also a thief; the tender-hearted lover who loves to brawl; the poetic sage who's also a pickpocket; and the Everyman who embodies them all and just wants to get on with it. On Modern Times, all bets are off as to who finishes the race dead last, because that's the most interesting place to be: \"Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind/Bring me my boots and shoes/You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline/Sing a little bit of these workingman blues.\" There is nothing so intriguing as contradiction and Dylan offers it with knowing laughter and tears, because in his songs he displays that they are both sides of the same coin and he never waffles, because he's on the other side of the looking glass. Modern Times is the work of an untamed artist who, as he grows older, sees mortality as something to accept but not bow down to, the sound that refuses to surrender to corruption of the soul and spirit. It's more than a compelling listen; it's a convincing one.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><hr/><p>As an artist and a conundrum, Bob Dylan is well-versed in semi-hysterical critical hyperbole. With each new record since 1997's stellar Time Out of Mind, music writers and editors have been tripping all over themselves trying to sputter out the best, most dramatic encapsulation of Dylan's rebirth (which, given the relative late-career flops of his peers and his own 1980s shitstorm, still seems strange and thrilling). Now, 45 years into a perfectly studied, over-anthologized, well-chronicled career, even talking about the cult-of-Dylan seems clichéd: Analysis of Dylan-love, Dylan-backlash, Dylan-histrionics, and Dylanology is moot. Books have been published, academic treatises have been defended, documentaries have been ordered and directed, cover stories have been savored and parsed-- but every time Bob Dylan cranks out a new record, we still try, again, to figure out what it all adds up to.</p><p>Modern Times is Bob Dylan's 31st studio LP, and an obvious companion piece to 2001's Love and Theft, offering new tracks of jazz-inspired, rockabilly-scamming, ragtime-aping rock'n'roll, more heavily indebted to blues and honky-tonk than Woody Guthrie and Folkways. The record does little to persuade disbelievers, will continue to infuriate those who cheered when Pete Seeger jerked the plug at Newport, and isn't entirely unfamiliar: Anyone who's seen Dylan play in the past five years will recognize the silhouette here, hunched over a keyboard, all crags and angles, brambles of hair puffing out from under a big black hat, pencil mustache combed into place, pounding keys, infinitely more compelled by his fellow players than his sycophantic audience. Unsurprisingly, Modern Times is musically intricate, thick, and expertly played, more the product of a well-rehearsed-- but still gorgeously mellow-- band than an auteur. It also contains some of the softest, funniest, and most charming songs of Dylan's late career, as he snickers to himself, cooing about love, God, and doing it (\"I got the pork chops/ She got the pie\").</p><p>Dylan recently spat a series of (now-notoriously) curmudgeonly comments to Jonathan Lethem in Rolling Stone, pining that nothing sounds like shellac-- and while his complaints seemed depressingly stodgy, they were also promptly misconstrued and yanked out of context; as it were, Dylan was deriding contemporary production/studio techniques and not the whole of modern music, which becomes instantly and weirdly obvious to anyone who listens to the lyrics to raucous opener \"Thunder on the Mountain\" (\"I was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't help from crying/ When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line/ I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be/ I been looking for her even clean through Tennessee\"), or considers the fact that Dylan produced this record himself (under favored stage-name Jack Frost).</p><p>Still, it's obvious that Dylan's most beloved songs are old ones, and he borrows gleefully from Nina Simone, Memphis Minnie, Carl Perkins, Muddy Waters, and, in the grand tradition of AP Carter and John Lomax, plenty of unnamed songwriters whose work long ago slipped into public domain. \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" (Muddy Waters famously recorded the song in 1950, but its origins date back to at least 1929) is given a new workup, infused with Dylan's signature clatter and wheeze and punched up with peppery guitar and even spicier lyrics (\"I got trouble so hard, I just can't stand this dream/ Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains\"). Meanwhile, \"Nettie Moore\" (a well-worn 19th century ballad) is staggering, a spare blend of vocals and light, airy instrumentation, Dylan's decaying pipes tut-tutting sweet proclamations of love: \"When you're around me/ All my grief gives way/ A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day/ Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong.\" \"Workingman's Blues 2\" is similarly gentle and lapping, and \"The Levee's Gonna Break\", with its familiar Zeppelin-via-Memphis-Minnie refrain (\"If it keeps on raining/ The levee's gonna break\"), seems almost self-referential (\"I paid my time/ And now I'm as good as new…Some of these people are gonna strip you of all they can take\").</p><p>The biggest disappointment here is that Modern Times is probably Dylan's least-surprising release in decades-- it's the logical continuation of its predecessor, created with the same band he's been touring with for years, fed from familiar influences, and sprinkled with all the droll, anachronistic bits now long-expected. Dylan's voice, sinking further into grit, is all wheeze and mew, rolled in salt but still instantly recognizable. And now that he's eyebrows-deep in the rock'n'roll canon, maybe the heart-stopping appeal of Bob Dylan has less to do with his output-- which, tangentially, remains outstanding-- and more to do with his cowboy boot-saunter. Maybe we all want a little bit of Dylan's superhuman restraint, and whether it's real or brutally calculated doesn't actually matter: The fuck-off detachment, the unconcerned genius, the squinty-eyed disdain, the arid, gut-punching humor, the total (if feigned) disinterest in his growing superhero status. He's the boy who doesn't love us back, the one everyone yearns for, the Holy Grail, the last American hero.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This album, which reached the Top 20 in America and got to number four in England, showcased the group at its least pretentious and most musicianly — with the exception of a few moments on \"Three Fates\" and perhaps \"Take a Pebble,\" there isn't much excess, and there is a lot of impressive musicianship here. \"Take a Pebble\" might have passed for a Moody Blues track of the era but for the fact that none of the Moody Blues' keyboard men could solo like Keith Emerson. Even here, in a relatively balanced collection of material, the album shows the beginnings of a dark, savage, imposingly gothic edge that had scarcely been seen before in so-called \"art rock,\" mostly courtesy of Emerson's larger-than-life organ and synthesizer attacks. Greg Lake's beautifully sung, deliberately archaic \"Lucky Man\" had a brush with success on FM radio, and Carl Palmer became the idol of many thousands of would-be drummers based on this one album (especially for \"Three Fates\" and \"Tank\"), but Emerson emerged as the overpowering talent here for much of the public.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>John Fahey was a lover, first picking up the guitar in a gas station as a means of picking up chicks. So a good way to become enamored with Fahey's catalog is to just pick any track fixated on a woman, and go from there: \"Impressions of Susan\", \"A Raga Called Pat\", \"Requiem for Molly\", \"Beverly\", \"Juana\", or on this particular disc, \"Marilyn\". Each lady is lovely, dark, ultimately unknowable. Is Juana really a waitress in     Oregon?  Was Molly really out on Knott's Berry Farm?  Who was this Marilyn? She is lush yet sad, and that might even be her squinched up on the cover, painfully reclining and staring out into space. When Fahey is playing her, it's at a much slower pace than the rest of the first side of this 1974 reissue. </p><p>Second guitarist Woodrow Mann's second guitar glistens across Fahey's lead, each taking their sweet time in waving goodbye to her. The small diversions they take along every line are as exceptionally     awkward as any of Thelonious Monk's irregularly melodic spurs, yet for all the unhurried and dissonant playing, the quickly picked finale shines a brighter hue on this lovely figure. Apart from the ladies, this particular session shows how Fahey's talents took him much further afield of the blues path than most people will credit him for. Here he tackles in succession \"In a Persian Market\" and the Hindu chant \"Jaya Shiva Shankarah\", the two guitars twining around their Byzantine themes with a heck of a lot of flange, giving the fluctuating fingerpicked patterns a secondary weaving of soundwaves.\"Old Fashioned Love\" is prime Fahey playing in its own right, but with the midway appearance of the oldtimey orchestra consisting of jug, banjo, clarinet, tuba, trumpet, trombone, piano, and drums, the ditty goes     to a place seldom heard elsewhere in the man's catalog. The affected cymbal crash at the end also gives it an odd modern spin that confounds them ornery notions of time and nostalgia. John was never that easy to glean.</p><p>\"Boodle Am Shake\" sounds straight off the shellac itself, Fahey blending into the background of the ensemble perfectly and sending up that wonderfully ridiculous refrain-- it's the one of the few instances     of standard singing in his oeuvre. Fred McDowell's standard \"Keep Your Light Trimmed and Burning\" is recast here as a 1920's big band number to excellent effect, the Fahey arrangement a particular surprise. Very rarely would he work with so many attuned musicians before or after this point. The set closes with one of his truly magical works, \"Dry Bones in the Valley (I Saw the Light Coming Shining 'Round and 'Round)\", which was a gateway for many through the cover     version exacted with Tony Conrad on Gastr del Sol's Upgrade and Afterlife set. The effects are off, the session musicians sent home, and it's a beatific example of Fahey's opened steel strings resonating into     the infinite, droning yet with numerous emotional contours unfurling in the chiming notes.</p><p> It may have aged 28 years, but Old Fashioned Love remains a consistently surprising collection of Fahey's many loves.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Andy Beta, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In retrospect, <i>Try Whistling This</i>, Neil Finn's solo debut, seems like a conscious effort to distance himself from Crowded House. Filled with studio trickery, distorted microphones, and trendy vague trip-hop beats, the album was a deliberate move to establish himself as a separate, more adventurous entity from Crowded House — yet one that remained a gifted, melodic songwriter. This is all put into sharp relief by his second solo album, <i>One Nil</i>, a record that finds him returning to solid ground, delivering his most straightforward album since Crowded House's <i>Woodface</i>. Curiously, for an album that plays to his strengths, a good portion is the result of a fruitful collaboration with Wendy & Lisa, plus a production pairing with Tchad Blake and numerous cameo spots, including Sheryl Crow, Lisa Germano, and Mitchell Froom. For all the guests and star power, the record is surprisingly subtle, lacking the knockout punches of <i>Try Whistling This</i>, where the singles leapt out of the grooves. This time around, the songs are gently insinuating, slowly working their way into the subconscious. Even the songs with the biggest hooks, such as the first single \"Rest of the Day Off,\" aren't as immediate as \"She Will Have Her Way.\" Yet, on repeated plays, the record begins to gel, revealing itself as a reliably solid effort from Finn. There may not be any new revelations, yet the little details — the turns of phrase, the gently persuasive melodies, the slyly detailed productions — all confirm his status as a gifted craftsman. </p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Nearly ten years after their first album as a duo, the Finn Brothers returned with <i>Everyone Is Here</i> in the late summer of 2004. There was a considerably larger gap of time separating <i>Everyone Is Here</i> and <i>Finn</i> than there was between that album and <i>Woodface</i>, the one Crowded House album to feature Tim and the first time the brothers worked together since the disbandment of Split Enz. Only four years separated <i>Finn</i> and <i>Woodface</i>, while it took nearly a decade for the Finns to deliver a second album, and quite a bit happened during that time. Each brother released two studio albums and one live album (Tim's was a collaborative live effort, but it could be argued that Neil's star-studded <i>7 Worlds Collide</i> was collaborative too) and, more importantly, their mother Mary passed away, and all of this feeds into the spirit, vibe, and sensibility of <i>Everyone Is Here</i>. At its heart, this is an album about family — specifically, about being brothers. </p><p>This is the first time the Finns have written as directly and abundantly about their kinship, and unlike other famous rock siblings, the Finns' relationship is not only cordial but loving, which doesn't mean that it's any less complex than such legendarily combative brothers from the Everlys through the Gallaghers. Tim and Neil mine their relationship throughout the album — the word \"brother\" seems to appear here more often than the entirety of their past work — and they've come up with a moving set of songs that may not add up to a concept album yet are surely unified by a set of themes. Similarly, despite three different sets of producers (primarily Mitchell Froom, but also Jon Brion and Tony Visconti for individual tracks) the album boasts a unified sound, particularly in comparison to the rather ragged, seemingly unfinished Neil effort <i>One Nil</i> (distilled and strengthened in its American incarnation, One All) or Tim's <i>Feeding the Gods</i>. It's a meditative, expertly crafted mature pop record, filled with subtle sonic textures — ranging from banjos to harmoniums, all adding colors to layers of primarily acoustic guitars — that give this low-key, reflective music a rich variety of color. While <i>Everyone Is Here</i> lacks the brightness of much of <i>Woodface</i>, it's the Finn Brothers' strongest collection of songs since that masterpiece, and arguably their most emotionally resonant album to date. With any luck, it won't be another decade's wait until the sequel. </p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Though the elegant return of pop-savant sibling duo Neil and Tim Finn arrived in August, Everyone Is Here isn't a summer record. Beneath super-slick production by Mitchell Froom (along with toast-of-Hollywood Jon Brion and Bowie/T. Rex knob-twiddler Tony Visconti) and the Down Under brothers' usual surging melodies, a barely disguised melancholy broods like an evil Finn twin chained up in the basement. The Finns' latest is glossy, emotional, and sure to satisfy longtime listeners&mdash;as well as any Stereophonics or Aqualung fans paying their respects.</p><p>Tim, the elder Finn, was the first to come to international prominence, fronting clownishly costumed new-wavers Split Enz. Little brother Neil joined up on guitar prior to 1977's Dizrhythmia, and in 1979 his composition \"I Got You\" became the band's breakthrough hit. After garnering MTV airtime with videos like \"Six Months in a Leaky Boat\", the group folded in the mid-1980s. Tim pursued a solo career, while Neil went on to lead Crowded House, whose \"Don't Dream It's Over\" remains as brilliant as it is inoffensive (I'm pretty sure I heard it at a dentist's office once while getting a tooth filled, but I still put it on mix CDs). The brothers reunited for Crowded House's 1991 Woodface, which still stands as their collaborative high watermark; their first album as The Finn Brothers, 1995's Finn, was an exotic, eclectic affair.</p><p>While not on par with that mid-90s LP, Everyone Is Here combines the skillfully crafted pop effervescence of Woodface and the moodiness of Finn. Opener and first single \"Won't Give In\" is a catchy bit of lite-rock, introducing the gorgeous brotherly harmonies that recur throughout the record. But it also includes lines like \"We all have to die alone\". The song, with its \"Everyone I love is here\" chorus, is both a celebration of life and a middle-age awareness of death's nearness. The Finns' mother died not long before the album's release, and a sense of mortality occasionally manages to leak through Froom's pristine production, lavish strings and all.</p><p>The sadness floats to the top on \"Edible Flowers\", a mawkish piano ballad that some will surely love. \"Everybody wants the same thing,\" the brothers sing, \"to see another birthday.\" Sure, that and an iPod. But the typically swooning chorus, while a touch easy-listening, is lush enough that it renders the sad-eyed lyrics superfluous. The bouncy, overproduced \"Homesick\" could be an anthem for disaffected progressives unable to secure Canadian residency (\"Homesick for the country that I'm living in\"), but it's really another example of the pathos lurking below the band's popcraft. Closer \"Gentle Hum\" provides four and a half minutes of calm, almost-meditative reflection apropos of the track's name.</p><p>Not everything here is as seamless as the brothers' interlocking voices. \"All God's Children\" starts off with a fit of garage-y guitar downstrokes (you know, like that one Strokes song) and then engages in a possibly tongue-in-cheek discussion of theogony worthy of Kevin Smith's self-importantly silly Dogma. The bright, earnest \"Anything Can Happen\" is hook-filled enough to be a single, but it and the subsequent love song \"Luckiest Man Alive\" rarely go past the cliches of their refrains (much like Mick Jagger's new \"Old Habits Die Hard\"). You'd think lifelong songwriters would be able to come up with titles that hadn't already been used by Air Supply, in Jagger's case, and World In Motion-era Jackson Browne, for the Finns.</p><p>The album is at its best when the brothers' knack for pop melodies meets subject matter that is poignant, not maudlin or even merely sufficient. \"Disembodied Voices\" fulfills this album's promise, reminiscing about brotherhood, childhood, and harmony. That's what Everyone Is Here is really about. Again, from the opener: \"Everyone I love is here/ Play it once, then we disappear.\" Darkness might be gathering somewhere, but loved ones can always gather together and raise their voices above the din to achieve a brief, transitory, but undeniable peace. Even if that means sounding like late-period Wings.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Marc Hogan, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

The raw groove of one of Green's most famous compositions, \"Black Magic Woman,\" the beautiful atmospherics of \"Albatross,\" and the shuffling cover of the Howlin' Wolf tune \"No Place to Go\" certainly highlight the early days of Fleetwood Mac and serve to document a fascinating group who commanded as much importance in the British psychedelic blues scene as much as the American pop scene.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Gregory McIntosh</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This Peter Green-led edition of the Mac isn't just an important transition between their initial blues-based incarnation and the mega-pop band they became, it's also their most vital, exciting version. The addition of Danny Kirwan as second guitarist and songwriter foreshadows not only the soft-rock terrain of \"Bare Trees\" and \"Kiln House\" with Christine Perfect-McVie, but also predicts Rumours. That only pertains to roughly half of the also excellent material here, though; the rest is quintessential Green. The immortal \"Oh Well,\" with its hard-edged, thickly layered guitars and chamber-like sections, is perhaps the band's most enduring progressive composition. \"Rattlesnake Shake\" is another familiar number, a down-and-dirty, even-paced funk, with clean, wall-of-sound guitars. Choogling drums and Green's fiery improvisations power \"Searching for Madge,\" perhaps Mac's most inspired work save \"Green Manalishi,\" and leads into an unlikely symphonic interlude and the similar, lighter boogie \"Fighting for Madge.\" A hot Afro-Cuban rhythm with beautiful guitars from Kirwan and Green on \"Coming Your Way\" not only defines the Mac's sound, but the rock aesthetic of the day. Of the songs with Kirwan's stamp on them, \"Closing My Eyes\" is a mysterious waltz love song; haunting guitars approach surf music on the instrumental \"My Dream\"; while \"Although the Sun Is Shining\" is the ultimate pre-Rumours number someone should revisit. Blues roots still crop up on the spatial, loose, Hendrix-tinged \"Underway,\" the folky \"Like Crying,\" and the final outcry of the ever-poignant \"Show Biz Blues,\" with Green moaning \"do you really give a damn for me?\" Then Play On is a reminder of how pervasive and powerful Green's influence was on Mac's originality and individual stance beyond his involvement. Still highly recommended and a must-buy after all these years, it remains their magnum opus.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Michael G. Nastos</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>As far as odds and ends packages go, Original Fleetwood Mac (1971) is an undeniably strong collection culled primarily from the band's first incarnation, featuring John McVie (bass/guitar), Mick Fleetwood (drums), Peter Green (guitar/vocals), and Jeremy Spencer (guitar/piano/vocals). As evidenced by the material, this quartet are an unmistakably blues-based combo. Early on they distinguished themselves as not only interpreters of traditional fare, but skilled composers, especially Green, who penned the vast majority of these selections. While their entire output during this era can be found on the six-disc Complete Blue Horizon Sessions: 1967-1969 (1999), the best of those secondary sides are contained within this disc. Green's total envelopment of the blues, coupled with equally inspired guitar craft, illuminate the traditional \"Drifting\" and \"First Train Home,\" as well as an adventurous, hopped-up cover of Muddy Waters' \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" titled \"Rambling Pony No. 2.\" \"Watch Out\" reveals Fleetwood Mac's decidedly jazzier visage. While the driving upbeat rhythm is deeply rooted in a Chicago-style delivery, Green's fretwork is undeniably fresh, giving the outing fuel for the combo's fiery contributions. \"A Fool No More\" is another notable variation and possible harbinger of their later psychedelic ventures. The instrumental \"Fleetwood Mac\" sounds as if it may have been taken from a jam session already in progress. The adaptation of Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup's \"Mean Old Fireman\" offers an acoustic pseudo-slide lead from Green, but ultimately it fails to truly ignite. B.B. King's \"Worried Dream\" is an interesting choice that would show up later in the band's concurrent concert repertoire.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

Although nearly all of the songs can be found on other Ford albums (most are from Handful of Blues), one of the things that makes this jazzy recording so special is that Ford is playing only an acoustic guitar. The Ray Charles gem \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\" (which you WON'T find elsewhere) is simply beautiful, and on Paul Butterfield's \"Lovin' Cup,\" it's just Ford and his guitar. The brilliance of his playing and the reason behind why so many guitar players put him at the top of their list can be found in Ford's performance on this release, alternating between lead and rhythm. The Authorized Bootleg also has great (albeit laid-back) versions of \"When I Leave Here\" and \"Tired of Talkin'.\" Highly, highly recommended.</p>&mdash; <b>Ann Wickstrom</b>"

His subsequent recordings &mdash; Ghost Town, Gone Just Like a Train, Blues Dream, Good Dog, Happy Man, and The Willies &mdash; were all approaches to the various folk styles that originated on American soil: country, blues, bluegrass, field hollers, jazz, and others. He has successfully been able to blend, extract, adapt, and otherwise morph one set of music onto another through his own approach to guitar playing &mdash; the song. More than any other contemporary guitarist, Frisell is driven by the notion of song &mdash; what it entails, both in terms of musical and cultural expression, and what it implies. On The Intercontinentals, Frisell continues his investigation of American music, but as a way of understanding how it entwines with the folk musics of other nations. Onboard for this outing are Frisell's longtime collaborators Jenny Scheinman; pedal, dobro, and lap steel guitarist Greg Leisz; as well as Brazilian mega-guitarist and songwriter Vinicius Cantuaria; Greek-Macedonian vocalist and oud player Christos Govetas and Malian percussionist and vocalist Sidikki Camara. Frisell had played with Camara and Malian uber-guitarist Boubacar Traore a couple of years before and was intrigued enough to explore the connection further. The result of this unlikely union is one of the most seamlessly beautiful works Frisell has ever produced. On it, he and Cantuaria delve into the modern Malian guitar and percussion sound pioneered by Ali Farka Toure; blend it with the timeless emotional resonance of Greek folk songs via Govetas' oud and infectious Brazilian lyricism; and filter it through shimmering country landscapes and otherworldly string textures that reinvent harmonic properties to suit the lyric of the blues, song, indigenous folk musics, and the contemporary improvisational ideal.</p><p>Frisell composed the lion's share of the tunes here, but there are also contributions by Gilberto Gil, Traore, Govetas, and Cantuaria. Scheinman's violin acts as a gorgeous signpost for virtually all of these musicians to return to; her melodic sensibility and crisp tone are beacons in the often swirling, escalating, and/or cascading whorls of plucked strings, playing as many as four melodies simultaneously with winding, almost knotty scalar interchanges. What is most fascinating is that even in the vocal tunes, or those where the Malian blues effect is the prominent force, everything else in the mix fans out and creates often contrapuntal backdrops for elegant and lush, if dense, textures. Simply put, this is the busiest record Frisell has made in years, but it doesn't feel like it. His sense of \"song\" is so pervasive, everything here is arranged to fit its \"singing.\" His own tone is unmistakable, as is Leisz's and Cantuaria's. The guitars are as distinct as the oud and the violin, all of them carried into the next space by hand drums. While each song does stand on its own as a harmonic and lyrical entity, with adventurous improvisation added in the spirit of true exploration, as an album they are linked by the weave of aural tapestry, dynamics, and spaciousness that is so central to Frisell's sound. And while this is more collaborative than perhaps anything he's done in a decade, it nonetheless bears his sonic and esthetic imprint. This is a remarkable album; its sets a new watermark for Frisell's sense of adventure and taste, and displays his perception of beauty in a pronounced, uncompromising, yet wholly accessible way.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Bill Frisell is a jazz guitarist primarily by virtue of the influence of jazz guitar virtuoso Jim Hall; otherwise, Frisell is an amazing amalgam of stylistic influences that make him something of the Cassandra Wilson of the guitar. Melding ambient soundscapes, the twang of country music, the wide-open chords of pure Americana, and the bluesy electric sculptures of Jimi Hendrix, Frisell is one of the most original guitarists to come down the pike in a long time.</p><p>On this recording, Frisell has surrounded himself with an auspicious jazz-based rhythm section consisting of powerful, innovative drummer Elvin Jones and bassist/composer/arranger Dave Holland. That both of these musicians have played in settings as varied as those in which Frisell has found himself promises a brilliant recording on paper, and this is one of those times when that promise is fulfilled in the actual recording.</p><p>The genre bending is present from the start, with the opening “Outlaws,” which morphs from a jangly guitar intro to a bluesy, discordant jazz piece to an open, swaggering shuffle. Jones shines, both defining and pushing the beat, while Frisell offers a virtual history of jazz and blues guitar influences. At the same time that he is playing what amounts to hard bop, he is delving into the Hendrix-by-way-of-Wes-Montgomery grab bag, and the trio swings as hard as any in recent memory. Dave Holland caps the opener off with a wonderfully melodic bass solo. “Twenty Years” is a waltz that allows all three players to demonstrate their mastery of space, with understatement being the key element. “Coffaro’s Theme” combines a folky sound with some ambient washes, with Frisell’s trademark pedals, loops, and tape effects sounding like an organic part of the mix. “Blues Dream” is indeed both bluesy and dreamy, with a late night feel and a few harmonic elements that hint at a more foreign locale than most of the tracks on the album.</p><p>If Frisell sometimes seems to mine the same Americana-laden sound as John Fahey, he does it with fewer nods at virtuosity and a more direct approach. His cover of Stephen Foster’s “Hard Times” is much looser, giving a jamboree jam approach to the piece that belies its lyrics, which are not heard here. While a bit more languid than one might expect to hear from guitarists of Foster’s time, the arrangement and overall feel convey the composition’s wistful, hopeful melancholy very well. The trio’s rendition of “Moon River” is simply gorgeous, stripping the song of its Breakfast at Tiffany’s association and portraying it as a beautiful melody with sophisticated harmonic underpinnings. Jones offers some stunning brushwork, and Holland’s support for Frisell’s solo flights are perfect.</p><p>One cannot help comparing this group with John Abercrombie’s Gateway trio, featuring Abercrombie on guitar, Holland on bass, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. That group has recorded four albums over a period of more than fifteen years, and I’d love to think that Frisell might find the results of this outing fascinating enough to repeat the experience periodically, though the chances of that are probably slim. Like the Gateway group, this trio demonstrates an amazing level of interplay, with Holland and Jones well able to get inside Frisell’s mind and offer not only support, but also real interaction and subtle colorations. I find it easy to imagine those who like to listen to more adventurous and improvisational rock-oriented guitarists loving this album as much as jazzheads. One of the elements of the Gateway group that was intriguing was its ability to do extended group improvisations that were musically successful, like some kind of jazzy Grateful Dead. Frisell, Holland, and Jones could no doubt provide some intriguing results with group improvisation as well. How about it, guys? If not, at least we have this album to enjoy, and if you enjoy guitar improvisation by a master musician, it comes highly recommended.</p>"

		"review": "<p>The allusion of the title East/West is an apt one; this live double-CD set is a study in contrasts. Recorded just six months apart with two different trios, Bill Frisell really shows both sides of his musical personality. The \"East\" disc was recorded in December of 2003 at the Village Vanguard with Frisell on guitar (acoustic and electric) and loops, Tony Sherr on acoustic bass and a bit of acoustic guitar, and Kenny Wollesen on drums and percussion. The program here consists largely of well-known standards with a couple brief improvisations and a single Frisell composition. The \"West\" disc was recorded at Yoshi's in May of 2004 and features Frisell (guitars, loops), Viktor Krauss (acoustic bass), and, well, Kenny Wollesen on drums (no other percussion), but this time the program is half Frisell compositions, a couple pop songs, and the traditional \"Shenandoah.\" On the \"East\" disc, only three of the ten tunes are longer than five minutes, but on the \"West\" disc only one track is shorter than eight minutes! The preponderance of standards on the \"West\" disc keeps the players mostly on the inside tip, even eliciting laughter from some audience members when Frisell hits the intro to the old warhorse \"People\" (to which he replies, \"you think I'm joking or what?\"). They do loosen up a bit at the end, for a wonderful arrangement of Willie Nelson's \"Crazy\" with two acoustic guitars and looping aural detritus, and there's a fun gallop through \"Tennessee Flat Top Box.\" The group improvisations also add a bit of spark. Folks who discovered Frisell in the late '90s with albums like Nashville are going to love this set.</p><p>Then there are the folks who discovered Frisell in the '80s as a major player in the downtown new music scene along with folks like John Zorn and Wayne Horvitz (fellow bandmates in the groundbreaking and genre-smashing Naked City band). For them, Frisell seemed to be losing his edge a bit as his trademark skronk was traded for acoustic textures. Richter 858 and the Grammy-winning (!) Unspeakable saw him revisiting that earlier sound to some degree, mainly through more extensive use of delays and loops, but the \"West\" disc here shows he's really back. \"Heard It Through the Grapevine\" starts out a bit slow, but right from the outset the delay plays a large role, ping-ponging ugly harmonics back and forth as an intro before hitting the first verse. It gradually picks up momentum, until the delays return and Frisell adopts a roaring backward-sounding tone for the end. \"Blues for Los Angeles\" has even more great looping, some pretty menacing sounds, and some fantastic soloing. \"Pipe Down\" (originally on Nashville) gets a much slower deconstructed treatment, then kicks into high gear with a serious groove. This set is way more adventurous than the \"East\" one, and might surprise some old fans who haven't been paying close attention of late. Frisell retreats a bit from the edge for the last track, a nice reading of \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" where the delay plays little to no role. With both bands, the rhythm section offers great support, but interestingly, Tony Scherr gets a bit of solo space while Viktor Krauss gets none. Then there's the fact that the album is called East/West, but the \"West\" disc (the later of the dates) is programmed as the first disc, so you listen to the sets in reverse chronological order as well as the opposite of what the title implies (perhaps \"West/East\" would have been more appropriate). And while this set is indeed a study in contrast, the common thread is the absolute guitar mastery and singular style and tone of Frisell. His use of double stops, open string voicings, and chordal leads in his playing, not to mention that slippery tone, makes him one of the most recognizable voices in music no matter what the context. And it's clear that Frisell is at home in any context, from playing chestnuts like \"The Days of Wine and Roses\" to John Zorn speed metal. The fairly naked trio context of East/West really gives the listener a chance to appreciate exactly what he can do, no matter which musical direction they're coming from.</p>&mdash; <b>Sean Westergaard</b>"

Majestically opening with an acoustic guitar, the song finds Gabriel's talents gelling, as the words and music feed off each other, turning into true poetry. It stands out dramatically on this record, not because the music doesn't work, but because it brilliantly illustrates why Gabriel had to fly on his own. Though this is undeniably the work of the same man behind The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, he's turned his artiness inward, making his music coiled, dense, vibrant. There is still some excess, naturally, yet it's the sound of a musician unleashed, finally able to bend the rules as he wishes. That means there are less atmospheric instrumental sections, as there were on his last few records with Genesis, but unhinged bizarreness in the arrangements, compositions, and productions, as the opener \"Morbund the Burgermeister\" vividly illustrates. He also has turned sleeker, sexier, capable of turning out a surging rocker of \"Modern Love.\" If there is any problem with Peter Gabriel, it's that Gabriel is trying too hard to show the range of his talents, thereby stumbling occasionally with the doo wop-to-cabaret \"Excuse Me\" or the cocktail jazz of \"Waiting for the Big One\" (or, the lyric \"you've got me cookin'/I'm a hard-boiled egg\" on \"Humdrum\"). Still, much of the record teems with invigorating energy (as on \"Slowburn,\" or the orchestral-disco pulse of \"Down the Dolce Vita\"), and the closer \"Here Comes the Flood\" burns with an anthemic intensity that would later become his signature in the '80s. Yes, it's an imperfect album, but that's a byproduct of Gabriel's welcome risk-taking — the very thing that makes the album work, overall.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>Released after Security brought Peter Gabriel a gold record and Top 40 hit, the double-album Plays Live summarizes his first four solo albums quite well. Though these performances aren't as fearless as the ones that accompanied his first solo tours, they are surging and tight. Gabriel is a consummate performer and even if the tapes were slightly cleaned up in the studio, his passion is apparent throughout the record. It's a very good live album, but it really is only necessary for die-hard fans. [In 2002, Universal released a 12 song \"highlights\" disc.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Although he had thrived on live performance as a member of Genesis, Peter Gabriel waited until he was four albums and six years deep into his solo career -- with the hit album Security and the Top 40 \"Shock the Monkey\" chalked up to his credit -- before he took the plunge into concert recording with this album. Released as a double-LP and two-CD set (but also later in a single CD \"highlights\" edition, missing four songs), this is a fine summing up of the artist's early solo years. Most of his biggest hits and key album tracks are represented in tight, inspired performances -- the notes concede that some of what is here was sweetened after the fact in the studio, but the immediacy of the stage performances wasn't lost in the process, and that emotional edge and intimacy give songs such as \"Solsbury Hill,\" \"I Don't Remember,\" and \"Shock the Monkey\" a sharper, deeper resonance than their studio renditions, fine as those are. It's that side of the performance that makes this release well worth owning, for anyone enamored of Gabriel's voice or songs, even if nothing here wholly supplants the studio originals. And the band -- Tony Levin (bass, stick, backing vocals), Jerry Marotta (drums, vocals), David Rhodes (guitar, vocals), and Larry Fast (keyboards) -- is in excellent form as well. What is lacking is the cohesiveness that one might have gotten from a live album assembled from a single concert; derived from a multitude of shows, the individual songs are excellent unto themselves, but there's little sense (or even the illusion) from song to song of any forward momentum across the album, and that might be the one major flaw here. But this is a suitable capstone to the first phase of Gabriel's solo career, and also a peculiar one in certain respects -- given the effort that obviously went into assembling the album, the packaging is almost minimalist by the standards of live albums and double albums of the era (the LP version even put both platters into a single sleeve).</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Needless to say, it was also his most accessible, and, in that sense it was a good introduction to So, the catchiest, happiest record he ever cut. \"Sledgehammer\" propelled the record toward blockbuster status, and Gabriel had enough songs with single potential to keep it there. There was \"Big Time,\" another colorful dance number; \"Don't Give Up,\" a moving duet with Kate Bush; \"Red Rain,\" a stately anthem popular on album rock radio; and \"In Your Eyes,\" Gabriel's greatest love song, which achieved genuine classic status after being featured in Cameron Crowe's classic Say Anything. These all illustrated the strengths of the album: Gabriel's increased melodicism and ability to blend African music, jangly pop, and soul into his moody art rock. Apart from these singles, plus the urgent \"That Voice Again,\" the rest of the record is as quiet as the album tracks of Security. The difference is, the singles on that record were part of the overall fabric; here, the singles are the fabric, which can make the album seem top-heavy (a fault of many blockbuster albums, particularly those of the mid-'80s). Even so, those songs are so strong, finding Gabriel in a newfound confidence and accessibility, that it's hard not to be won over by them, even if So doesn't develop the unity of its two predecessors.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Clearly, that great span of time indicates that Gabriel was obsessive in crafting the album, and Us bears the sound of endless hours in the studio. It's not just that the production is pristine, clean, and immaculate, it's that the music is, with only a handful of exceptions (namely, the \"Sledgehammer\" rewrite \"Steam\" and the fellatio ode \"Kiss That Frog\"), remarkably subtle and shaded. It's also not a coincidence that Us is, as Gabriel says in his liner notes, \"about relationships,\" since the exquisitely textured music lets him expose his soul, albeit in a typically obtuse way. Since the music is so muted, it's no surprise that the album failed to capture a mass audience the way So did, but it's foolish to expect anyone but serious fans to unravel an album this deliberate. Gabriel is as adventurous as ever, yet he is relentlessly sober about his experiments, burying exotic sounds and percussion underneath crawling tempos measured atmospherics -- this is tastefully two-toned music, assembled by a consummate craftsman who became too immersed in detail to make anything but an insular, introspective work. Some gems are easier to unearth than others -- \"Digging in the Dirt\" has an insistent pulse, \"Blood of Eden\" and \"Come Talk to Me\" are quite beautiful, \"Secret World\" is quietly anthemic -- yet, given enough time, the record's understated approach and reflection becomes its most attractive element.

		"review": "<p>In 1997, Peter Gabriel was asked to pilot a visual project for London's Millennium Dome. OVO is a work based on the intersecting problems of race relations, environmental concerns, family issues, and fairy tales as allegories, violence, and more. And keep in mind that this was to be a visual piece. Gabriel, to meet the challenge for CD, added a ton of multimedia to the musical soundtrack: there is a drawn storybook, The Story of OVO, a view of the installation itself from every angle, and many stopgap notes, drawings, and the like. For the soundtrack, he enlisted the help of collaborators such as Elizabeth Fraser, Neneh Cherry (whatever happened to her third record, the one she did with Tricky?), Richie Havens, the Black Dyke Mills Band, the Electra Strings, Paul Buchanan (of Blue Nile), Adzido, the Dhol Foundation drummers, and Iarla Ó Lionáird from the Afro-Celt Sound System. Needless to say, the music is all over the map, from a rap version of the \"Story of Ovo\" to an Irish jig to Gabriel's percussive culture plundering soundscapes and new songs (including a truly dull rework of \"Digging in the Dirt\") to Eno-like ambiences to folk songs and new songs with Havens and Ó Lionáird singing like the opposite ends of a heavenly choir and Liz Fraser soaring over the Dhol Foundation drummers. It sounds awesome doesn't it? It should be. But it's not. OVO sounds labored, choppy, and pasted together, like it is the soundtrack to a visual installation, and feels incomplete without it. This is not a project like Passion was or even Birdy; it's a pastiche that attempts to be as ambitious as the installation project. And it is ambitious. Unfortunately, musically it isn't consistent enough to sustain the listener's interest for the entire length of the recording. It is a curious project with moments, but is most likely for hardcore fans only.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Geffen A&amp;R; executive Tony Berg was quoted a few years back as suggesting that Peter Gabriel should call his next album Peter Gabriel Makes Grown Men Cry. To this day, I'm not exactly sure how he meant that. Either: #1: Gabriel's songs have apparently continued to be so heart-wrenchingly emotional that men still shed tears simply at the sound of his voice. #2: He's such an anal perfectionist that it's taken him years to craft his latest studio album, and fans, as well as record execs, weep with frustration. As for the frustration thing, it's been eight years, and Gabriel still hasn't finished it.</p><p> 2000, however, did see the release of a new UK-only Peter Gabriel record titled OVO: The Millennium Show. The album is technically a soundtrack to the disastrous Millennium Dome show that occurred in England a year ago.  Just as Geffen attempted to convince the public that Beck's Mutations was not an \"official\" follow-up to Odelay, OVO is being deemed \"not the official follow-up to 1992's Us\". So, what's a fan to do, except simply take this as consolation for four-fifths of a decade of waiting? For one, they can hope that the real album is better.  OVO has its moments, sure, but it's also fairly inconsistent. The sentiment and plot&mdash;yes, there's a plot&mdash;is, in fact, so hackneyed it's hard to believe that Berg Implication #1 could be the case.  Despite all this, Gabriel does at times come through: a little over half of the record ranks alongside his early 90s work. Had the rest been cut, OVO's runtime would weigh in at 20 minutes less, but because they're all here, their mediocrity preserved in plastic for all time, the album's pitfalls prevent it from gaining consistency and cohesiveness.     </p><p>According to the liner notes, Gabriel has recruited some of his \"favourite voices\" to sing the bulk of OVO's material. The female presence is welcome; like Kate Bush and Sinéad O'Connor before them, Iarla O Lionaird and the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser provide a lovely, sensual atmosphere to their cuts. When Richie Havens and Paul Buchanan pop up, though, it's unclear why Gabriel, whose vocals would have lent themselves infinitely better to these songs, didn't just sing them himself.</p><p>\"The Story of OVO\" opens the album with promising, ethnically rich accompaniment, until Rasco (??) and Neneh Cherry start rapping.  In the more than thirty years Peter Gabriel has been recording, he's never before written a rap, and it becomes clear immediately: \"A long time ago in a far away land/ There was a man/ Who learned to understand.\" The Gabriel-sung chorus and the rhythmic closing almost make the trite lyrics worth enduring. Okay, they don't. But that's somewhat easily forgiven with a casual press of the 'skip' button.     The first half's only major standout, \"Low Light\", follows with a beautiful ambient feel and an intro previewing the orchestral melody of a later track, the musically stunning \"Downside-Up\". \"The Time of the Turning\" sounds nice initially, but ultimately reveals itself as mediocre, with Havens and Fraser taking lead vocals on a generally forgettable melody. \"The Weavers' Reel\" pairs a reprise of \"Turning\" with a formulaic, lifeless Celtic reel, augmented with an unforgivably cheesy dance beat. And \"Father, Son\" attempts to go the way of Gabriel's previous ballads, but with such a saccharine sentiment and ordinary melody, it goes the way of elevator music. It's after this track that the line of demarcation from indifference to actual greatness becomes apparent, since the next song sets a new standard of quality which is ultimately fulfilled by OVO's remainder. \"The Tower That Ate People\" is Gabriel's funkiest track since \"Sledgehammer\", with growling verse     vocals, phased guitars, overdriven organ, and a gorgeously haunting bridge melody. \"Revenge\" follows flawlessly with a breathtakingly strong, layered rhythm by African drum group The Dhol Foundation. And the 10-minute closing  collaboration with electronic artist BT, \"Make Tomorrow\", is consistently enjoyable throughout its extravagant running time, bearing enough melodic and tonal changes to keep the listener interested. But the best track by far arrives just before the ending. \"Downside-Up\" is, melodically, one of the best songs in Gabriel's entire catalog&mdash;and it was a damn strong catalog to begin with. The banal lyrics keep it from joining the ranks of his other classics, but the fluidity and richness of the chorus melody, and the skilled, outstanding guitar line that enters at the bridge, makes it a strong contender.</p><p>OVO should nicely tide over you longtime fans until the eventual     release of the forthcoming Up. It's inconsistent, though, and at     times overbearingly trite, but it does contain some surprisingly effective material. If nothing else, the $30 import tag is a better bargain for the obsessive fan than a plane ticket to Britain.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Spencer Owen, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Nearly a full decade after the release of Us, Peter Gabriel finally returned with new music in the summer of 2002 -- but it wasn't a new studio album, it was the soundtrack to Phillip Noyce's return to independent Australian cinema, Rabbit-Proof Fence. The film tells the true story of three Aboriginal girls who make a return to their home after being abducted by the government to serve as domestic help to a white family in 1931; as they make their journey through the Outback to their home, they follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, which had been constructed to prevent animals deemed agricultural pests -- including rabbits, dingoes, and foxes -- from crossing into Western Australia agricultural lands. This, understandably, is a moody, emotional piece, and Gabriel was an ideal choice for the soundtrack, since he proved with his score for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ that he could stay faithful to the indigenous music of the region while synthesizing it with his own synth-based art rock, providing a haunting, emotionally resonant soundtrack to the film. He does a similar thing here, using Aboriginal music as a foundation for much of his music, yet winding up with a score that's ultimately closer to Birdy than Passion. That's largely due to its long stretches of moody, spare keyboards, which dominate much of the album. The keyboards are the dominant sound here, not the rhythms, but it all blends together for a very evocative, dark yet hopeful set of music. It's not a splashy comeback, then, but a quiet return to something Gabriel does best -- creating soundscapes that are at once alien and familiar, eerie yet comforting. That he hasn't done this in a while does not diminish the fact that he's created a strong instrumental piece that stands on its own, outside of the film, holding its own with Birdy and Passion. And it only whets the appetite for a full-scale comeback.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Ten years is a long time, especially in pop music, but waiting ten years to deliver an album is a clear sign that you're not all that interested in the pop game anyway. Such is the case with Peter Gabriel, who delivered Up in 2002, a decade after Us and four years after he announced its title. Perhaps appropriately, Up sounds like an album that was ten years in the making, revealing not just its pleasures but its intent very, very slowly. This is not an accessible record, nor is it easy to warm up to, which means that many may dismiss it upon a single listen or two, never giving it the time it demands in order to be understood (it does not help matters that the one attempt at a single is the ham-fisted, wrong-headed trash-TV \"satire\" \"The Barry Williams Show,\" which feels utterly forced and out of place here, as if Geffen was pleading for anything resembling a single to add to the album). Really, there is no other choice for an artist as somber and ambitious as Gabriel to craft an album as dense as Up; those who have waited diligently for ten years would be disappointed with anything less and, frankly, they're the only audience that matters after a decade. And they're not likely to be disappointed, since this album grows stronger, revealing more with each listen. Initially, it seems to simply carry on the calmer, darker recesses of Us, but this is an uncompromising affair, which is to its advantage, since Gabriel delves deeper into darkness, grief, and meditation. It may take a while for him to emerge from the darkness -- there is little of the comfort of a \"Come Talk to Me\" or \"Blood of Eden,\" which are immediately soothing on Us -- but there are glimmers of hope throughout the album, even in its darkest moments. Again, it takes awhile to sort all this out -- to unlock the form of the songs, then their meanings -- and it's such a somber, hushed, insular affair that some dedicated listeners may not bother to spin it the appropriate number of times. But those serious fans who want to spend time with this will find that it does pay back many rewards.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

As such, it not surprisingly relies heavily on that disc, with seven of the 17 tracks originating from the album. Only about five tunes in this show can be considered \"hits\" (conspicuously absent is anything from his second and third albums) but most won't miss the many omissions since the performance is so consistently breathtaking. Gabriel is known for his elaborate, high-tech presentations and this certainly has its share of surprises. To reveal them would be unfair, since much of the excitement in watching a Gabriel show is seeing how his stage act -- here modernized for an in-the-round setting -- unfurls and reflects the songs. But suffice it to say, that unless you were there -- and even then -- Gabriel has plenty of tricks up his baggy black sleeves. Although he begins modestly, playing stark piano alone on an empty stage for a moving \"Here Comes the Flood,\" the ever-present and very visible orange-suited crew, which appears and disappears though trap doors in the fake floor, quickly adds the full band. Split screens display these techs looking bored under the stage, preparing for the next song, a video technique that is overused throughout the concert's 2 1/4 hour running time. Otherwise, the camera work is excellent, if a bit hyperactive at times. Vocal overdubs are kept to a minimum and the 5.1 surround mix is astonishingly vibrant and detailed. One new song, \"Animal Nation,\" is played, but it is not one of Gabriel's best and at nearly 15 minutes overstays its welcome. Also, the band introductions, which are chanted by the audience after the tune, might have been fun if you were there, but wear thin quickly. Still, this is a beautifully and imaginatively shot production caught in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Gabriel sounds great, as do the band members, many of whom, like bassist Tony Levin and guitarist David Rhodes, are longtime associates. It's a must for any fan of the British star and a riveting performance even for those unfamiliar with his work.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>This double-set sequel to Peter Gabriel's 2003 successful tour DVD Still Growing Up is twice as long and about half as effective as its predecessor. The package includes one hour-and-a-half disc of the same band playing much of the same material in supposedly smaller places, and a second documentary disc. The \"unwrapped\" title infers this might be unplugged, but that is not the case. These performances are simply from different, purportedly more intimate venues where Gabriel's legendary large theater theatrics were scaled down. Still, \"intimate\" is a bit of a misnomer, as he was still playing to thousands of people, even on these smaller gigs, and the lights and visuals are far more advanced than most acts ever attain. Most annoying is the editing of the songs on disc one, which cuts between different performances of a single tune being played in a variety of venues. This was not the case with Growing Up Live, which was shot at what seemed to be a single gig in Italy. The effect is unintentionally distracting and detracts from the intensity of the show. Even the inclusion of seven tunes not on the previous DVD, some of them of hits as popular as \"Solsbury Hill,\" \"Games Without Frontiers,\" and \"Biko\" -- all of which sound great -- are marred by the fast-cut editing and the incongruous pieced together approach. Disc two is an hour-and-a-half \"unwrapped\" documentary, produced and directed by Anna Gabriel. This uses the majority of the concert material from disc one, interspersed with frustratingly brief interview segments from Gabriel and the band that on occasion only vaguely relate to the song being played. The trick of projecting some of this footage onto Gabriel's face gets old quickly and having to sit through the same songs again just to see about 15 minutes of not terribly insightful interviews makes this extraneous for all but the most ardent Gabriel fans. The extras on both discs though might be worth the price of the package. You get a terrific version of \"In Your Eyes,\" without the quick cuts, along with \"No Self Control\" from 1988's out of print (as of this DVD's release in 2005) P.O.V. tour documentary. Disc two has three live-in-the-studio tracks of the road band playing \"Darkness,\" \"No Way Out,\" and \"Growing Up,\" along with a pair of tunes from a May 2000 appearance on the BBC show Later...with Jools Holland. All of them are well worth seeing and owning, upping the value of this release considerably. The Surround 5.1/DTS sound on both discs is also a big plus. Still, this a necessary purchase only for those fans who already own Growing Up Live and are willing to spend additional money on product that seems unnecessarily padded and not nearly as classy as has come to be expected from the artist.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Filmed live at The HMV Hammersmith Apollo London, on March 23rd and 24th, 2011, the show looks quite good. Multiple cameras follow Peter Gabriel as he moves around the stage as well as the different orchestral groups whenever they have prominent solos. During close-ups clarity is very good and during larger shots that capture the entire orchestra there are no serious shadow effects. Furthermore, motion-judder is not a serious issue of concern, while background noise is present only during a few selected shots where the camera captures the heavy red lights from an awkward angle. This being said, the actual camerawork/camera movement isn't overly impressive. The show was apparently filmed in 2D and 3D and there are various light and laser effects that simply look a bit over the top in 2D (see screencapture #2). I have not seen the 3D Blu-ray version of the show and therefore do not know how successful these effects are in 3D, but visually the 2D version is somewhat inconsistent for my taste. I also wasn't overly impressed by the raw footage from the stage camera which Peter Gabriel uses towards the end of the show - the idea is good but the execution isn't convincing. Regardless, there are no purely transfer-specific anomalies to report in this review. (Note: This is a Region-Free Blu-ray disc. Therefore, you will be able to play it on your PS3 or SA regardless of your geographical location).</p><p>There are three audio tracks on this Blu-ray disc: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English LPCM 2.0, and English Dolby Digital 5.1. I opted for the English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and later on did a few random comparisons with the other two tracks for the purpose of this review.</p><p>The English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track boasts a wide range of nuanced dynamics that handle the new arrangements for Peter Gabriel's songs very well. What impressed me the most was the lush orchestral sound and the prominent solos -- the bassoon and flute solos, in particular, sound as well rounded as the vocals (quite a rarity), while the strings are never overpowering. Surround activity is modest, but frankly, the new orchestral arrangements do not demand anything more than what the lossless 5.1 track delivers. Finally, balance is very good and there are no problematic audio dropouts or sync issues to report in this review.</p><p>The English LPCM 2.0 track is serviceable but lacks the depth and fluidity of the English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. A lot of the nuanced dynamics mentioned earlier are simply missing. This is fairly easy to hear if one compares \"Biko\" (listen and compare the double bass entry and the bassoon solo that follows) and \"Don't Give Up\". Lastly, I tested only two songs, but as expected, the English Dolby Digital 5.1 track is anemic at best. </p>"

		"review": "<p>After two critically acclaimed but commercially disappointing solo studio albums, Rory Gallagher unleashed this raging live disc in 1972 at the age of 23. It not only established him in the States, where he had toured only once previously (with his first band Taste, opening for Blind Faith on their brief tour), and was a worldwide hit. Gallagher blasts through rearranged versions of three Junior Wells songs (\"Messin' With the Kid,\" \"I Could've Had Religion,\" and \"Hoodoo Man\") and Muddy Waters' \"Bullfrog Blues,\" a holdover from his Taste days, like his fingers are exploding. Even on acoustic tracks like \"Going to My Home Town\" where Gallagher strums his mandolin with such ferocity it sounds like the strings are going to pop, he attacks with the intensity of a talented young man with something to prove. The songs average about six minutes, but Gallagher and his two-piece never let the energy flag. More crackling than even his best studio work, you can hear the electricity in the air as the Irishman shoots solos scorching with vitality and precision. The 2000 reissue includes two slow blues cuts, \"What in the World\" and \"Hoodoo Man\" where the guitarist pulls out his slide tricks, both are worthwhile additions. The liner notes feature a 1972 interview with the guitarist, but this is the only album of Buddha's 2000 reissued Gallagher catalog that doesn't include brother Donal's track-by-track synopsis. The crisp, clear remastered sound makes this one of the best live blues-rock albums ever, and one of the finest discs in Rory Gallagher's catalog. It's not quite like seeing him live, sweating through a vigorous, non-stop set, but it's the next best thing.</p>&mdash; <b>Hal Horowitz</b>"

Northern Ireland, in particular, was a rock & roll no-go area, but Gallagher never turned his back on the province and was rewarded with what history recalls as some of his best-ever gigs. Irish Tour 1974, in turn, captures some of his finest known live recordings and, while it's impossible to tell which songs were recorded where, across nine in-concert recordings (plus one after-hours jam session, \"Back on My Stompin' Ground\"), the energy crackling from stage to stalls and back again packs an intensity that few live albums -- Gallagher's own others among them -- can match. Highlights of a stunning set include dramatic takes on Muddy Waters' \"I Wonder Who\" and Tony Joe White's \"As the Crow Flies,\" a raw acoustic rendering that is nevertheless totally electrifying. A frustratingly brief snip of the classic Shadows-style \"Maritime\" (aka \"Just a Little Bit\") plays the album out in anthemic style and then, of course, there's \"Walk on Hot Coals,\" a marathon excursion that posterity has decreed Gallagher's most popular and accomplished statement -- a status that Irish Tour 1974 does nothing to contradict. It's foolish playing favorites, however. Even more than Gallagher's earlier (1972) Live in Europe album, Irish Tour 1974 confirms Gallagher not simply as the greatest bluesman Ireland ever knew, but as one of the island's greatest-ever performers. The 1999 remaster adds nothing in the way of bonus material (shame), but greatly improves the sound quality.</p>&mdash; <b>Dave Thompson</b>"

Although it lacks the kinetic spark generated whenever a musician performs in front of a live audience, BBC Sessions is one of the finest live sets in his catalog, thanks to its crystalline fidelity, strong performances and classy presentation. Certainly, this collection isn't for anyone that isn't already devoted to Gallagher, but for those that are, there's plenty to cherish here -- individual solos, impassioned vocals and good liner notes.

Graciously fielding some truly inane questions from the host of the German TV series, Gallagher nonetheless gives sincere answers, emphasizing the importance of bonding with the audience he plays for no matter the venue, He steadfastly refused to intellectualize what he does, but implies a serious, no-nonsense approach that carries over to his band. He is articulate if not eloquent, but then his guitar was his true means of expression after all.</p><p>It's startling to see what devotion Gallagher retained for his audiences and how that reciprocal loyalty fueled the fire of passionate performances. There are formal concerts here as well as jam sessions, including covers by Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. Rory is occasionally joined by keyboards, horns and harp for extra instrumental color as well as guests lke Scottish soulman and kindred spirit Frankie Miller as well as the former bassist of Cream, Jack Bruce, for whom Rory graciously relegates himself and his band to backup.</p><p>The additional instrumentation, as when Gallagher himself pulls out the bottleneck, merely extends the gutsy intensity of the playing, whether the frontman is in acoustic or electric mode. His intensity rarely falters, even when he's chording away on the mandolin during \"Going to My Hometown.

The 40 tracks that cover 43 tunes include the complete 1994 show on disc two along with bonus material on that second disc culled from the 1975, 1977, and 1985 shows. The first thing that hits you when watching the 1975 tapes is how great a guitarist he was when young and handsome at age 27. The playing is extraordinary and on target. If one looks at the cup as half full, the fact that Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix were gone at that age means that the 20 extra years of Gallagher music found here are a blessing and a plus. There are lots of different camera shots on the 1975 show, a high-energy edit to go along with the music, and some tremendous slide playing on \"Secret Agent\" (not the P.F. Sloan tune), a bluesy rocker that absolutely cooks. On disc two, fast forward ten years to 1985, and his proficiency on the acoustic guitar with \"Walking Blues\" is just as powerful as the loud electric guitar. Gallagher had played the legendary jazz festival with his band Taste on two occasions prior to these five solo performances, and during the 1994 show is almost a different fellow from the one you witness 20 years prior. An older blues statesman, he's not bouncing around on the stage in 1994, the guitar tones are decidedly lower, the growl is intact, and the music is just as exciting and pure. This package comes with an eight-page foldout that includes three pages of liner notes penned by London journalist Chris Welch. Extraordinary in its scope, this truly is a \"Definitive Collection,\" as the title says, and aside from the historical importance, is solid entertainment that will hold your attention.

Released in 2005, however, Rory Gallagher's music could not be more of an anachronism. Even with the late-'90s/early-2000s blues revival on public television, on recordings, and in stadiums and taverns across the globe, Gallagher's name is seldom mentioned. This set offers a portrait of a true guitar hero and songwriter, one whose flash never outweighed his substance, one whose work is so utterly and dazzlingly fresh it not only stands the test of time, but transcends it. Being an Irish bluesman was tough for Gallagher, especially when he began his career in the 1960s. Gallagher passed away in 1995 at the age of 47. He left behind 17 albums and a legacy of hard traditional blues and big, knotty blues-rock. These two discs are the first retrospective to span the entire length of his career from his time with the power trio Taste, to his signature albums like Calling Card and Deuce, through to his final acoustic album, Wheels Within Wheels (released posthumously). There are many gems here beginning with \"Born on the Wrong Side of Time\" by Taste, and unreleased live versions of the traditional \"Bullfrog Blues\" and Junior Wells' \"Messin With the Kid.\" The stone killers are cuts that Gallagher's fans recognize him for, such as \"Tatoo'd Lady,\" the title number from Calling Card, or \"I'm Not Awake Yet\" from Deuce. There are also fine moments from later in his career as well, such as \"Kickback City\" from Defender and \"Bad Penny\" from Top Priority (though it would have been better if the compilers had picked \"Philby\" or \"Follow Me.\") \"Sinner Boy\" is here from Live at the Isle of Wight, along with \"What's Goin' On\" (not the Marvin Gaye tune). While fans may quibble about individual selections, the only glaring omission is the absence of the stellar \"Walk on Hot Coals.\" The package is fine enough with numerous autobiographical quotes from Gallagher, a slew of good photos, and a good liner essay by David Sinclair. While it may be the tried and true devotees that seek this out ultimately, the music listener who would most benefit is the one interested in the evolution of blues or in fine guitar players. For the latter, Big Guns would be nothing short of a revelation.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Although Gallagher is in fine tough form here and it was his debut release for his own indie label, there is little difference between this and some of his less stellar '70s albums like Top Priority and Photo-Finish. The pounding, guitar-heavy opener \"Kickback City\" sounds more like hairy rockers Bad Company than anything approaching the deep Chicago and country blues Gallagher dearly loved. The quality picks up substantially as the volume subsides on \"Loanshark Blues,\" but by-the-books crunch-rockers like \"Failsafe Day\" and the unfortunately titled \"Road to Hell\" don't bode well for Gallagher moving out from an increasingly formulaic pigeonhole. There are a few corkers here like \"Continental Op,\" a blazing riff that stands with Gallagher's best work and revisits his familiar cloak-and-dagger theme. The swampy, less abrasive \"I Ain't No Saint\" also pushes the quality up a few notches, as does his gritty version of Sonny Boy Williamson's \"Don't Start Me to Talking,\" the bluesiest song on the disc and one of the few times he pulls out his greasy slide. \"Seven Days\" is the lone acoustic track and it's a good one, with piano and harp accompaniment and Gallagher singing like he means it as he takes the part of a criminal fleeing from the electric chair. The 2000 reissue adds a pair of rugged bonus tracks (along with a cleaner sound mix), which are actually better, or certainly as good as the best cuts on the rest of this competent but hardly essential Rory Gallagher disc.</p>&mdash; <b>Hal Horowitz</b>"

Unfortunate, because the disc opens with strength and gradually peters out by the end. The disc opens with \"He Came From the North,\" which features a melody based on a traditional Lapp joik from the artist's native Norway and progresses into a longer section with an interplay that is both sparse and rhythmic. The sax line here is astonishingly beautiful. The second piece, \"Alchuri, the Song Man,\" a sax and percussion piece, is energetic and lively as well. And from here the energy gradually diminishes. Much can be attributed to popular styles of the time, but this release simply does not stand up to other music of its genre that came later.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Allender</strong></p>"

This album in particular puts that sound front and center. Garbarek's the show; he composed all of the music, and is essentially the only soloist. The music (much of which was composed as soundtrack material for film or video) is quintessential Garbarek, full of the world music influences that have characterized his work since the 1970s. Garbarek's resonant, carefully articulated tenor and soprano tone suits the spacious, minor/modal themes. He's as much a singer as instrumentalist. Garbarek also plays digital synthesizers, mostly as string or flute pads underneath the folkish melodies. The record's most notable secondary player is Garbarek's ECM labelmate, the bassist Eberhard Weber, whose lyric sensibility is a virtual mirror of Garbarek's. This is quiet, contemplative music for the most part -- attractive, but not superficially pretty. Its grooves are less celebratory than melancholic. There's an intensity here borne of deep concentration and commitment to beauty. Garbarek has come a long way since his early days as a quasi-free jazz experimentalist. This music is not jazz, nor is it experimental. But it is compelling in its way, representative of a first-rate creative musician, beyond category.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Chris Kelsey</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Since the late '70s, Jan Garbarek has been carving out a place within jazz for the folk and spiritual traditions of the indigenous peoples of Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and finally of those people all over the world. Rites, a double CD, is his attempt at forging a synthesis that takes improvisation into the heart of ritual music and creates a new form of spiritual from them both. Using a strategy for each of the discs, the first one digs deep into the spiritual and mystical side of his language. Garbarek plays soprano and tenor as well as synthesizers, drum machines, and samples — always understated, always elegant — and utilizes the talents of some of his running mates as well as new ones. Rainer Bruninghaus appears sporadically throughout, as does bassist Eberhard Weber, and drummer/percussion wizard Marilyn Mazur is ubiquitous. The music is slow, tenuous, and repetitive. It hardly matters — on disc one, anyway — which of the pieces are being played. All of them have spare, chant-like melodies that are lifted by myriad percussion instruments and keyboards, which provide a spacious ambience in which to enfold them both. Even Garbarek's trademark icy saxophone — usually made more so by Manfred Eicher's production — is warm, watery, and deeply entrenched in this warm mix that falls over listeners like a fine meditation blanket; like that blanket, it begins to stir emotions from deep within the heart of the listener. While these songs all segue into one another, it is worth noting that Garbarek recut \"It's OK to Listen to the Grey Voice\" for this collection, where it's performed with deeper conviction and fits better than it did on the album it was named for. Disc two of Rites is a bit of a different story. While the music is indeed intended for ritual, it comes from the celebratory side of the aisle rather than the contemplative one. Here are dances, Garbarek's versions of gospel shouts, processionals, festival waltzes, and all manner of joyful ceremonies completing the circle. On one collection, listeners get music for prayer, contemplation, and grief, as well as a funky European read of indigenous music for moving to and celebrating. Clearly this is what sets Rites above Garbarek's other recordings, him taking that balance he possessed so early in his career back again and putting it to work in a near-sacred setting.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Here, their range straddles no less than three milleniums (just missing a fourth by a couple of years), from the \"Delphic Paean\" of Athenaeus circa 127 B.C. to a lullaby by the contemporary Estonian composer Veljo Tormis, with intervening contributions by Hildegard von Bingen, William Billings, and Thomas Tallis, Iroquois Indians, Basque and Peruvian folksongs, and many more far-flung choices. Most daringly, the four voices themselves now start to improvise on scraps of ancient material culled from old book bindings and the like, though it's hard to determine exactly where this occurs (probably during some passages of wordless vocalise). Ultimately, despite the freer methods, the results are often pretty much the same as Officium on disc one -- soothing, timeless sonic frescos reverberantly recorded in the same Austrian St. Gerold monastery, with Garbarek soaring over or threading through the texture ever more sparingly. Yet on disc two, Garbarek and the Hilliards start to move into other worlds, breaking into something more disturbing and even atonal in that ancient \"Delphic Paean,\" the syncopated harmonies of Garbarek's own \"Loiterando,\" or a strange-sounding Russian Psalm from the 16th century. This is a collaboration in transition, and one hopes it will continue to evolve.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>Jan Garbarek is the quintessential ECM artiste -- adventurous; disdainful of categories; in possession of a wailing tone well-suited to producer Manfred Eicher's reverberant, airy sonic tastes; and a devotee of the school of wide open spaces without clutter. The latter two points are important, for they unify what might otherwise be a wildly scattered collection of shooting asteroids into a single orbit. Giving all of this eclecticism some general shape, disc one of Garbarek's Rarum volume deals with his sessions as a leader, often with the ethereal mood in play, while the second disc is devoted to the Norwegian saxophonist's collaborations with his celebrated friends from Europe and America over a 22-year span. The first disc has a carefully terraced sense of flow from start to finish, with the opening horn calls of \"Skrik & Hyl\" and \"Viddene\" sounding as if they came from high on a mountaintop, with bass, then guitar, then pipe organ as backdrops. With \"Lillekort,\" things get moving in a light Brazilian bag with Nana Vasconcelos providing the groove and the nicely striding \"It's OK to Listen to the Gray Voice.\" The set then veers into some ethereal solo tracks, where Garbarek works with tapes of himself on excerpts from the albums All Those Born With Wings and Legend of the Seven Dreams and reaches a peak of energy on the penultimate track, the title tune of the Twelve Moons album. Within this overall context, the lengthy \"Raga I,\" with a host of Indian musicians, seems not at all out of place, nor is Shankar's playful \"Song for Everyone\" on disc two. Paying homage where homage is due, four of the first five tracks of disc two are some of Garbarek's collaborations with Keith Jarrett in the '70s -- ranging from the esoteric (the lugubriously orchestrated \"Windsong\" from Luminessence) to some snapshots of the Jarrett European quartet that put Garbarek on the map. Interestingly, in Jarrett's Rarum volume, the pianist writes that he would have liked to have included \"Sunshine Song\" (from Nude Ants) and a track from Luminessence on his own collection. What he doesn't say is that they turned up on Garbarek's album instead. A coincidence of telepathic tastes -- or concealed collusion? Aside from the European quartet tracks, the disc reverts to Garbarek's spare, freewheeling conception of sound, featuring sessions led by guitarists Ralph Towner and Egberto Gismonti, and finally a taste of Garbarek's audacious yet lovely collaboration with the early music Hilliard Ensemble. Alas, Garbarek's liner notes aren't of much use as a guide; he is merely content to thank some of his co-conspirators -- mainly Eicher and Jarrett.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S.

For In Praise of Dreams Garbarek enlisted violist Kim Kashkashian and frequent collaborator Manu Katché on drums. Garbarek, who composed the album's 11 selections, plays saxophones as well as a host of keyboards and percussion, while Katché plays acoustic and electronic drums along with Kashkashian's viola. In many ways this is the most radical recording that Garbarek has ever issued, but not because it's outside — quite the opposite. This is easily the warmest, most accessible outing Garbarek has ever issued because though there are no vocals, Garbarek has clearly written \"songs\" on this set, with identifiable structures that are followed almost throughout. Though he is no stranger to the form, having employed it almost continually for the last 20 years, he has never engaged it so thoroughly and completely. Previously, he has engaged improvisation to get song to the breaking point and move it somewhere else. Here it is always present; surprise happens inside the formal frameworks of these compositions. Beautiful, soulful lines underscore and recontextualize the saxophonist's trademark Nordic iciness of tone on the opener, \"As Seen from Above,\" with its spiraling soprano, lush keyboards, and hypnotic loops. In its warmth, it comes very close to a distinctly European kind of groove/soul-jazz.</p><p>The interplay between Kashkashian and Garbarek on the title track offers rounded, multidimensional sonorities winding through the intro before spilling into a call-and-response melody. The repetitive keyboard line and Katché's mantra-like drumming under the loops draw the listener inside the song's heart and extend the edge for the front line. The restrained romanticism shown by Kashkashian on her nocturnal solo intro to \"One Goes There Alone\" is nearly breathtaking. As it gives way to the tune itself, it's slow, reflective, and rooted deeply in the tension created between percussion and Garbarek's minimal backing response lines. When he solos later in the tune, he's clearly blowing blues into her elegiac line. The blues notion continues in his phrasing on \"Knot of Place and Time,\" slipping through the landscape of Kashkashian's elegant, near heartbreakingly poetic soundscape. And so it goes. Things get more speculative on \"Scene from Afar\" and \"Cloud of Unknowing,\" but it hardly matters since these song forms are nonetheless immediately recognizable, presenting the nether side of the equation. It emerges again with \"Conversation With a Stone\" and whispers to a close with \"A Tale Begun,\" a mantra-like duet that closes this strong set that will undoubtedly, if it gets the opportunity to be heard, garner Jan Garbarek some new fans. Poetic, moving, and marvelous, In Praise of Dreams is a welcome return.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

It is an interesting number for Mazur, because she has also spent 14 years as a member of saxophonist Jan Garbarek's recording and touring ensembles. He appears on about half of Elixir as Mazur's only collaborator (apart from producer Manfred Eicher). That said, the solo pieces are the first remarkable aspect of this set. When Mazur works alone, her pieces defy everything we think we know about solo percussion recordings: there is a warmth and directness in these proceedings that is songlike rather than merely hypnotic or virtuosic. There is much to tell here, not merely to show. These short works are, in effect, aural stories. They arise from her intuitive understanding of an instrument and sound as well as her improvisational abilities as a percussionist, but they emerge as almost sung narratives told on her array of bells, marimba, bowed vibraphones, log drums, udu, cymbals, gongs, waterphone, hang, and metal utensils -- instruments and tools from all of the earth's continents. They are startling vignettes, because they offer a connection to something earlier to be sure, but also to something very universal in their accessibility as a kind of folk art. When she works with Garbarek, the sheer intuitive nature of their communication is simply startling. They do know one another well, but this is truly out of the ordinary. To be honest, as fine as Garbarek's own records have been, listeners haven't really heard him play like this for many years. The structured melodies and dynamic reaches in \"Orientales,\" for instance, come from a very simple idea that he modulates on and returns to over and over again, but his intonation and sense of attack are very different than on his own records. Likewise, the tribal-sounding \"Dunun Song\" allows for the saxophonist to take his tenor and dance along a thematic idea that is as rooted in blues and New Orleans music as it is in African cultures. The relatively free abstraction in \"Winter Wish,\" the longest of these 21 improvisations at a little over four minutes, is nonetheless measured by Mazur's sense of pace and space, and how her own measured tones offer another voice for her collaborator. The beautiful cymbal, cowbell, and log drums on \"Creature Walk\" are knotty, ever shifting in pulse and timbre, but always toward rather than away from the listener. The nocturnal waterphone on \"Metal Dew,\" with the longish tones of shimmering small bells and rubbed cymbals, presents another piece of musical alchemy that, while sounding utterly strange and almost exotic, is nonetheless fantastically approachable and beautifully nuanced. In fact, the manner in which this album is structured draws the listener from front to back without once being overwhelming. Indeed, if anything, one is drawn increasingly and with great fascination into these gorgeous rhythmic poems, as if to a new land that is simultaneously welcoming and strange. Fantastic.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

He has recorded sparely in 21st century thus far, but he has toured regularly. For those who think that Garbarek abandoned jazz some time ago, this will be a shock. Dresden is an engaged, kinetic, double-disc, two-hour performance of his quartet playing in the modern jazz idiom and using all of its tenets -- from complex harmonics and rhythmic invention to extended lyric improvisation -- to create a tour de force that honors all the music he holds dear.</p><p>Garbarek plays tenor, soprano, and the selje flute; he is accompanied by his regular group that includes drummer Manu Katche, pianist/keyboadist Rainer Brüninghaus, and electric bassist Yuri Daniel. There are 16 compositions that include tracks from his own albums -- some of them radically but exquisitely revamped for this quartet and performance. There are also tunes by his bandmates, and an extended, stellar reading of Milton Nascimento's gorgeous \"Milagro Dos Piexes,\" that features some of the most inventive and dynamic dialogue between Garbarek and Brüninghaus on record.</p><p>The forcefulness of Garbarek's own playing will surprise casual listeners while making veteran's reference his earliest recordings for ECM. His solo on the opening cut, \"Paper Nut\" (a tune he composed for L. Shankar's Song for Everyone album), is immediately recognizable, yet is startling for its forcefulness and physicality. Likewise, Katche's double-timed yet groove-laden syncopation provides a backdrop for the saxophonist to move his harmonically extended meditation to the margins. And he does so in the middle, recalling the fireworks of his earliest recordings. His knotty arpeggios go head to head with his drummer, who simply cannot be shaken. When the ensemble comes together in the middle of the tune, they swing hard, and are added to by a gorgeous solo from Brüninghaus. Katche's in an amazing foil for Garbarek, because he understands not only the intricate shapeshifting and intensities in jazz, but has street grooves and rhythm & blues shuffles down cold -- in both vintage and modern contexts -- as well. Garbarek radically reworks \"Once I Wished a Tree Upside Down,\" a piece he wrote for Trilok Gurtu's Living Magic album. Whereas the former was comprised mainly of hand drums and synthesizers, this version, introduced by Brüninghaus playing a South African township cadence on the piano and Katche's breakbeats, is both streetwise and folk-rooted while being utterly redolent of 21st millennium jazz. The ballad \"There Were Swallows\" (one of the tunes from 1992's Twelve Moons album) loses none of its graceful restraint here, fueled by Brüninghaus' piano and sung poetically by Garbarek's soprano. The final track on the set, \"Voy Cantando\" from 1988's Legend of the Seven Dreams, clocks in at over 11 minutes and is arguably the toughest thing here; it's funky but with a long modal excursion in the middle and a very complex, tenor solo from Garbarek. \"Maracuja\" carries within it an easy sense of swing, a reggae backbeat, and contains killer basswork by Daniel, all within a folk song. The same goes for \"Heitor,\" which commences with a folkish melody and extends itself into the hinterlands of creative ensemble playing while losing none of its ability to swing.</p><p>In sum, Dresden is an event, not only in Garbarek's career, but in ECM's as we'll -- after all, it's their 40th anniversary this year, too -- in the same way that the Keith Jarrett's Köln Concert or the Out-of-Towners' trio date was. It's a live concert recording capturing nearly all the energy, creativity, and presences of sound and dynamics on compact disc that audiences in the seats encountered.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Peter Garrett was never made for politics. A passionate idealist, how he kept sane whilst his environmental policies and integrity were constantly sold out in the name of party politics, is anyone's guess.</p><p>Ironically, after resigning amidst the turbulence of the most pathetic era of Australian polutics (sic) – an era where our leaders (such as they are) and their integrity (if you can find any) became ever more one dimensional, spineless and blatantly dishonest – hindsight shows us that his charismatic, pre-politics self is arguably the Prime Minister this country needs more than ever, rather than the scumbags who are actually in the running for the job.</p><p>It seems inevitable, then, that he's come back to music, reforming Midnight Oil (despite vehement protestations by the organisation that that was NOT an option not too many months ago), and finally releasing his debut solo album.</p><p>Musically, A Version Of Now occupies the same sort of territory as The Oils. Lyrically there is a treasure trove of snippets which personal and political observers will (and have) leap upon to feed their theories about the whys and wherefores of his political career. To Garrett's credit, however, he doesn't use the album as a podium for mudslinging and muckracking – in fact, if anything, he defends his integrity, insisting in I’d Do It Again, 'I went of my own accord to do what I could/I got my hands dirty I had a go.' Can’t blame the guy for trying.</p><p>Freed of the need to compromise his beliefs and integrity in the name of (what is laughingly called) \"the greater good\", Garrett is surprisingly sanguine about a chapter of his life that simply didn’t live up to his aspirations. The closest he gets to commentary on those often dark days is in Tall Trees, stating, \"I saw the best of men and I saw the worse/I saw the best of woman too, from governor to nurse\" and \"While all the glory hunters were basking in false smiles/Twisted egos and ambitions mile after mile/I went to find a quiet place away from the madding mob/To try and make a difference get on with the job and do it again\". It's cutting, but measured as well, and no doubt after swimming in those murky waters the need for a return to home and family life was strong, hence the inclusion of not only two love songs to his wife Doris, but also his three daughters singing on the album.</p><p>Having delivered this very restrained (and very nice) album, and with an autobiographical memoir coming very soon, the time is ripe for Garrett to deliver a proper follow-up (under his own name or as Midnight Oil) that is full of the fiery political statement that he was famous for in his younger days.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Shane Pinnegar</strong></p><hr/><p>The fourteen years since the last Midnight Oil album have been eventful for Peter Garrett. Moving from music to politics, he spent much of this period as a part of Australia’s labour government party, which included many controversial choices during his years of service, only finding himself retiring from government work as recently as 2013. Now that this period is over, however, it’s no surprise that Garrett finds himself once again creating music; A Version of Now may be his first solo album, but it’ll sound familiar to most Garrett fans, even if it acts as a better lead-in to more Midnight Oil material than it does as a solo introduction.</p><p>Stylistically, A Version of Now is extremely straightforward and simple. The focus is always placed on Garrett’s easily identifiable, heavily accented singing, filling in the gap behind his voice with the music so they work in harmony rather than fighting for dominance. The lyrics cover what many would expect them to, from addressing his political career and the choices he made throughout it on I’d Do It Again, to simply announcing his return to music on the opening track Tall Trees. Meanwhile, Homecoming covers the period in which he returned home after his political career, with its sentimentality showing through clearly.</p><p>There’s nothing truly groundbreaking to be found on Garrett’s solo debut, but its familiarity is ultimately what fans will enjoy most out of it. Glimpses of his catalogue with Midnight Oil pop up throughout, and there’s the added bonus of songs like Homecoming not requiring any bells and whistles on top of their simple arrangement to truly stand out. The only truly unique moment on the album is when he approaches talk-singing at its extreme on It Still Matters, not quite at rapping speeds but covering much more lyrical ground than he does anywhere else, tying the album together nicely as he races to convey his message.</p><p>While it won’t win over any new fans, Garrett is more than ready to prepare fans for the return of Midnight Oil with A Version of Now, as if he were conveying his memoirs through this alternate channel to quickly address the political situation before launching back into band material. There’s no real groundbreaking moments on the album, and its one-note style would come close to dragging if it weren’t such a short album. Regardless, A Version of Now has its merits and sits well in Garrett’s discography.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Smith</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Thanks I'll Eat it Here is strikingly different from the fusion-leanings of Little Feat's last studio album, Time Loves a Hero. Lowell George never cared for jazz-fusion, so it should be little surprise that there's none to be heard on Thanks. Instead, he picks up where Dixie Chicken left off (he even reworks that album's standout \"Two Trains\"), turning in a laid-back, organic collection of tunes equal parts New Orleans R&B, country, sophisticated blues, and pop. George wasn't in good health during the sessions for Thanks, which you wouldn't tell by his engaging performances, but from the lack of new tunes. Out of the nine songs on the album, only three are originals, and they're all collaborations. That's a drawback only in retrospect - it's hard not to wish that the last album George completed had more of his own songs - but Lowell was a first-rate interpreter, so even covers of Allen Toussaint (\"What Do You Want the Girl to Do\"), Ann Peebles (\"I Can't Stand the Rain\") and Rickie Lee Jones (\"Easy Money\") wind up sounding of piece with the original songs. George's music rolls so easy, the album can seem a little slight at first, but it winds up being a real charmer. Yes, a few songs drift by and, yes, Jimmy Webb's vaudevellian \"Himmler's Ring\" feels terribly out of place, but Lowell's style is so distinctive and his performances so soulful, it's hard not to like this record if you've ever had a fondness for Little Feat. After all, it's earthier and more satisfying than any Feat album since Feats Don't Fail Me Now and it has the absolutely gorgeous \"20 Million Things,\" the last great song George ever wrote.</p> &mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Few musicians mirror Los Angeles's tradition of rock chameleons better than Lowell George, son of a Hollywood furrier and the brilliant, short-lived auteur that shaped Little Feat's '70s sound and fury before retreating to allow a more democratic if less gripping chemistry to surface. George's hearty but lyrical, blues-rimmed voice, signature electric slide guitar, and infectious, often surreal songs defined the band--as did his production on their pivotal mid-decade albums, which convinced more than a few listeners that they were Southerners. His 1979 solo album, recorded shortly before his untimely death, mixed new originals (\"Honest Man,\" \"Cheek to Cheek,\" \"Himmler's Ring,\" and the touching \"20 Million Things\" among them) with smart R&B covers from Allen Toussaint (\"What Do You Want the Girl to Do\") and Ann Peebles (\"I Can't Stand the Rain\"), dressed in tight brass choruses and sleek backing choruses, and fit snugly with the Feat canon.</p>&mdash; <b>Sam Sutherland</b>"

		"review": "<p>They don't come much more eccentric than Mark Gillespie. Best known for 1980 debut album Only Human, the one-time Melbourne singer-songwriter refused to play the music industry game. Instead of touring behind that record or giving interviews, he travelled through Asia. His genre-hopping songs, meanwhile, indulge in weird arrangements and dark, philosophical lyrics. Before turning to music, Gillespie had written short stories, co-founded the Aussie-centric Outback Press, and done a six-year architecture degree at Melbourne Uni. Today he lives in Bangladesh, where he works at an orphanage, writes songs in the jungle, and has penned a text-message novella called No Hope. Not your average troubadour, then.</p><p>Last year Aztec reissued Only Human as a two-disc package with comprehensive liner notes and Gillespie's offbeat commentary. Now comes the second entry in his four-album career. Although it doesn't quite have the anything-is-possible vibe of the first, Sweet Nothing (1981) keeps several of its players and again enlists producer John Sayers (Radio Birdman, John Williamson). Daddy Cool's Ross Hannaford, who was on board for Only Human, plays guitar on two songs, and there are backing singers, synths, and saxophone. Like Only Human, this is a fascinating combination of '70s singer-songwriter-isms and the now-cheesy production values of the early '80s.</p><p>But it's much more than that, too. While seeming innocuous enough, the title sums up the startling existential quandary of Gillespie's songs. Uplifting music is often paired with bleak themes as he rattles off the kind of lines you wouldn't expect to hear from a singer-songwriter even today. On the self-reflexive opener 'Nothing Special', Gillespie describes America's iconic Midnight Special train line as something that will deliver him to the promised land. Backing singers come in just after he sings, \"I think I hear the gospel band\", but by the time he announces, \"There's nothin' special in this world\", his optimism has drained away and he seems to be staring head-on into oblivion. The train becomes downright menacing, and Gillespie watches it roar past him with fear and hopelessness in his gut.</p><p>And that's all in the first track. Later, 'Swing Tonight' proves to be a burbling funk-pop number about suicide (\"We're all gonna swing tonight\") and 'Miss Right' darkly intones \"I know you're gonna be Miss Wrong.\" 'Night & Day' sees society robbing one's identity (\"They might give you all a number/You don't have a say\"), while 'Rivers of Blood' is as unsparing in its imagery as you'd expect from that title.<p><p>Amid all that pessimism, though, the music remains jaunty, twanging, and spiked with playful bass lines and harmonies. Despite warnings about seeking meaning in love and money, 'Traveller in the Night' strongly recalls the skeletal funk and underdog yearning of the Stones classic 'Beast of Burden'. Other tracks summon Cat Stevens, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, and 'Wild Night'-era Van Morrison, while 'Pile-Up' seems to lift a page from the art-school adventures of Talking Heads.<p><p>This re-mastered edition includes much briefer liner notes than Only Human and only two b-sides as bonus tracks: the barroom gospel of 'Passing' and the layered 'Looking for You'. That means it's still best to start with Only Human. It's also worth noting that three of these songs had rawer incarnations in 1978's demo batch The Black Tape, which was included with the Only Human reissue: a meditative eight-minute version of 'Nothing Special', a bluesier 'Stormy Night' with prominent female vocals, and a gospel-edged version of 'Miss Right' called 'Another Ms. Wrong'.<p><p>\"While seeming innocuous enough, the title sums up the startling existential quandary of Gillespie's songs.\"<p><p>At the time of its release, Sweet Nothing peaked in the top 10 on the Melbourne charts and in the top 30 nationally. And aversion to self-promotion aside, Gillespie appeared on Countdown and supported the likes of Rodriguez, Tom Waits, and Jackson Browne in his day. But he didn't want to be a star, as proven by his stubborn attitude, as well as his current line of work. Knowing how things turned out for him only enhances Sweet Nothing's recurrent theme of struggling to find one's place in an unforgiving life. On the near-psychedelic 'Hand to Hand', Gillespie doesn't mince words: \"But if there was some reason to live/Then there would be something to understand.\"<p><p>He's since found a reason to live, but he's left behind some bold artefacts from his days of peering into the void. At his best, Gillespie was an unflinching poet of lost souls, mixing doubtful messages of hope with resounding portraits of despair.<p><p><strong>&mdash;Doug Wallen</strong></p>"

Trained as an architect,  Gillespie’s songs were well crafted constructions that looked to older monuments the likes of Hendrix, Dylan and solid rock, rather than the new wave. An element of Dire Straits crept through in the hard strut of Shake It, while the acoustic prism of Mercury harks back to simple elements that made the country-tinged rock of The Eagles socompelling. The athletic prowl of Long & Strong and the slow triumph of Suicide Sister really bite home, demonstrating that great songwriting never goes out of fashion.</p><p>For Gillespie fans the meat in the sandwich is the bonus disc of compilation tracks, October 1978 Black Tape sessions and early singles that track the development towards the finished Only Human LP. Among these there’s a fantastic, organ-heavy version of SuicideSister and Savonarola. As with all Aztec releases the gatefold CD packaging is sumptuous and the sleevenotes informative – to the point of Gillespie detailing the construction (\"Key of G, open tuning E\") of his songs.</p>"

		"review": "<p>If there is a piece of music most associated with one performer, then surely it is Bach's Goldberg Variations, and Glenn Gould. Gould made the Goldberg Variations, and the Goldberg Variations certainly made Glenn Gould.</p><p>Gould had made his concert debut at age 16. Then, while known in Canada through his concert appearances, he burst onto the international stage with his first recording, the now-legendary 1955 version of the Goldberg Variations.</p><p>The young, headstrong Gould had completely rejected the common romantic interpretations of Bach as performed by Wanda Landowska. He brought an ice-down-the-back-of-the-shirt clarity to Bach's neglected keyboard masterpiece, and turned it into a best-seller, and himself into a star. In fact, the recording has never been out of print in the almost 50 years since it was recorded.</p><p>Landowska's famous statement to a pianist \"You play Bach your way, and I'll play him his way\" becomes ironic after you've heard Glenn Gould bring out every nuance of counterpoint in these works, revealing their full complexity. Glenn Gould's performances are usually described with words such as cold, crystalline, icey, sharp, intellectual, impeccable, eccentric and arrogant. Not all complimentary words. After hearing this version of the Goldbergs I must add to this list lighthearted, free, friendly, delicate, witty and fulfilling.</p><p>Bach's Goldberg Variations are one of those rare works in classical music that have instant appeal to beginners, but also a richness and complexity that gratifies the expert. The more you look, the more you find, and it is impossible to tire of them.</p><p>Tradition has it that Bach was commissioned by the insomniac Count Keyserlingk to write the pieces for his court musician Johann Gottlieb Goldberg to play to help him sleep. As Gould says in his liner notes to the 1955 recording, this is a charming story and difficult to disprove.</p><p>But there remains much scepticism: Goldberg was just 14 years old when it was published, and his keyboard skills may not have been adequate for the task, there is no dedication on the title page (as was customary), and there is no evidence of the golden chalice that Keyserlingk was supposed to have paid Bach for the music.</p><p>For those interested in Bach's almost mathematical structures, the Goldberg Variations will fascinate. The Aria, a Saraband, appears like two pillars at either end of the work. In between are 30 variations, grouped into 10 groups of three. Each set of 3 pieces is a free variation, a variation in duet and a canon. Thus every third piece is a canon, starting with a canon in unison (ie the canonic parts are in the same key) followed by ever increasing intervals until the 27th variation, a canon in ninth.</p><p>As a musical joke, the 30th variation is not a canon at all, but a quodlibet, music where two independent melodies are played together. Here Bach uses two low-brow folk melodies, \"I long have been away from you\" and \"Cabbage and turnips have driven me away, Had my mother cooked meat, I'd have chosen to stay\".</p><p>Glenn Gould The Goldbergs are a showpiece of keyboard virtuosity and variety. Glenn Gould brings out the flavours of them all. The pensive Aria, the cheeky 5th variation and the deeply introspective 25th Variation, that Landowska called the Black Pearl. And yes, if you turn the volume up, you can clearly hear Gould singing along, obviously enjoying himself.</p><p>As a final irony, Gould re-recorded the Goldbergs in 1981, despite rarely doubling up in recordings throughout his career. It was the same Gould, but a completely different set of Goldbergs. Slower (much slower), less fireworks but deeper and more meditative. He died from a massive stroke soon after, the two Goldberg Variation recordings pillars at each end of his creative life.</p>"

		"review": "<p>While Glenn Gould's 1955 debut recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations has attained legendary status, there are many devoted fans who rank the 1981 recording just as highly, even though it offers a dramatically different interpretation. This album was made shortly before the pianist's premature death at age 50, so it is significant for being his last recording; indeed, the opening measures of the Aria are carved on Gould's headstone, in final recognition of the work's importance to him, so these two recordings may be regarded as bookends to the pianist's extraordinary career. Gould's tempos are slower and more measured in the 1981 performance, and the observance of some repeats here also differs from the earlier version. On the whole, the 1981 performance is reflective and carefully considered, in contrast with the technical brilliance and impulsive energy of the first. Gould's background humming is common to both Goldbergs, and even though the technology existed at the time of this recording to remove it, Gould kept it in, for fear of losing the piano's full sound. This eccentricity may be off-putting to some listeners, but there are so many fine points in Gould's playing that it must be overlooked to appreciate the true value of his playing and his understanding of Bach, which is original by any standard. Columbia's reproduction is crisp and clear, in keeping with Gould's wishes.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Blair Sanderson</strong></p>"

For the hour duration of Soul Food Taqueria's mostly instrumental, sample-based, and Latin-tinged grooves, the only element that occasionally breaks up the very pleasant monotony of the tracks are the vocals. Lyrics Born, Gresham Taylor, and occasionally Guerrero himself all sing on the album, some to greater effect than others (e.g., Lyrics Born's \"Gettin' It Together\" is the standout track here, the sole hip-shaker among a gaggle of moodier pieces — the biggest inspiration for which seems to be the general street vibe of San Francisco's Mission district). And while Guerrero describes that scene pretty accurately with his music, on the whole Soul Food Taqueria fails to stick to the ribs because it simply lacks the proper spice.</p> &mdash; <b>Bryan Carroll</b>"

The album is a historic release in many ways. It reunites two blues legends who began their unique association in the 1950s. The album was recorded live in March 1993 at Buddy Guy's world-famous Chicago blues mecca Legends, and it's an acoustic document of many classic songs that made both Wells and Guy legends in their own right, such as \"She's Alright\" and \"I've Been There,\" along with other classic blues standards such as \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"Key to the Highway,\" all delivered with a looseness and power that define both Guy and Wells. It also marks the last time the two ever played together.</p>&mdash; <b>Matthew Greenwald</b>"

His first album for the label, Damn Right, I've Got the Blues, was a smash success, earning critical acclaim, awards, and sales hand over fist. Prior to that record, he was a legend only among blues fans; afterward, he was a star. Although it was a bit too rock-oriented and slick for purists, Damn Right was a terrific album, setting the pace not only for Guy but for modern electric blues in the '90s. As the decade wore on, Guy continued to make albums for Silvertone, some of them a little complacent, others quite excellent. Buddy's Baddest: The Best of Buddy Guy attempts to summarize those years in 14 songs, including three previously unreleased cuts. Not surprisingly, the compilers favor the Guy of Damn Right, featuring four songs from the record and three from its soundalike sequel, Feels Like Rain. Only two tracks from Slippin' In, his hardest blues record for the label, made the cut, while the fine live album Live! The Real Deal and the misguided Heavy Love are represented by a track apiece. In other words, a lot of good stuff remains on the original albums, which is doubly unfortunate since the three unreleased cuts are all throwaways. By relying so heavily on two records, Buddy's Baddest doesn't wind up being an accurate portrait of Guy's Silvertone recordings. That doesn't mean it's a bad listen, since the first ten songs are all very good and quite entertaining. However, anyone who has Damn Right but wants to dig deeper into Guy's Silvertone albums may prefer to pick up Feels Like Rain, which offers more of the same crossover Chicago blues, or Slippin' In, which is the real deal.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Here is a white guy, after all, who sounds like a black blues singer and chooses -- of his own free will -- to frequently return to the repertoire of an obscure black guitarist/singer from the 1930s. At the Crossroads collects this musical meeting of the minds -- or souls -- by gathering 14 of Hammond's Johnson covers, recorded between 1965 and 1978. Like Johnson, Hammond relies mostly on solo acoustic guitar. In this way, it's easy to certify his versions of \"Come on in My Kitchen\" and \"32-20 Blues\" as the real deal, or, as a folk enthusiast would say, \"authentic.\" At the same time, renditions of \"Milkcow's Calf Blues\" and \"Stones in My Passway\" are less raw and penetrating than Johnson's, and one could easily say that Hammond's real gift is that of a popularizer of rural acoustic blues. The last four cuts include full-band takes of \"Sweet Home Chicago,\" \"When You Got a Good Friend,\" \"Judgment Day,\" and \"Rambling Blues.\" While these cuts surely won't pass the purity test, they're nonetheless lots of fun. At the Crossroads is a cross-cultural, racial, and generational document, and offers a good one-stop look at one artist's nod toward another.</p>&mdash; <b>Ronnie D. Lankford Jr.</b>"

		"review": "<p>John Hammond, Jr. fell in love with country blues in the early '60s, and he has never shaken it out of his system. Over time he has developed into a gritty guitar and harp player, and while his voice still feels like someone imitating a rustic Southern blues singer rather than actually being one (Hammond is a lifetime New Yorker, after all), he has learned to temper the hoarse overstatement in his vocals to some degree -- or maybe, after 40-plus years of albums, listeners have just gotten used to his delivery. In Your Arms Again finds Hammond working in a trio format with bassist Marty Ballou and drummer Stephen Hodges, and the result is a wonderfully loose, anxious, and ragged roadhouse sound that continually feels like it's going to steamroll right off a cliff -- which isn't a bad thing at all. Recorded in a converted church in Salina, KS, in just five days, In Your Arms Again includes the usual Hammond mix of old blues and R&B classics, including, this time around, two Ray Charles songs (\"I've Got a Woman,\" \"Fool for You\"), three made famous by Howlin' Wolf (\"I'm Leavin' You,\" \"Moanin' for My Baby,\" and Willie Dixon's \"Evil [Is Going On]\"), a Jimmy Reed song (a sturdy, loping version of \"You Got Me Crying\"), and two of the album's highlights, a vicious take on John Lee Hooker's \"Serve Me Right to Suffer\" and a raggedly right shuffle try on Percy Mayfield's \"My Baby's Gone.\" Hammond also contributes two of his own songs, the title track and \"Come to Find Out,\" which are credible if unspectacular efforts. The best track here is arguably the opener, a delightfully loose and energetic romp through the traditional \"Jitterbug Swing,\" drawn, it would appear, from Bukka White's 1940 version on OKeh Records. In the end, Hammond doesn't break any new ground on In Your Arms Again, but the stripped-down trio format he uses here gives the album a nice back-porch rustic stomp feel, and if he stills seems like more of an imitator than an interpreter, well, he's going to get folks moving and shaking with this little combo, and that, first and foremost, is what the blues is supposed to do. The rest is academic.</p>&mdash; <b>Steve Leggett</b>"

Herbie Hancock performs a set of tunes which include numbers from the likes of Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder, Sade, Paul Simon, Prince, the Beatles (\"Norwegian Wood\") and Kurt Cobain. However by adding vamps, reharmonizing the chord structures, sometimes quickly discarding the melodies and utilizing an all-star band, Hancock was able to transform the potentially unrewarding music into creative jazz. Hancock, who sticks to acoustic piano, shows that he is still in prime form, taking quite a few fiery solos. With Michael Brecker on tenor and surprisingly effective soprano, guitarist John Scofield, bassist Dave Holland, drummer Jack DeJohnette and percussionist Don Alias (along with an occasional horn or string section that was dubbed in later), the results are often quite hard-swinging and certainly never predictable. Although it is doubtful that any of these songs will ever become a jazz standard, Herbie Hancock has successfully created a memorable set of \"new\" music. Well worth investigating.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

This neo-soul/jazz project showcases Erykah Badu, Common, D'Angelo, Marc Cary, and jam band icon saxophonist Karl Denson on a 14-track set that is laden with funk, groove, freestyle rap poetry, and sultry hip-hop/R&amp;B mood swings. Hargrove's interesting horn and keyboard improvisations stem from extensive knowledge of each musician's work and, perhaps even more importantly, from close personal friendships developed as an underground club jam session warrior in N.Y.C.</p><p>He also plays flügelhorn and percussion, and adds background vocals on several compositions. Opening with \"Hardgroove,\" the set eases into a groove that is skillfully combined with Hargrove's meticulous riffs and segues into the band's free interpretation of an all-out jam session. \"Common Free Style\" is just that, a free rap session crammed with intimate details. This team-up works, and Common's prose style is exemplary in his choice of words and inspiring atmosphere. As one of the ladies who sings with the band, Grammy-winning Erykah Badu presents a valuable addition to the literature of hip-hop and jazz on several levels. On \"Poetry,\" her rap is an entertaining and unpretentious chronicle of knowing the way to go in life, recounted with honesty and sincerity.</p><p>Overall, Roy Hargrove has evolved as a hipper version of himself and given his listeners an entirely new musical direction than that heard on his Grammy-winning release <I>Habana</I> or his sensuous ballad recording <I>Moment to Moment</I>. <I>Hard Groove</I> is simply an exploration of his multidimensional musical attributes and his belated recognition of years of \"open-eared moonlighting.\" In any case, the ultra-hip trumpeter manages not to alienate his die-hard jazz fans by intersecting with many of the icons of hip-hop, R&amp;B, and neo-soul.

He and his band, the Innocent Criminals, travel around the world playing nearly 200 shows a year; therefore, it was only a matter of time before this guitar virtuoso made a live album. <i>Live From Mars</i>, an enigmatic two-disc set of 25 songs, celebrates the rise of Harper, his incredible live presence between 1998 and 2000, and the appreciation between him and his audience. His fragile acoustics have been thrown into a massive guitar storm on disc one, a thunderous combination of his signature folky blues-funk rock & roll. He's soulful and approachable on \"Excuse Me Mr.\" and \"Burn One Down,\" but he reaches for something tangible on Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing.\" The vibe is calm and cool while Harper's vocals scale between a sweet falsetto and a rugged twang. \"Faded\" exudes Harper's electric twitching, and its perfection swaggers into a riveting cover of Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" for a near ten-minute car crash of pure rollicking.</p><p>He switches from his electric to an acoustic for disc two, making his informality even more enticing. \"Waiting on an Angel\" is delicate, similar to the likes of Jeff Buckley, but it's the beauty of the Verve's \"The Drugs Don't Work\" that truly captures the standard of excellence that Harper depicts as a performer. Acoustically, he's honored and such praise is deserved. He's practically flawless. He's a modest artist, and such humility is found among his songs. He's achieved respectability with his fans that only so many artists are able to attain. <i>Live From Mars</i> is a proper release and certainly an inviting look into Harper and the showmanship he projects while spending time on the road.</p>&mdash; <b>MacKenzie Wilson </b>"

If his first two albums &mdash;<i>Welcome to the Cruel World</i> and <i>Fight for Your Mind</i> &mdash;didn't clue you in, <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> will definitely do so. Diamonds on the Inside marks Harper's fifth studio effort and this time he's emotionally in touch with what makes his heart burst. This is a passionate album, no doubt. His signature Weissenborn guitar joins him once more and Harper's classic groovy funk is heavy; however, Harper adds worldbeat to his musical plank. From the Marley-esque vibe of \"With My Own Two Hands\" to the African soundscapes of Ladysmith Black Mambazo on \"Picture of Jesus,\" Harper's purist presentation is smooth. \"When It's Good\" gives a little country blues twang, while \"Touch From You Lust\" is a sexy haze of writhing riffs. \"Temporary Remedy\" follows the funk Lenny Kravitz-style, and Harper's a bit campy. It's a noticeable change from his typically serious stature and a nice shift in personality, too. <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> is another stunning effort from one of rock's underground heroes. Harper has consistently worked with what appeals to him musically for nearly a decade, ignoring what fits the mainstream. <i>Diamonds on the Inside</i> is Harper's sixth chapter of truth and just one listen to the electric blaze of \"Everything\" will convince you.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>MacKenzie Wilson</strong></p><hr/><p>In Pleasure and Pain, Danny Clinch's documentary of Ben Harper's 2001 Burn to Shine tour, Harper is caught throwing a cute-if-cantankerous fit on camera, whining and snapping at a European journalist like a pot-smoking Thom Yorke. It's funny, but not especially surprising that when faced with a middling reporter, Harper found his knickers in a bit of a twist: he's been misunderstood by the mainstream music press for nearly a decade now, and bumbling critics are at least partially to blame for the sloppily cobbled together batch of tracks on his latest studio release, the scattered Diamonds on the Inside.</p><p>Since his 1993 debut, Ben Harper has been getting all tangled up in his influences&mdash;he's inadvertently hog-tied himself with big, fat superstar ropes, each woven from stringy bits of Hendrix, Redding, Marley, Plant, Page, and a few stray Dylan hairs. This is as much a product of a lazy press (who relentlessly&mdash;aw, shit!&mdash;point out and examine his many muses) as it is his own musical mishmash, but either way it's got Harper stuck and wiggling for release. Disparate inspiration isn't a problem on its own, but Harper's inability to stabilize and carve himself a personality sure is. Neo-blues-soul-metal-punk-reggae-gospel-rock-funk is far too cumbersome to be a proper qualifier, and Diamonds on the Inside's breathless Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock whirlwind is tiring, at best. Harper's now-trademark lack of focus&mdash;which is especially disappointing because dude's got skills with that slide!&mdash;is destined to forever supercede his considerable songwriting talent.</p><p>Diamonds on the Inside opens with its first single, \"With My Own Two Hands\", an optimistic and aggressively reggae-inspired bit of dancehall wah-wah, complete with Hammond B3, clavinet, and high, lazy backing vocals. Harper swings effortlessly from a low, throaty growl to his excellent soul falsetto, and the rich, dynamic percussion (Oliver Francis Charles on drums) works remarkably well here. It's what happens next that gives pause: the sparse, southern gospel romp \"When It's Good\" stars a completely different breed of Harper, blues-driven and virtually unaccompanied (save a box of rocks, some background singers, and his acoustic slide).</p><p>Meanwhile, the title track is a thick, sentimental Lynyrd Skynyrd guitar throwdown, featuring a singalong chorus and sweet, lilting pedal steel, electric piano, bass, and guitars; the aptly titled \"Bring the Funk\" is pure gimmick, all synthesizers and poorly channeled Parliament. \"So High So Low\" is heavy, Zeppelin-inspired metal thrashing, kick-started by some kind of otherworldly primal scream. And on and on: slices of this and chunks of that. Slow down, Harps, I'm getting freakin' confused! What kind of goulash you serving here, anyway?</p><p>Despite Diamonds on the Inside's pointed identity crisis, there are still some standout songs. Ladysmith Black Mambazo pop up on the vocals-only \"Picture of Jesus\", which, despite its heavy-handed religious meditations, is a textured, vigorous, and engaging contemporary hymn. The brisk and solo-friendly \"Touch from Your Lust\" (seriously, what does that mean?) would have fit nicely on Burn to Shine, with its Lenny Kravitz bellbottom howls and heavy electric guitar noodling.</p><p>Harper has never been a particularly keen lyricist, but the introductory line of \"When She Believes\" (\"The good Lord is such a good Lord/ With such a good Mother, too\") is especially ridiculous, and the \"Behind all of your tears/ There's a smile/ Behind all of the rain/ There's a sunshine for miles and miles\" of \"Everything\" seems equally uninspired. To the contrary, new-favorite-word \"shuck\" is employed superbly in \"Bring the Funk\" (\"Some are jiving/ Some are shuck/ Some are just down on their luck\").</p><p>To his immense credit, Ben Harper pulls off rock star posturing even though he sits in a chair while playing live (an achievement Jagger has not yet approached&mdash;maybe this explains the incessant arena-touring?), and his performances are always charismatic affairs, especially if you're okay with little kids dancing shirtless outside. It's onstage that Harper excels, his humble grace and organic porch singing somehow capable of tugging sunburned college students away from the falafel tent and back to the main stage; live, his scattered influences are far less distracting and his playing takes on a more even and consistent edge.</p><p>Other artists have played the don't-pigeonhole-me card with slightly more success&mdash;Beck unapologetically flits between genres and styles, but has enough sense (or enough handlers) to centralize his records in a way that makes them thematically comprehensible. Even when artists self-consciously draw from a long, complicated lineage of diverse sounds and tactics, there still needs to be an organizing principle; ideally, individual tracks should contribute something substantial to the greater whole, like a chapter in a novel or a stanza in a poem, each cohesive, directed, and pushing towards a narrative payoff. All fourteen tracks here are autonomous, but as a record, Diamonds on the Inside feels pretty empty.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This album began as a series of rehearsals for collaboration on a Blind Boys of Alabama record. Recorded in two sessions, the vibe in the room was loose and creative enough that the two acts ended up with an album of collaborative material for joint release. And this is a collaboration in the truest sense of the word. It's not just Ben playing gospel, or the Blind Boys of Alabama singing on a Ben Harper record. These ten tunes -- with seven Harper originals written specifically for the sessions, the rest traditional gospel tunes and covers -- showcase Harper and the Innocent Criminals alongside the Blind Boys of Alabama.</p><p>The album kicks off with Harper's \"Take My Hand,\" a funky gospel tune that showcases a Fender Rhodes and Harper's wah-wah pedal underscored by the call and response of the Blind Boys repeating the title after each sung line of the verse, before Clarence Fountain takes it out. \"Wicked Man\" is a Southern soul tune that has a Muscle Shoals groove and a beautiful vocal weave on the refrain. \"Church House Steps\" is pure gospel groove with a Hammond B3 and a smoking duet between the Blind Boys' layered harmonies and Harper on the verses with full-on blues feel in his singing and playing. There's a killer cover of the Bob Dylan/Danny O'Keefe tune, \"Well, Well, Well,\" with Delta blues bottleneck shimmering through the intertwined vocal lines. The deep, nocturnal sparseness of \"Satisfied Mind\" is a complete re-reading of the nugget with a swampy backbeat. And this album works beautifully. Nothing sounds forced, all of it loose and comfortable and the vocal performances on both sides are simply stellar. Highly recommended.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>After seven albums and 12 years in the game, it can stop being said that Ben Harper is hard to categorize, because at this point, the fact that he always incorporates diverse elements — from folk to hard rock to funk — into his music and makes something very much his own is a given. He's practically created a genre. So maybe that's why it's so surprising that Both Sides of the Gun, a two-disc album, has little of that very thing that makes him so unique. Instead, he chooses to show off the range of his musical interests, and ends up with something closer to a compilation than a Ben Harper album.<p><p>The softer, acoustically based disc is full of pretty love songs and sweetly strummed guitars, and though Harper has done this before and kept his own style intact (in \"Two Hands of a Prayer\" and \"When She Believes,\" for example), here he comes off sounding a bit boring. He hasn't forgotten himself completely: both \"Never Leave Lonely Alone\" and \"Crying Won't Help You Now\" are good songs, sounding strongly of him while also experimenting with other styles (Latin/French and gospel, respectively), but almost all the other tracks could have been pulled off any run-of-the-mill singer/songwriter album from the past ten years. Things improve slightly on the other, louder, disc (\"Please Don't Talk About Murder While I'm Eating\" is all electric blues, complete with a distorted slide guitar solo, and \"Serve Your Soul\" is the most Harper-ish of everything, blending folk guitar, pure rock, raw blues, and socially conscious lyrics into one eight-minute masterpiece), but there's still that sampler-record feeling there. \"Engraved Invitation\" and \"Get It Like You Like It\" are heavily influenced by the Rolling Stones, \"Both Sides of the Gun\" alludes to Curtis Mayfield and James Brown, and \"Better Way\" is practically a tribute (at least musically) to Prince's \"7.\" Harper has always borrowed from other artists, but he's also always added enough of himself to make it not quite so...blatant. It's not that he isn't able to perform such a diverse selection: there are plenty of excellent cuts and most of the album is quite good.</p><p>Harper is a fantastically talented musician, and he has really developed his voice since Diamonds on the Inside and is unafraid to do things with it, going from a croon to a scream and always sounding great. But why he's copying other people's styles instead of building on his own is both odd and disappointing, because he's always been able to experiment before while also preserving his individuality. If in Both Sides of the Gun Harper is trying to show his audience what a wide variety of music he can cover, he certainly accomplishes that. But if he's trying to create an album that is really about him, he doesn't quite deliver. Ben Harper is in there, don't worry, but he can be a little hard to find.</p>"

		"review": "<p>As it's played out on his recordings, the very gift that has been such a boon to Ben Harper has also been his bane: his musical restlessness and the wide range of styles he seems to employ. It's obvious, and has been since his sophomore offering, Fight for Your Mind, that Harper is not only a master guitarist but a fine songwriter and a great showman. He's been under the sway of legends like Marley, Hendrix, Dylan, Redding, and to a lesser extent, Havens. On his recordings he's wrapped them all up together continually, creating an identity forged on that diversity. That said, as a result, the albums have often suffered. In a live context that shape-shifting mélange can be &mdash; and more often than not is &mdash; seamless and utterly exciting. In the studio it doesn't gel so easily. His last studio record, Both Sides of the Gun in 2006, attempted a narrower, albeit mellower focus; but he spread it over two discs! The desire to concentrate on a single identity &mdash; as a singer/songwriter &mdash; resulted in a less than optimal, sometimes even boring, result; a single disc would have been more easily swallowed. Perhaps this is why his most satisfying and consistent offering is arguably his collaboration with the Blind Boys of Alabama on There Will Be a Light from 2004 &mdash; until now. Ben Harper &amp; the Innocent Criminals entered Gang Studio in Paris in November of 2006, immediately after finishing a nine-month world tour that ended with eight weeks in Europe. They loaded in their gear, rehearsed, and recorded directly to analog tape &mdash; i.e., without the aid of computers or Pro Tools &mdash; and mixed in seven days. The result is a deeply focused, loose, and laid-back record that is musically compelling and deeply soulful, and contains some of Harper's finest songs to date. At this time, the Innocent Criminals are drummer Oliver Charles, percussionist Leon Mobley, Juan Nelson on bass, guitarist Michael Ward, and Jason Yates plays keyboards, with a pair of backing vocalists, Michelle Haynes and Rovleta Fraser. Clocking in at just over 40 minutes, this is a brief record for Harper, but it serves him well. The music is a seamless meld of soulful folk, gospel, countryish rock, and blues. The operative genre here, however, is the rootsy soul that Harper could always sing, and Ward's fills along with the electric Wurlitzer, acoustic pianos, and Hammond B-3 employed by Yates make it all swing, while the steady yet slippery percussion roots the music deeply in the groove, which is mellow but tough.</p><p>The proof begins on \"Fight Outta You,\" the album's opening track. Harper's acoustic plays the first couple of bars before the rest of the band kicks in, establishing a country-soul feel. His lyrics are uplifting, full of determination and hope. This is underscored by the next number, \"In the Colors,\" which bleeds Southern soul and a killer reggae bassline bubbling underneath. The theme of hope is right there, propping the first track by underscoring in poetic terms the true, just, and beautiful. \"Fool for a Lonesome Train,\" a backwoods country-rock tune, is maybe the strongest cut on the set; its high lonesome sound is borne out not just in the grain of Harper's vocal but by the band's unobtrusive yet utterly engaging support. The lyrics are there; they have the wild and restless in them but it takes a group effort to make restraint an art, underscoring the blood and sinew in Harper's words. That's not to say there are no \"rockers\" on the set. \"Needed You Tonight\" comes right out of the shouting gospel and electric blues with electric guitars blazing; it alternates its dynamic between that vibe and sweet soul. \"Having Wings\" is a gorgeous follow-up, with acoustic piano and electric guitars flowing under Harper's voice.</p><p>\"Say You Will\" is a seriously uptempo gospel shouter, but far more carnal. It's an ass-shaker with smoking piano and percussion work and lots of breakbeats tossed in by Charles; that backing chorus takes it out of Sunday morning and places it in the heart of Saturday night. \"Put It on Me\" is more of a guitar take on the same kind of music. With the chorus and those six-strings all edgy and loose, it's funky, dirty, and gets very close to nasty. \"Heart of Matters\" gets back to back-porch soul before giving way to a Weissenborn guitar solo on \"Paris Sunrise #7,\" before closing with the lone acoustic guitar and vocal ballad on the title cut. The set could have gone out on one of the more uptempo tunes after the instrumental, but it's a small complaint in this mix. Whether or not you prefer the rowdier version of Harper and his band, it is inarguable that this recording is a concentrated effort coming down on the side of a couple of musical notions that weave together artfully and meaningfully. This is a very informal-sounding record, and one that feels comfortable in showing its unvarnished side, its seams. And given that it was recorded completely in analog, fans would be well advised to pick up vinyl copies as well and compare the two; the prediction is most likely the vinyl sounds fuller and warmer.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>While it's always been true that Ben Harper has been a musically restless soul with a penchant for changing up his groove from album to album, most of them have been recorded with his longtime unit the Innocent Criminals. As a result, both live and in the studio, a particular vibe existed. Familiarity breeds that, and it also sets up a dynamic. For White Lies for Dark Times, Harper put the Innocent Criminals on hiatus and hooked up with a new group: three Austin, TX transplants to Los Angeles called Relentless7, comprised of guitarist Jason Mozersky, bassist Jesse Ingalls, and drummer Jordan Richardson. The end result is, to say the least, explosive. While it's true that this 11-track collection does have some beautiful acoustic balladry on it, and a touch of Harper's brand of soul in its grooves, most of what we find here is balls out Rock with a potent dose of ragged, modern Texas blues thrown in. Indeed this may be the most electric sounding recording Harper has ever issued. He co-wrote six of the tracks with his bandmates, and those he wrote himself have been arranged and/or written to be played with this band. It's in the mix from the opener, \"Number with No Name,\" the slow slide guitar playing an electric blues stomp that's pure Harper, but the drums are pure thud and whomp rather than snap and crackle. The bassline is enormous and the second guitar matches both volume and nastiness with that slide. In other words, this sounds like a band playing this jam, not Harper and his band. One can hear traces of Jimi Hendrix, early ZZ Top, and Johnny Winter in the attack, but it's pure rocking blues thunder and lightning spit out via Texas and the Delta.</p><p>The more spacy rock of \"Up to You Now\" is more directly a \"Harper\" tune with its stretched rhythmic sense and soulful vocal, but the utterly popping bass and wooly distorted guitar mix move it beyond his sensitive singer/songwriter frame. \"Shimmer & Shine,\" the set's first single, begins as a double-timed rocker with Richarsdon's drum break, but kicks in with a staggered set of power chords that blend angsty punk and anthemic rock. \"Why Must You Always Dress in Black\" is pure blues-rock venom, the overdriven distortion (engineer and co-producer Danny Kalb did a brilliant job on this set, and on this track in particular) makes the guitars sound like they're breathing fire. The scattershot breaks from Richardson are impressive, especially as underscored with a syncopated bass pattern that marries blues, rock, and funk by Ingalls. Harper's slide chops -- especially when matched against that screaming blues riff of Mozersky's -- marks the toughest cut on the set. And that's saying something, because there isn't a throwaway here. Whether it's the shimmering, gospel-tinged balladry of \"Skin Thin,\" the crunchy wah-wah electric funk-rock of \"Keep It Together (So I Can Fall Apart),\" the tripped out voodoo-psych, percussion-driven skronk that is \"Boots Like These,\" or the straight up gorgeous, midtempo soul-rock ballad \"Faithfully Remain,\" that closes the set on an uplifting (if reserved) note; it's all inspired and executed flawlessly. And while it's true that many of the tunes have lyrics that reflect anger, disillusionment, and sometimes bitterness, the snarling yet joyous attack in the music balances them. This is the record that finally matches the excitement Harper generates in a live setting and is not to be missed.</p><strong>&mdash; Thom Jurek</strong>"

		"review": "<p>After the sidestep trio with Dhani Harrison and Joseph Arthur in A Fistful of Mercy, a trio that netted the all-too-sleepy As I Call You Down, guitar hero Ben Harper reconvenes his Relentless7 bandmates -- Jason Mozersky, guitar; Jesse Ingalls, bass and keys; and Jordan Richardson, drums -- for Give Till It's Gone. The 11-song set runs the gamut of Harper's many styles. There are midtempo rockers such as the intimate first-person confessional \"Don't Give Up on Me Now,\" which examines the distance between what a man aspires to be and what he actually is. The title of \"I Will Not Be Broken\" may be anthemic, but the song is a moody -- bordering on angry -- minor-key waltz that melds acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards, and muffled percussion in an atmospheric blanket. Harper gets his volume on in the lyrically mindless but harder psych rock of \"Rock n' Roll Is Free.\" While he claims the song was inspired by Neil Young, it doesn't live up to his muse's reckless knife-edged example. Ringo Starr makes two appearances here, as co-writer and drummer on the over-produced Beatlesque \"Spilling Faith,\" which gives way to a much more interesting instrumental addendum called \"Get There from Here,\" allowing the Relentless7, Harper, and Starr to really cut loose and play. It's dissonant, ragged and woolly, and drenched in noisy, blown-out production. Harper's moving \"Pray That Our Love Sees the Dawn\" is a midtempo ballad that features Jackson Browne's inimitable harmony vocals, adding the necessary depth to a lyric that reveals the aforementioned distance between the man in the mirror and the one looking at him. Harper allows his soul groove voice in \"Waiting on a Sign,\" which in turn gives way to the screaming '90s-centric funk-rock of \"Dirty Little Lover,\" with slide guitars ablaze. He's best in the louder numbers mentioned above, the stomping dissonant syncopation in \"Clearly Severely,\" and \"Do It for You, Do It for Us.\" The latter is the album's closing track; it walks a stiletto's edge between melodic psychedelia and stomping heavy rock. While nowhere near as focused as 2009's White Lies for Dark Times, Give Till It's Gone does possess moments when all of Harper's gifts as a writer and guitarist are evidently clear.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p><i>All Things Must Pass</i> has long been one of the more vexing classic albums to make it to CD. It appeared previously in two distinctly different (yet confusingly similar) packagings in the late '80s, one from England and one from America, both of which were straight reissues of the original triple LP. Neither was a wholly satisfactory release, owing to the same problems that existed on Layla by Derek & the Dominos — both albums (which have related histories) were recorded using lots of tracks (and no noise reduction technology) to achieve a very big sound, which was impressive on vinyl but had a lot of noise when processed digitally for CD. This expanded and remastered edition, released in January of 2001, solved most of those problems as well as offering five additional tracks. The remastering, done sometime in 2000, has imparted greater resolution to the music without losing the wall-of-sound effect that most of the album was intended to display. In the process, it's possible to discern the various guitars at work far better than on the original LP set, and to better appreciate the virtuosity of the playing involved as well as the sheer size of the ensemble Harrison assembled. Additionally, and almost more important in terms of enjoying the album as a whole, the new edition captures the warmth and nuances of Harrison's singing on songs like \"Let It Down,\" \"Run of the Mill,\" and \"Isn't It a Pity (Version Two).\" This improvement isn't reflected everywhere — on \"The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp,\" for example, his voice is still buried fairly deep in the mix and not as up front as it is elsewhere, but that's how it was mastered originally, and even Harrison admits, in the notes introducing the accompanying booklet, that he had to resist the urge to remix the album.</p><p>Of the five bonus tracks, one is an entirely new song from the original sessions, and three more are outtakes of existing songs in versions that have appeared on various bootlegs, while \"My Sweet Lord (2000)\" is a stripped-down reconsideration of the song. It doesn't add anything in particular, except to show that Harrison can still play up a storm. The so-called \"Apple Jam\" tracks that comprised disc three of the original LP have also been remastered, to their considerable advantage — the nuances of the playing on those sessions, which essentially marked the birth of Derek & the Dominos, are brought out in crisp detail and they are worth hearing, now more than ever, and that goes double for the hard-rocking, Chuck Berry-esque jam \"Thanks for the Pepperoni.\" The new edition comes in a box with each CD in a separate slipcase and a booklet containing photos from the original sessions, full lyrics, recording credits, and an essay by Harrison.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p><hr/><p>In 1970, the year the Beatles officially called it quits, divorce was on the American mind. One year earlier, California then-Governor Ronald Reagan had signed the nation's first no-fault divorce law, freeing couples from the burden of having to produce evidence of wrongdoing in order to legalize their separation. From 1965 to 1970, the number of divorce filings nearly doubled, and in the wake of similar laws pending in other states, the rate would surge through the beginning of the next decade. By the time Kramer Vs. Kramer won Best Picture in 1980, the number of divorces had nearly doubled again. But 1970 remains a mysterious fulcrum point: Whenever a new study is issued on separation rates, our progress or regression is always measured \"since 1970.\"</p><p>Like everything else the Beatles did, their dissolution in that year invented a new way for a band to be&mdash;in this case, painfully and publicly splintered. In their death throes, the group would become rock music's proxy divorcees for the ensuing decade. Just as there had been a Fab Four Beatle for every adolescent discovering the giddy thrills of rock and roll in the ‘60s, there was a divorced Beatle for every teenager caught between screaming parents in the ‘70s. The solo albums appeared immediately, like bruises on a wound, and each had the quality of argument brought to a deposition, a side of a story argued. Paul hightailed it off into new love and a second round at domesticity; John gazed into the ugliest parts of himself and wailed; Ringo retreated into the schmaltzy pre-rock 'n' roll standards of his youth.</p><p>And then there was George, who exhaled deeply, stretched, and flourished. \"I had such a lot of songs mounting up that I really wanted to do, but I only got my quota of one or two tunes per album,\" he said mildly on the Dick Cavett Show in 1971, referring to the increasingly tense time, from The White Album through the troubled Let It Be and Abbey Road, when each of the three main songwriters in the band had grown so attached to their individual visions that they began to see others in the room as obstacles. \"Over the last year or so, we worked something out which was still a joke, really,\" he told Howard Smith a year before. \"Three songs for me; three songs for Paul; three songs for John, and two for Ringo!\" The last official Beatles recording sessions, for the album Let It Be, were on January 3rd and 4th of 1970; John was not even present, vacationing with Yoko Ono in Denmark. Fittingly for a band that had become so consumed by conflict, the last Beatles song committed to tape was \"I, Me, Mine\"; even more fittingly, it was a George Harrison song.</p><p>Given his own studio, his own canvas, and his own space, Harrison did what no other solo Beatle did: He changed the terms of what an album could be. Rock historians mark* All Things Must Pass* as the first \"true\" triple album in rock history, meaning three LPs of original, unreleased material; the Woodstock concert LP, released six months before, is its only only spoiler antecedent. But in the cultural imagination, it is the first triple album, the first one released as a pointed statement. With its grave, formidable spine, it's symbolically freighted photo of Harrison in the country, pointedly surrounded by three toppled garden gnomes, it still sits like a leather-bound book, a pop-music King James Bible on any shelf of records it occupies. It is one of the first such objects in pop music history, the unwieldy triple album that spilled out oceans of black vinyl, printed thousands of sheets of lyrics, traversed multiple sides and made you get up and sit back down again five times, walking half a mile between your couch and your stereo to experience it all. It was the heaviest and the most consequential Beatles solo album, the first object from the Beatles fallout to plummet from the sky and land with a clunk in a generation of living rooms. It is a paean to having too much ambition, too much to say, to fit into a confined space, and for this reason alone it remains one of the most important capital-A Albums of all time.</p><p>It was also massively popular, despite its hefty retail tag; All Things Must Pass spent seven weeks at No. 1, and its' lead single, \"My Sweet Lord,\" occupied the same slot on the singles chart, marking the first time a solo Beatle had occupied both spots. The success was sweet vindication for Harrison; his triumph was so resounding that his former partners could not pretend to ignore it. \"Every time I turn on the radio, it's ‘Oh my lord,'\" John Lennon joked dryly to Rolling Stone. Rumors have it that John and Paul reacted with chagrin at hearing the bounty of material spilling forth on the album, finally grasping the depth of talent they had been slow to recognize. Their solo albums would be considered successes to various degrees, in their own ways, but only George had the wind of true surprise at his back.</p><p>All Things Must Pass had the quality of a broken-off conversation picked up years later; there were gorgeous songs here that Harrison had brought to the group, only to be met with to varying degrees of indifference. \"Isn't It a Pity\" had been rejected from Revolver, while \"All Things Must Pass\" was passed over for Abbey Road. In hindsight, it is impossible to imagine these songs having half the impact if they had appeared sandwiched between, say, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road.\" Taken together, they have their own cumulative weight and depth; you can even imagine their demos perhaps sounding too patient or too plodding to the other three. Reviewing it in* Rolling Stone *at the time, Ben Gerson compared it to the Germanic Romanticism of Bruckner or Wagner, composers who were unafraid of risking a little ponderousness to reach grandiose heights. Harrison might have been nursing resentments, but his former bandmates did him a perverse favor by leaving him with this material: This is music of contented solitude, and it only makes sense by itself.</p><p>Besides John, George was the only Beatle unafraid of writing from anger or negativity&mdash;his early Beatles tunes, like \"Think For Yourself\" and \"Taxman\" are almost startling in their bile. But where John thrashed and sometimes wallowed, George gently explored; when John Lennon pounded his fist, hollering that he was \"sick and tired of hearing things from uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites,\" George simply noted it was a \"pity\" that \"not too many people/ Can see we're all the same.\" The biting \"Wah-Wah,\" produced by Phil Spector and layered with so many different guitar tracks it feels like three guitar rock songs fighting each other, is possibly Harrison's most pointed missive as a solo artist, addressed to his increasingly alienated former bandmates. But even here he seems more bemused than pissed-off; the swoop and dip of the melodies and antic main riff resemble chuckling rather than shouting, and the most resonant lyric (\"And I know how sweet life can be/ If I keep myself free\") is the sound of a tentative soul allowing himself a measured yawp of freedom, however provisional and careful.</p><p>Harrison's music from this era embraced the Eastern philosophy that he had discovered studying with the Maharishi and would diligently follow throughout the ‘70s. When asked about these ideas in interviews, he could come off in print like a somewhat-tiresome scold, and his Beatles-era explorations in mysticism sometimes had a student's overcompensating sternness. But All Things Must Pass, though it is easily the most spiritual statement by any Beatle, is a wiser work, made by someone whose hard ideas have been softened and tenderized by a series of salutary body blows. There's a song called \"Let It Down\" and a song subtitled \"(Let It Roll)\"&mdash;simple expressions of surrender from someone who's learned exactly what they do and don't control. The title track turned on a phrase that sounded as much like \"It's not always gonna be this grey\" as it did \"it's not always gonna be this great\"; both interpretations are equally valid (even though the actual lyric is \"grey\"). \"It's time to start smiling/What else should we do?\" he inquired on the shimmering country-rock of \"Behind That Locked Door.\"</p><p>And, of course, there was \"My Sweet Lord\", the song that, purposefully or not, followed directly in the footsteps of The Chiffon's \"He's So Fine.\" Harrison was eventually sued for what a judge called \"unconscious plagiarism,\" which could be a good euphemism for \"pop songwriting.\" The situation was doubly ironic considering Harrison's intrinsic generosity as an artist. The album was a collaborative party in itself, a gathering in which Eric Clapton, Ringo, Billy Preston, future Yes drummer Alan White, and even a young Phil Collins, playing bongos on \"Art of Dying,\" were given space. Having been elbowed out of a room too many times before, it seemed, he was staunchly unwilling to do the same to others.</p><p>John and Paul were their songs, and you couldn't cover them without invoking some sort of impression of them. George's songs had room for others&mdash;other interpretations, other viewpoints, other voices. It's fitting that he invokes Dylan twice on All Things Must Pass&mdash;first on \"I'd Have You Anytime,\" co-written with Dylan, and \"If Not For You,\"  which Dylan himself included on New Morning. Like Dylan, Harrison saw songs like common goods, favors to be traded or plates to be shared. You could always visit George's songbook, like a village well, and bend it towards whatever personal ends you needed. He'd have you anytime.</p><p>Several generations  have taken him up on his implicit invitation, as his best songs go from artist to artist&mdash;Britt Daniel and Jim James; David Bowie and Dave Davies. Elliott Smith would arguably never have written a single song on Either/Or or XO without this music. The Beatles obsession of late-‘90s indie rock&mdash;the Elephant 6 bands, Guided by Voices&mdash;and the Britpop bands Oasis and Blur were channeling George as often as anything. Soul and jazz artists were drawn by the clean profundity of his simple lyrics and his languorous melodies; Nina Simone's 11-minute version of \"Isn't It a Pity\" turns the song into a small dead planet with herself as the only inhabitant, and she brought \"My Sweet Lord\" into the black church; James Brown's \"Something\" drenches the humble love note in anguished sweat. Ella Fitzgerald took the tricky rhythms of \"Savoy Truffle\" for a jazzy spin.</p><p>As for the third disc, called Apple Jam; it doesn't exactly yield new revelations with time. No one's ever listened to the stuff clogging up the back half of the last side, just like no one remembers what they said at last call and wishes they'd left the bar an hour earlier the next day&mdash;\"Plug Me In\" and \"I Remember Jeep\" and \"Thanks for the Pepperoni\" are the sound of a contented artist happily forgetting you are there. Harrison arguably knew exactly what he was doing with this last slab of vinyl; there has to be a reason you don't encounter \"Thanks For the Pepperoni\" sandwiched in between \"Isn't It a Pity\" and \"What Is Life.\" If you stick around for this party, it's because you know exactly what you're getting; they are the deluxe cuts and alternate takes of their day.  Even those little pieces and scraps have a role to play in* All Things'* inheritance to future generations, for better and for worse: When The Clash filled up the third LP of Sandinista! with children's versions of their best-known songs, there was only one precedent to reach for.</p><p>Sometimes, it seems as if the Beatles invented everything worth knowing about pop recordings. The process of making them, the process of venerating them, the idea that albums could be Ahab-like pursuits swallowing their creators nearly whole: We carry these notions in our heads because the Beatles put them there. With its sheer size and heft and gravitational pull, All Things Must Pass reinforced that the album could be an epic novel for a different sort of age. Today, \"albums\" exist largely as ideas rather than objects, shadow puppets we throw up against the wall to remind ourselves of the forms they represent. The language of physical media still haunts our vocabulary. Streaming services debut playlists that get dubbed \"mixtapes\"; we pull music from the available air and pipe them through our phones like water from a tap, and we still call use quaint words like \"LP\" and \"EP\" to describe them. For that legacy, we have artifacts like All Things Must Pass to thank. Today, albums like this are a bit like old ruins: They are important to keep around, even if they mostly remind us of what has changed. This dichotomy is the kind of thing that Harrison, who exited the earth in 2001, would probably have appreciated. All Things Must Pass is a monument to impermanence that has never once, even for a moment, left us.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Jayson Greene, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>George Harrison went quiet not long after the second Traveling Wilburys album, surfacing only for the Beatles' <I>Anthology</I> in the mid-'90s. He was recording all the while, yet he died before completing the album that would have been the follow-up to 1987's <I>Cloud Nine</I>. His son, Dhani, and his longtime friend/collaborator Jeff Lynne completed the recordings, released late in 2002, nearly a year after George's death, as <I>Brainwashed</I>. Given its baggage it's easy to be suspicious about the merits of <I>Brainwashed</I> prior to hearing it. Posthumous efforts often feel incomplete, Harrison's albums were frequently inconsistent, and Lynne favors ornate, cinematic productions that run contrary to George's desire for this project to be simple and low key &mdash; nothing that would suggest that <I>Brainwashed</I> would be a success.</p><p> Defying all odds, <I>Brainwashed</I> isn't just a success, it's one of the finest records Harrison ever made. Yes, it doesn't achieve the splendor of <I>All Things Must Pass</I>, nor is it quite of its time like both <I>Living in the Material World</I> and <I>Cloud Nine</I> were, but it's a quiet, subtle gem, one that strikes close to the heart of Harrison's music. It's intimate, alternately insightful and cheerfully lightweight, balancing his trademark black humor with silliness and good humor. Anyone searching the album for his views on mortality &mdash; as he faced not only cancer, but an attacker that nearly took his life &mdash; will surely find it, but this is not a somber album, it is a warm album, the sound of someone enjoying life without losing his wry sense of humor. This same spirit carries over to the music, with Harrison abandoning the idea of getting a hit and simply relaxing, primarily by playing a lot of ukulele and guitar. There aren't any major songs here and perhaps a tune or two could be pegged as throwaways by the cynical, but there are no down moments and it all holds together well &mdash; better than most Harrison albums &mdash; and it's a fitting way to say goodbye, every bit as good as <I>Double Fantasy</I> and, in some respects, even sweeter. </p>&mdash; <b> Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

There are moments on Aerial Boundaries where it seems literally impossible that so much music is coming from one man and his guitar. Attacking his instrument, snapping strings, banging on the fingerboard with his right hand, Hedges plays supremely beautiful music with the technique of a deranged lunatic. It has been said that genius is at least one part madness -- although a questionable assertion in general terms -- when applied to Hedges and his music, the analogy holds. The songs on Aerial Boundaries are all beautiful and haunting in their own right; and it is this emphasis on composition over technique that makes this such an important recording. Hedges makes the breadth of his musical interest known by the inclusion of the extremely interesting electronic piece, \"Spare Change.\" Even though the liner notes assure the listener that the guitar is the origin for every sound heard, Hedges has electronically manipulated some of them to an almost unrecognizable point, yet he has still managed to create music of untarnished beauty. There is something of the music of minimalist Steve Reich's (thanked in the liner notes) in this track, as the cycling, overlapping guitar tracks are almost trance-like in their repetitiveness, yet utterly musical in their constant revelations. Aerial Boundaries is simply one of the finest acoustic guitar albums ever made, and deserves a place in the library of all serious music fans.</p>&mdash; <b>Daniel Gioffre</b>"

On Are You Experienced?, Jimi Hendrix synthesized various elements of the cutting edge of 1967 rock into music that sounded both futuristic and rooted in the best traditions of rock, blues, pop, and soul. It was his mind-boggling guitar work, of course, that got most of the ink, building upon the experiments of British innovators like Jeff Beck and Pete Townshend to chart new sonic territories in feedback, distortion, and sheer volume. It wouldn't have meant much, however, without his excellent material, whether psychedelic frenzy (\"Foxey Lady,\" \"Manic Depression,\" \"Purple Haze\"), instrumental freak-out jams (\"Third Stone From the Sun\"), blues (\"Red House,\" \"Hey Joe\"), or tender, poetic compositions (\"The Wind Cries Mary\") that demonstrated the breadth of his songwriting talents. Not to be underestimated were the contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who gave the music a rhythmic pulse that fused parts of rock and improvised jazz. Many of these songs are among Hendrix's very finest; it may be true that he would continue to develop at a rapid pace throughout the rest of his brief career, but he would never surpass his first LP in terms of consistently high quality. The British and American versions of the album differed substantially when they were initially released in 1967; MCA's 17-song CD reissue does everyone a favor by gathering all of the material from the two records in one place, adding a few B-sides from early singles as well.</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

Several of these (\"Hoochie Koochie Man,\" \"Killing Floor,\" \"Catfish Blues\") reveal his sometimes overlooked affinity for Chicago-style electric blues; there are also a couple of surprises (\"Hound Dog\" and \"Day Tripper\").

		"review": "<p>Jimi Hendrix's third and final album with the original Experience found him taking his funk and psychedelic sounds to the absolute limit. The result was not only one of the best rock albums of the era, but also Hendrix's original musical vision at its absolute apex. When revisionist rock critics refer to him as the maker of a generation's mightiest dope music, this is the album they're referring to. But Electric Ladyland is so much more than just background music for chemical intake. Kudos to engineer Eddie Kramer (who supervised the remastering of the original two-track stereo masters for this 1997 reissue on MCA) for taking Hendrix's visions of a soundscape behind his music and giving it all context, experimenting with odd mic techniques, echo, backward tape, flanging, and chorusing, all new techniques at the time, at least the way they're used here. What Hendrix sonically achieved on this record expanded the concept of what could be gotten out of a modern recording studio in much the same manner as Phil Spector had done a decade before with his Wall of Sound. As an album this influential (and as far as influencing a generation of players and beyond, this was his ultimate statement for many), the highlights speak for themselves: \"Crosstown Traffic,\" his reinterpretation of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower,\" \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp,\" the spacy \"1983...(A Merman I Should Turn to Be),\" and \"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),\" a landmark in Hendrix's playing. With this double set (now on one compact disc), Hendrix once again pushed the concept album to new horizons.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Cub Koda</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Band of Gypsys was the only live recording authorized by Jimi Hendrix before his death. It was recorded and released in order to get Hendrix out from under a contractual obligation that had been hanging over his head for a couple years. Helping him out were longtime friends Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on the drums because the Experience had broken up in June of 1969, following a show in Denver. This rhythm section was vastly different from the Experience. Buddy Miles was an earthy, funky drummer in direct contrast to the busy, jazzy leanings of Mitch Mitchell. Noel Redding was not really a bass player at all but a converted guitar player who was hired in large part because Hendrix liked his hair! These new surroundings pushed Hendrix to new creative heights. Along with this new rhythm section, Hendrix took these shows as an opportunity to showcase much of the new material he had been working on. The music was a seamless melding of rock, funk, and R&B, and tunes like \"Message to Love\" and \"Power to Love\" showed a new lyrical direction as well. Although he could be an erratic live performer, for these shows, Hendrix was on -- perhaps his finest performances. His playing was focused and precise. In fact, for most of the set, Hendrix stood motionless, a far cry from the stage antics that helped establish his reputation as a performer. Equipment problems had plagued him in past live shows as well, but everything was perfect for the Fillmore shows. His absolute mastery of his guitar and effects is even more amazing considering that this was the first time he used the Fuzz Face, wah-wah pedal, Univibe, and Octavia pedals on-stage together. The guitar tones he gets on \"Who Knows\" and \"Power to Love\" are powerful and intense, but nowhere is his absolute control more evident than on \"Machine Gun,\" where Hendrix conjures bombs, guns, and other sounds of war from his guitar, all within the context of a coherent musical statement. The solo on \"Machine Gun\" totally rewrote the book on what a man could do with an electric guitar and is arguably the most groundbreaking and devastating guitar solo ever. These live versions of \"Message to Love\" and \"Power to Love\" are far better than the jigsaw puzzle studio versions that were released posthumously. Two Buddy Miles compositions are also included, but the show belongs to Jimi all the way. Band of Gypsys is not only an important part of the Hendrix legacy, but one of the greatest live albums ever.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Jimi Hendrix remains arguably one of the greatest electric guitarists that ever lived, who, upon his untimely passing in 1970, left behind an enormous wealth of previously unheard studio recordings which, according to those in the know, had the potential to offer new and compelling insights into one of the 20th Century's ultimate rock instrumentalists, someone whose genius has often been likened to that of Robert Johnson and Miles Davis.</p><p>Both Sides of the Sky is the third and purportedly final instalment in a trilogy of albums (starting with 2010's Valleys of Neptune and 2013's People, Hell & Angels) dedicated to highlighting Jimi's creative development throughout the last two years of what was an incredibly short albeit spectacular career.</p><p>As Hendrix scholar and archivist John McDermott stated in relation to the project: \"I have had the good fortune of being able to listen to everything in the vault and I got a sense that some of these songs trace back to '67 and he was still working on them. Jimi really tried to be whittling down songs, working hard to refine things. There was a constant evolution of the content.\"</p><p>Starting with \"Mannish Boy,\" a bluesy funky rocker that finds Hendrix exploring his inner Muddy Waters, the cut is also the first known recording he made with Buddy Miles (drums) and Billy Cox (Bass) in April 1969, several months before the trio officially named themselves the Band of Gypsys. \"Lover Man,\" also recorded with Cox and Miles in December 1969, is another up-tempo tune Jimi had been tinkering with since 1967's Are You Experienced but never quite managed to perfect to his satisfaction.</p><p>He lets rip on a scorching \"Hear My Train A Comin',\" backed by Mitch Mitchell (drums) and Noel Redding (bass), followed by a country-tinged rendition of \"Stepping Stone,\" the last single released during his lifetime. On Stephen Stills' \"$20 Fine\" Hendrix proves that he could easily have been a fifth member of CSNY, thanks to some very tasty guitar licks, while on \"Power of Soul\" he out-funks Funkadelic by at least a few thousand light years.</p><p>On other tracks Jimi burns the midnight amp via \"Jungle,\" a previously unreleased instrumental, along with an embryonic take of \"Sweet Angel\" (recorded in January 1968), a song inspired by a dream Jimi had of his late mother, and continued to work on until his death.</p><p>There are also recordings with Johnny Winter and previous band-mate Lonnie Youngblood, each of which places a historic spotlight on Hendrix's blues credentials.</p><p>Fans of Crosby, Stills & Nash may be fascinated to hear a nascent reading of Joni Mitchell's \"Woodstock,\" with Stephen Stills singing and Hendrix filling in the role on bass. On other tracks Jimi branches out, exploring new musical territory on the medium-tempo ballad \"Send My Love To Linda,\" and closing cut, the oft-bootlegged \"Cherokee Mist,\" a moody instrumental which sees Hendrix playing electric sitar to Mitch Mitchell's tribal beat.</p><p>Both Sides of the Sky is in no way a perfect record, nor does it definitively illustrate Hendrix's undisputed genius. But what it does offer is further insight into Jimi's seemingly unlimited potential and talent as an artist. That his music continues to inspire people to this day is a testament to his enduring brilliance.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sacha O'Grady</strong></p><hr/></p>Both Sides Of The Sky presents 13 studio recordings including 10 which have never before been released. All but two of these studio recordings were made during a fertile period between January 1968 and 1970. Jimi's mastery and use of the studio as a proving ground for new songs resulted in a growing collection of extraordinary material. This album completes a trilogy of albums [with Valleys Of Neptune and People, Hell & Angels] presenting the best and most significant unissued studio recordings remaining in the Hendrix archive. The songs include fascinating alternate versions of \"Stepping Stone,\" \"Lover Man\" and \"Hear My Train A Comin'\" as well as recordings where Jimi is joined by special guests Johnny Winter and Stephen Stills. Both Sides Of The Sky was mixed by Eddie Kramer, the engineer for all of Hendrix's albums throughout the guitarist's lifetime, and produced by Janie Hendrix, Kramer and John McDermott.</p></p><strong>Mannish Boy</strong> - The first ever studio session by the group Hendrix would christen as his Band Of Gypsys. Hendrix, Cox & Miles shared a love for the blues as this driving, uptempo reworking of \"Mannish Boy\" by Muddy Waters makes clear.</p></p><strong>Lover Man</strong> - Just two weeks before their triumphant New Year's concerts at the Fillmore East in NYC [yielding both 1970's Band Of Gypsys and 2016's sequel Machine Gun], Hendrix gathered with Cox and Miles to cut this dynamic rendition of what had become a favorite concert staple.</p></p><strong>Stepping Stone</strong> - A totally unique take on this Hendrix favorite, with Jimi showcasing both blues and country styled licks atop a relentless, galloping beat.</p></p><strong>$20 Fine</strong> -Stephen Stills joined Jimi, Mitch Mitchell and Buddy Miles Express keyboardist Duane Hitchings at this September 1969 session. With Stephen handling lead vocals and organ, Jimi added multiple guitar parts to this rollicking Stills original.</p></p><strong>Power Of Soul</strong> - This 1970 studio session came three weeks after the Band Of Gypsys concerts at the Fillmore East. While a live version remains one of the highpoints of Band Of Gypsys, Jimi never released a studio version during his lifetime. For this album, we present the mix that Hendrix and Kramer prepared of the complete song at Electric Lady on August 22, 1970.</p></p><strong>Jungle</strong> - The influence of Curtis Mayfield can be heard here as Jimi expands on the \"Villanova Junction Blues\" theme he made famous by its inclusion in the 1970 Woodstock documentary.</p></p><strong>Things I Used To Do</strong> - Jimi is joined for this rendition of Guitar Slim's blues classic by Johnny Winter. Jimi's trademark guitar work and Winter's deft slide playing weaves in and around the foundation set by bassist Billy Cox and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young drummer Dallas Taylor.</p></p><strong>Georgia Blues</strong> - Jimi reunited with some old friends from his pre-Experience days. Lonnie Youngblood, with whom Hendrix played in R&B groups like Curtis Knight & The Squires, voiced this superb twelve bar blues neatly underpinned by Hendrix's sublime rhythm and lead guitar work.</p></p><strong>Sweet Angel</strong> - With Axis: Bold As Love only just released, Jimi immediately turned his focus to recording what would become Electric Ladyland. This gorgeous, instrumental reading of \"Angel,\", features Jimi on guitar, bass and vibraphone joined by Mitch Mitchell.</p></p><strong>Woodstock</strong> - Stephen Stills came to this session fresh from having visited Joni Mitchell, who had a new song that Stills was excited to try and record. Long before CSNY's version, Stephen, Jimi and Buddy Miles recorded this amazing rendition.</p></p><strong>Send My Love To Linda</strong> - A superb new Hendrix original composition recorded with Cox and Miles in the aftermath of their successful Band Of Gypsys performances at the Fillmore East.</p></p><strong>Cherokee Mist</strong> - Together with drummer Mitch Mitchell, Jimi created this moody, evocative original complete with his playing of a sitar to complement his traditional electric guitar.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Amazon.com</strong></p>"

Its main virtue is that, in contrast to Smash Hits -- the only compilation of Hendrix's work approved by the artist -- it extends its reach past 1968. The last of the tracks come from the abortive First Rays of the New Rising Sun album, left unfinished at the time of his death, and show off a more R&B and soul-oriented sound than Hendrix was generally known for -- and are worth the price of the disc by themselves. In fact, some of these cuts recall Hendrix's history with the Isley Brothers, but done his way, with the range of sounds that he was generating in 1970. The disc concludes with the obligatory live version of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" from Woodstock, which is of massive historical and cultural importance. Where it falls short is by leaving out \"Can You See Me\" and \"Remember,\" which are on Smash Hits -- it's a pity because the presence of two of those cuts (which, in fairness, can be found on Are You Experienced?) would make this compilation perfect in most respects.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Posthumous reconstructions of unfinished works are inherently dangerous, principally because even the most capable scholar or producer can only make, at best, an educated guess as to how the work in question would have been completed. Indeed, in dealing with some such pieces, you're sometimes lucky to get the work of the artist claimed (the Mozart Symphony No. 37 is a case in point -- it doesn't exist; the piece once labeled Symphony No. 37 and attributed to Mozart is now known to have been authored by Michael Haydn); and while there's no question that the songs on this CD were recorded by Jimi Hendrix, even the people who worked on the sides with him can't say which songs would have ended up on the finished version of First Rays of the New Rising Sun (assuming that he even ended up using that title for the album), or what embellishments he would have added to any of them in the course of completing them, or even if he might not have totally reconsidered such matters as tempo and approach to any of them. In the end, First Rays of the New Rising Sun is a little like any of the various \"performing editions\" of Gustav Mahler's never-completed Symphony No. 10, in that what's here is impressive, but may have little to do with what would finally have been heard by the public, had the artist lived to finish it -- we don't know if Mahler would have scored a particular passage for horns or strings, or Hendrix would have put another, different lead guitar part, or a second (or third) guitar part on to any of these songs, or added choruses, or re-thought his vocal performance? Hendrix had gone so long between albums, seemingly adrift stylistically at various times, that there's no telling exactly what direction he was finally going to end up working toward. All of that said, this is a superb album, and a worthy if very different, earthier successor to Electric Ladyland's psychedelic excursions -- the later tracks, ironically enough, cut at that album's long promised and long-delayed studio namesake -- and also show him working in some genuinely new directions. For starters, Hendrix's voice emerges here as a genuinely powerful instrument in its own right -- his voice was never as exposed in the mix of his songs as it is here; partly this is because Hendrix and engineer Eddie Kramer never finished embellishing the songs, or completed the final mixes. But whatever the reasons, the change is refreshing -- Hendrix's voice is not only powerful and expressive throughout, but a more melodic instrument than it seemed on his earlier releases; indeed, hearing these sides is a bit like listening to those middle-years Muddy Waters recordings when Chess Records had the Chicago blues legend abandon his guitar playing in favor of concentrating on his singing; the results might not be what all fans expected, but it sure sounds good, because it turns out that Hendrix had an expressive voice and was also moving his music into new areas that were stimulating him. A lot of the material here shows Hendrix, for the first time, moving his songs specifically into a black music idiom, embracing R&B and funk elements in his singing, playing, and overall sound; some of it could qualify as Hendrix's extension of his years playing with the Isley Brothers. Songs here such as \"Freedom,\" \"Izabella,\" \"Angel,\" and \"Dolly Dagger\" show him finally acknowledging that musical world that he had largely by-passed, and the closer, \"Belly Button Window,\" is one of his most successful traditional bluesy outings. The psychedelic workouts are more jam-like and experimental, and the ballads are prettier and even more dreamlike in their background soundscapes. \"Astro Man\" also captures a light moment for the artist, as he opens the guitar workout with a quote from the Mighty Mouse theme song, sotto voce beneath the guitar. And speaking of the guitar, despite the prominence of Hendrix's vocals on a lot of this album, the guitar playing is pretty much up to the standard that one would expect, if not necessarily the final versions of some of the songs. Most of the material on First Rays of the New Rising Sun surfaced among the various posthumous Hendrix LPs issued from the 1970s through the early 1990s, but a lot of it was tampered with, mostly in the form of posthumous overdubbed embellishments supervised by producer Alan Douglas -- all of that has been stripped off and the multi-track masters retrieved and restored. What he would have eventually come up with and released as his next musical statement is anyone's guess, but this gets you as close to that answer -- and that vision -- as you're ever likely to get. It is the best representation of where the songs were at the point that he died, and it's fully competitive, in terms of merits and surprises, with his trio of completed studio albums.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

Things start loose, <I>very loose</I>, on \"Pass It On,\" which is actually the music from \"Straight Ahead\" with some off the cuff lyrics, then into \"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun).\" Hendrix's guitar tone is fantastic, and there are some fine moments of soloing, but as far as the songs go, he seems distracted.</p><p> Things start to pick up with \"Lover Man\" (check Billy Cox's bass playing here), and Hendrix really seems to findhimself while romping through some older material like \"Stone Free\"and \"Hey Joe.\" In fact, the solo on \"Stone Free\" is amazing, andquite unlike other live versions. It's clear that all the guitarelectronics were working together (despite the brief securityinterruption on \"Hey Joe;\" again, shades of <I>Isle of Wight</I>), and by the time he gets into \"I Don't Live Today\" and \"Machine Gun,\"Hendrix is in the stratosphere.

		"review": "<p>The Jimi Plays Berkeley film, documenting his performances at the Berkeley Community Theatre on May 30, 1970, was about as haphazardly organized as most of the projects from the final year or two of his life were. It endured a post-directorial cut from Hendrix manager Mike Jeffery and, even with the insertion of some footage of period Berkeley rioting and protest, still clocked in at less than an hour. Perhaps it could have been better if more footage was prepared -- and, unfortunately, a few of the songs weren't filmed in complete versions -- but what remains is actually a pretty enjoyable and valuable document of Hendrix in concert. Just a few months prior to his death, he's backed by the reliable Mitch Mitchell on drums and newer trio mainstay Billy Cox on bass, mixing some old classics (\"Purple Haze,\" \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\" \"I Don't Live Today\") with quite a few selections he wouldn't release on record during his lifetime (\"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun),\" \"Lover Man,\" \"Hear My Train a Comin'\"). Hendrix seems to be a little tired and fed-up on some of the footage that survives of his concerts from his final months, but that's not the case here. He seems relaxed and in a pretty good mood, even on the obligatory \"Purple Haze,\" the one song on which he really pulls out his most famed bag of tricks, like playing the guitar with his teeth. There's also \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" not destined to make the lasting impact as the version filmed for Woodstock, of course, but impressively executed here. Most video releases have an audio-only section of concert recordings from the second set of the night's performances (also available separately in standard audio as Live at Berkeley). It's unclear, though, why neither the audio nor video included any material from the first show; as a consequence, some songs in the film, like \"Hear My Train a Comin'\" and \"Johnny B. Goode,\" aren't heard on the audio-only portion.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

This Jimi Hendrix bootleg was considered special because one of its two LPs was pressed on red vinyl, while the other was pressed on blue vinyl. Perhaps the bootlegger, which called itself Collector's Edition, thought that colored vinyl would make up for inferior sound quality - and make no mistake, this double LP won't exactly win over any audiophiles. Obviously, the person who taped 'Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky at the L.A. Forum on April 5, 1970, used a mono home recorder, making this a bootleg that only a die-hard collector would be interested in. But despite the poor sound quality, many collectors won't want to pass up Hendrix's inspired performances of such favorites as \"Foxy Lady,\" \"Purple Haze,\" \"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),\" and \"Spanish Castle Magic.\" An extended performance of \"Room Full of Mirrors\" is excessively long-winded, but because Hendrix was such a phenomenal musician and hired such impressive sidemen, one can easily forgive his occasional excesses. It's regrettable that this bootleg has lousy sound quality, for Hendrix's set - excesses and all - is a prime example of musical genius at work.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Alex Henderson</strong></p>"

Most people assume it was Woodstock, which was a larger festival, but by the time Jimi took the stage at around 9 a.m. on Monday morning, the Woodstock crowd was down to about 25,000 stragglers. Estimated between 300,000 and 400,000, the actual crowd at Hendrix's Atlanta Pop performance was hard to pin down due to the fact that many of the festivalgoers turned up after dark, in an effort to stay out of the stifling heat of Atlanta in the summertime. The trio of Jimi, Mitch, and Billy Cox had been touring for about two and a half months solid when July 4 rolled around, and they sound really tight kicking off the show. \"Fire\" starts the set, and one immediately notices how differently Billy Cox plays it versus Noel Redding. \"Spanish Castle Magic\" has Jimi trying out some new solo ideas and he really starts feeling it on a very improvisational, extended \"Red House.\" A rare live performance of \"Room Full of Mirrors\" is followed by an absolutely incredible version of \"Hear My Train A Comin'.\" Jimi is just in amazing form as the ideas just keep coming: the entire solo is so well constructed it could almost be composed. This is a guitar performance nearly equal to \"Machine Gun\" on Band of Gypsys, and worth the price of admission by itself. After a nice version of \"Message to Love,\" things falter just a bit with Jimi blowing his vocal entrance and muffing some lyrics on \"All Along the Watchtower\" followed by a good, not great, version of \"Freedom.\" He starts finding his guitar groove again though, and by \"Hey Joe\" he's once again in excellent form. A solid version of \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" leads into a really nice extended version of \"Stone Free\" with some cool new solo ideas. \"Star Spangled Banner\" is actually punctuated with real fireworks and the set closes with another new song, \"Straight Ahead.\" The music on Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival has been available in collector's circles for some time, but it has never sounded better than it does here. Despite a brief lull mid-set, the revamped Experience turned in an exciting show on July 4, 1970, and with \"Hear My Train A Comin',\" Jimi turned in one of the greatest solos of his career.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

Spanning a career that exploded in 1966 and never let up for four years, this four-CD, 56-track compilation may not be the last of the literally dozens of posthumous Hendrix releases, but it certainly is the most comprehensive.</p><p>There is no doubt that the Hendrix vault has been exploited and revamped many times over since the guitarist’s untimely demise 30 years ago. In the last few years, the Experience Hendrix organization – which is overseen by Jimi’s father Al and half-sister Janie – with the likes of Eddie Kramer, Hendrix’ longtime engineer, have released some high quality collections that unequivocally capture the legendary axe slinger in all his splendor and glory. First Rays Of The New Rising Sun was supposedly the album that Hendrix was in the midst of completing when he passed away. South Saturn Delta includes historic alternates and remastered tracks previously only available on sub-standard releases of the mid 1970s. Live At The Fillmore East and Live At Woodstock exhibit the post-Experience Hendrix at the height of his powers as a live performer. But it’s as if these releases were merely laying the foundations for what was to come. With the box set, Janie Hendrix, Eddie Kramer and co-producer John McDermott have unearthed the mother lode.</p><p>Disc one opens with an alternate version of probably Hendrix’ most well known song, \"Purple Haze.\" From there we are taken to the fourth live performance by the newly christened Experience where Hendrix, drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding unleash killer performances of \"Killing Floor\" and \"Hey Joe.\" The disc goes on to document Hendrix' songwriting and studio prowess with stunning, somewhat raw versions of \"Foxey Lady,\" \"Third Stone From The Sun,\" \"If 6 Was 9\" and a Dylan cover that even Dylan admired, \"Like A Rolling Stone.\"</p><p>Disc two sustains the momentum with sizzling renditions of \"Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band\" – at this point only three months old – and \"Burning Of The Midnight Lamp.\" On to more studio outtakes, we glimpse the Experience/Chas Chandler combination in full bloom. It’s arguable that when Chandler – the former Animal who had more or less \"discovered\" Hendrix – took the producer helm, Hendrix was at his most creative. Certainly there was a free amount of experimentation taking place as verified by the alternate takes of \"Little Wing\" and \"Bold As Love.\" The disc shuffles back and forth from studio and live tracks, much of it without Mitchell, Redding or Chandler. It is conceivable to understand that once everyone went home, Hendrix would continue to record with who ever was around. The final track captures a solitary Hendrix plucking out an elaborate production of \"Star Spangled Banner,\" months before his most celebrated translation at Woodstock.</p><p>While a revolving door of personnel continue to make appearances, the essence of Hendrix, Mitchell and Redding persists throughout disc three. Even in their final days, the band gave their all, as exhibited by smoking \"live\" versions of \"I Don’t Live Today,\" \"Little Wing,\" \"Red House,\" \"Purple Haze\" and \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" – all intended for release during Hendrix’ lifetime. The disc closes with an unreleased take of \"Izabella,\" one of the first post-Experience recordings made with Billy Cox on bass.</p><p>As things wind down with disc four, Hendrix continues to excel as a guitarist, songwriter, singer and studio junkie. Hendrix floats back and fourth from basic blues to more cerebral, less frantic material. The rare Band of Gypsys studio sessions here signal a more stripped down direction. Much of the subsequent \"live\" material – with Mitchell returning to the fold – is of then-unreleased studio experimentations. By the reaction from the few hundred in Hawaii to \"Hey Baby/In From The Storm\" to over half-million at the Isle of Wight – Hendrix’ biggest audience – to a more seasoned version of \"In From The Storm,\" you’d have thought these were staples in his catalog. While the finishing touches of the studio version of \"In From The Storm\" were still being added, Hendrix strummed \"Slow Blues,\" the last session he ever recorded, and appropriately the last track on the set.</p><p>Even as the Hendrix family continues to release live concerts and odd compilations from a seemingly endless number of tapes, The Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set, complete with an 80-page, full-color booklet, should placate even the most casual of fans. Inferior product is bound to follow while the catalog is salvaged for every last note. I could expand on the plunder of millionaire family members, but at least they’re doing the material justice. What a shame that Jimi Hendrix himself isn’t around to enjoy the fruits of his labor.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Shawn Perry</strong></p>"

Where it falls short is by leaving out \"Can You See Me\" and \"Remember,\" which are on Smash Hits -- it's a pity because the presence of two of those cuts (which, in fairness, can be found on Are You Experienced?) would make this compilation perfect in most respects.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Daniel Hope's adventurous spirit this time leads him into repertoire that's familiar to Baroque violinists but which few \"modern\" players have ventured into: that of the 17th-century virtuosi who took the first steps in making the fiddle the concert instrument it is now. To judge from his impeccably stylish performances, Hope has the music-making of period colleagues ringing in his ears; but although there's more than a touch of the Hespèrions, for instance, about his bubbling, percussion-enhanced accounts of Falconieri and Ortiz, it would be wrong to suggest that he's \"playing at Baroque\" rather than creating something that's individual and true to himself.</p><p>For a start, his choice of music is clearly the product of much consideration, for alongside favourites such as the Pachelbel Canon and Bach's \"Air on a G String\" (exquisitely performed with a one-to-a-part ensemble drawn from members of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe), Hope homes in on single, characterful movements from relatively obscure larger works, including sonatas by the dazzling German Johann Paul von Westhoff, whom even period players have tended to neglect.</p><p>The concertos by Telemann and Geminiani are thoughtfully chosen, and there is also a handful of specially made arrangements. So what impression will be gained by new listeners following Hope and his excellent collaborators in this repertoire? He himself says he wants to emphasise the modern-ness of the music, and the exotic attraction some of these wandering composer-violinists must have had in person. In this he succeeds entirely, for this is an exciting disc with a heady, pied-piper power over the listener that comes from realising that the bright sense of discovery once felt by these composers is being experienced just as much by their modern-day interpreters. You can't ask for much more than that.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Kemp</strong></p>"

These are stellar, funky, and forward-thinking cuts that, while highly regarded, are often overlooked in favor of Hubbard's '60s Blue Note recordings. While fans of '70s fusion will want to pick up the complete albums, this works as a solid introduction to the second half of Hubbard's career. Included are all the title songs from the albums, including 1970's \"Red Clay\" and 1972's \"First Light\" as well as such standout album tracks as \"Theme From Kareem\" off 1978's <i>Super Blue</i>.</p>&mdash; <b>Matt Collar</b>"

		"review": "<p>This record is a typically unassuming artefact from the early 1970s Aussie rock scene that seems to want to hide its light under a bushel. It doesn’t jump up and scream out “Look at me! Play me!”. On the surface, it seems to go about its business like a kindly old uncle sitting down to a nice cuppa tea but when you finally lift the lid on its contents you find that there’s a sly and demented sense of humour going on. It’s actually more like a naughty school boy enjoying a giggle at everyone else’s expense than any kind of avuncular persona you first thought.</p><p>Of course the giveaway is when you take a closer look at the front cover line drawing – a seedy flasher in flat cap, half-sized overcoat and rancid sneakers with a big nose, wide arse and hairy legs – which suggests sheer entertainment and more to be had inside. And then what of the song titles on the back cover – ‘Be My Honey’, ‘Pie in the Sky’, ‘Blue Movies Made Me Cry’, ‘We are Indelible’, ‘In the Bog’, ‘Esmeralda’, ‘Some Good Advice’ – surely enough enticement to give it a decent listen. Frank Zappa asked the question “does humour belong in music?” and clearly guitarist / singer / song writer Mike Rudd and The Indelible Murtceps agreed.</p><p>Since 1969 Rudd had been steering his band Spectrum with a steely resolve, to a great deal of success on the local scene. The group had gone to #1 in early 1971 with the enduring ‘I’ll Be Gone’ single but Rudd was still intent on presenting Spectrum as a “concert” attraction. In general the music was full-blown progressive rock with psychedelic and space-rock touches; audiences could sit cross-legged on the floor, soak up the vibes and let the expansive musical textures waft over them like great clouds of intoxicating marijuana smoke.</p><p>Not long after Spectrum’s chart success, Ross Wilson’s new band Daddy Cool went to #1 with ‘Eagle Rock’. The two bands embarked on the joint national Aquarius tour, and Rudd noticed how Daddy Cool encouraged their audiences to dance around and join in the fun. Rudd decided to forego Spectrum’s complex material for a much simpler, more danceable sound in order to work the lucrative discotheque / dance circuit.</p><p>In October 1971, he created a new band called The Indelible Murtceps utilising the same musicians (bassist Bill Putt, drummer Ray Arnott and organist Lee Neale) but with a different outlook. This allowed Spectrum to continue as a creative unit while the alter-ego Murtceps simply played for fun and profit. In addition to the more energetic, danceable sound, the basic difference musically was Neale playing the electric piano instead of Hammond organ. Mike Rudd was also billing himself now as My Crudd. The band enjoyed a minor hit single with the jaunty ‘Esmeralda’ b/w ‘We Are Indelible’ (#36 in May 1972) and issued the entertaining Warts Up Your Nose album (#19 in December 1972).</p><p>Prior to that, as well as featuring some astonishingly imaginative material Spectrum’s legendary double album Milesago (December 1971) also incorporated elements of Rudd’s new approach to dance moves with the likes of ‘Play a Song That I Know’, ‘But That’s Alright’ and ‘Virgin’s Tale’ being suited to the Indelible Murtceps gambit. It was as if one entity had already started to assimilate the other.</p><p>When the band appeared at the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival, held over the Australia Day weekend at the end of January 1972, they were able to appear as both Spectrum and The Indelible Murtceps, yet each set incorporated elements of the other. The subsequent Various Artists double live album Sunbury issued by EMI later in the year featured Spectrum doing ‘Some Good Advice’ and ‘I’ll Be Gone’, while the Murtceps did ‘We Are Indelible’, ‘Be My Honey’ and ‘But That’s Alright’.</p><p>One of the great things about Warts Up Your Nose is that eight of the eleven tracks run for less than three minutes; only ‘Esmeralda’ and ‘Excuse Me Just One Moment’ go slightly over that mark while even the 12 minute 45 second ‘Some Good Advice’, which retains the Spectrum musical stamp, is deceptively simple in execution and outcome. The addition of a four-piece horn section on ‘Excuse Me Just One Moment’ and ‘Stay Another Day’ lends a jazzy swing to proceedings. All up, some of the quaintly bizarre notions expressed in ‘Pie in the Sky’, ‘Blue Movies Made Me Cry’, ‘Hand Jive’, ‘Stay Another Day’, ‘Some Good Advice’ and ‘Esmeralda’ retain a refreshing outlook to this day.</p><p>While Warts Up Your Nose is kinda rootsy in its own way, it’s clearly not one of those “heavy monster psych” records that collectors of arcane 1970s pieces go nuts over. The sad things is that it has yet to be reissued on CD; Aztec had started the Spectrum CD reissues project some years ago, releasing Spectrum Part One and Milesago but various unforeseen circumstances conspired to prevent things from moving ahead. The Spectrum / Murtceps albums Testimonial and Terminal Buzz are likewise waiting in the wings for a second chance on CD.</p><p>I still believe that these are the kinds of records that people need to hear again in the advancing digital age. Mike Rudd is still (occasionally) hitting the stage with Spectrum, despite the death last year of his musical partner of 44 years Bill Putt, so it would suggest that fans still appreciate this guy’s musical integrity. Let’s hope Warts Up Your Nose appears on CD sometime in the near future.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ian McFarlane</strong</p>"

		"review": "<p>On the night of November 14, 1991, 500 million people scattered across 27 nations simultaneously watched Michael Jackson grab his crotch 17 times. He simulated masturbation, shattered car windows with crowbars, and unleashed the primal screams expected from a man who owned publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue. Then he turned into a black panther. The video ends with Bart Simpson striking a B-Boy pose in a Michael Jackson shirt, and ordering Homer to \"chill out, homeboy.\" It shattered all previous viewing records on Fox.The $4 million, 11-minute unedited telecast of \"Black or White\" ranks among the Smithsonian-worthy artifacts of '90s pop monoculture—up there with Nirvana trashing their instruments at the '92 VMAs, the premiere of \"Summertime\" after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Hillary Clinton hitting the Macarena at the '96 DNC. No one ever had more juice than Jackson did at the time, and it's difficult to imagine that anyone ever will again.This was right around the time when they named him an official king of the Ivory Coast. In Gabon, 100,000 greeted him with signs reading \"Welcome Home, Michael.\" His universal popularity was on par with pizza and the polio vaccine. Safe enough to be Captain EO at Disneyland, hood-certified enough to throw up the set with the Crips.The 33-year-old had recently signed the most lucrative contract in recording history, worth hundreds of millions, giving him his own label and the highest royalty rate in the industry. What's more, no one thought it was out of line for someone who had sold close to 70 million records in the previous decade. In the press, Sony claimed the deal would reap them billions.So when he released the first single from Dangerous, his first album in four years, fanatical interest led MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox to televise it at the same time—offering the greatest strategic victory since the Berlin Wall tumbled two years prior. And even though Jackson technically didn't cause the collapse of East German Communism, his star wattage was so supreme that the Stasi secret police spied on him during his 1988 Berlin concert, fearing that obsessive MJ fans would accomplish what Reagan couldn't.With \"Black or White,\" Jackson lashed out at his public perception. In the interim since 1987's Bad, he'd grappled with both outlandish rumors (buying the Elephant Man's bones, sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber) and some that drew blood (allegations of bleaching his skin). The innocent popcorn-eating Michael of Thriller was gone, but calling him \"Wacko Jacko\" was slander. He wanted us to know he was a man, an eccentric sure, but an adult with deeply rooted beliefs.Released only five months before the LA Riots, the Rodney King beating and murder of Latasha Harlins almost certainly factored into Jackson's increasingly political slant. \"Black or White\" articulated a utopian vision of a post-racial future while acknowledging the sins of contemporary bigotry.  He demands equality, shouting that he \"ain't second to none.\" He growls, \"I ain't scared of no sheets\" (presumably Klansmen). Its hook offers his dream of a color-blind society, echoing Martin Luther King.But this was Michael Jackson, not O' Shea. Being King of Pop meant the need for mass appeal. The \"Black or White\" video exists as a microcosm of Dangerous itself. It potently affirms Jackson's manhood, offers passionate screeds against racial strife, gang violence, and a parasitic American media. This is the album as multi-media spectacle, a precursor to Lemonade, with accusations of infidelity substituted for videos of Macaulay Culkin doing air guitar windmills to a Slash guitar solo and lip sync rapping about turf wars.The lone #1 single from the 32-million selling Dangerous, \"Black or White\" spent seven weeks atop the Billboard charts. Directed by John Landis (\"Thriller,\" National Lampoon's Animal House) the first quarter of its video reveals Jackson's mischievous child-like streak, with Culkin towing out Spinal Tap-sized speakers, amplifying the volume to \"ARE YOU NUTS!?!,\" and shredding so hard that George Wendt gets ejected into the stratosphere screaming \"Da Bears.\"It blends into his idealistic visionary side that wanted to heal the world through philanthropy and moonwalking. There is pop locking with Balinese dancers, rain dances with Native Americans, folk dances in front of the Kremlin, and the serenade of a Hindu goddess on a freeway. This is the magical Michael Jackson of our early memories—the man with the graceful dance moves and lithe falsetto that seemed celestially ordained (masking a notoriously intense perfectionist streak). Faces of all races harmoniously morph into one another, the most cutting edge FX that 1991 had to offer.In the third section, boy becomes man: Jackson struts through a wall of flames, Henley shirt open, screaming at his enemies like a mad king. It gives way to Culkin rapping in shades and oversized gold chains, which is just as well considering that this is the man who actually spit the bars. Jackson's embrace of hip-hop not only aligned him with the popular sound of black (and white) youth culture, it adds an aggressive masculinity unseen in his catalogue, and ultimately paved the way for the late period Biggie therapy session.Of course, in the final section, Jackson turns into a black panther. You understand that meaning. So did millions of parents in Tipper Gore America, who flooded Fox and its local affiliates with phone calls, forcing Jackson's team to re-cut and sanitize the video.A quarter century later, it seems absurd that Michael Jackson smashing a few windows before turning into a Jungle Book character could be cause for mass protest, but you have to remember how adored and family-friendly Michael Jackson was. My parents only owned two records: Thriller and Bad. So until I was 9 years old, I listened to those two almost every single day of my life, and honestly I didn't really need anything else. Michael Jackson was my entire conception of music. Millions more could say the same thing.So when he dropped \"Black or White,\" it was shocking. If he was previously pop's Peter Pan figure, Jackson had suddenly adopted a more carnal streak, but even here it was cartoonish. If the adult world looked dull and stifling, Jackson's imagination offered a hope that it was possible not to wind up like George Wendt, bloated on a couch with a bored housewife. You could hang out with Macaulay Culkin, dance on top of the Statue of Liberty, and if all else failed, you could transform into a panther and bounce.* * *Imagine being Teddy Riley in 1991. You've gone from humble origins in Harlem to inventing New Jack Swing; you've produced multiple hits for your own band Guy, Bobby Brown, and Keith Sweat (\"I Want Her\"). Then late one night, you get a phone call from Michael Jackson telling you that he needs you to produce his new album—in effect making you the new Quincy Jones. All before your 24th birthday.Before Riley headed west, Jackson had labored on Dangerous for over a year to varying degrees of success. Something always seemed off. Bad might have been the last album before hip-hop became the de facto soundtrack of urban culture. 1988 changed everything. Public Enemy, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane left the competition sounding effete and timid. Gang wars and the crack epidemic continued to inflame inner cities. Songs like \"Smooth Criminal\" seemed obsolete. Meanwhile Jackson's sister Janet had recently delivered a hard-stomping R&B-pop classic in 1989's Rhythm Nation 1814. Its influence on her older brother was so great that he even asked Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis to produce Dangerous. Out of loyalty to Janet, they turned him down. According to his engineer, Bruce Swedien, Michael was searching for something \"very street that young people would be able to identify with.\"He wasn't alone. His longtime competition Prince sought to re-connect in a similar fashion, forming the New Power Generation with rapper, Tony M. Released just one month before Dangerous, the purple one's Diamonds and Pearls exists as a companion piece, documents of blurring eras. As '80s pop gave way to '90s hip-hop, they sought to find their place in the re-configured landscape. Except while Prince predictably constructed his own insular unit, Jackson looked outwards to Riley, the hottest producer of the moment.If that seems obvious today, it wasn't at the start of 1991. Many mainstream artists still saw hip-hop as a passing fad or stereotyped it as nihilistic and violent. Jackson needed to walk the fine line between disposable bubblegum rap like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, and alienating longtime disciples with something too radical.After preparing grooves in Q-Tip's Soundtrack Studio in Queens, Riley flew out to the Neverland Ranch to meet the master. There was a tour of the trophy room, the carousel, and the zoo, and then after they talked late into the night, Jackson put Riley on his personal helicopter and had him flown to the Universal City Hilton, a short distance from the San Fernando Valley studios where they recorded Dangerous. Riley began work the next day.Jackson established nerve centers at Record One and Larrabee Studios, just a few miles down Ventura Blvd. The latter had the SSL mixing console that Riley needed to make the tracks slap, and despite his pop reputation, Jackson wanted his new songs as hard as humanly possible. Engineers remember Jackson demanding that they play the New Jack Swing songs so loud that your ears bled. He invariably blew up a pair of headphones each session.As you'd expect, the recording process boasted its requisite share of idiosyncrasy. Nancy Reagan visited the studio once, requiring the Secret Service to search the place for hours prior to her visit. Brooke Shields called frequently to talk to Michael, who materialized every day in the same black dress pants and red button-down shirt (he had a clothing rack of just two items).One night, he left early to go to Tower Records, which had been shut down just for him to spend $1,500 on CDs. Another afternoon, he ordered several $900 remote controlled motorcycles brought to the studio. Despite usually eating meals prepared by a personal chef, Jackson requested McDonald's for lunch on one occasion. He'd never actually eaten there before, but someone told him it was good, so he ordered one of everything on the menu and took a small bite of each. (The fish sandwich particularly wowed him.)Then there was Madonna. During March and April of 1991, Jackson and Madonna went out to dinner at least three times, which led tabloids to immediately report that they were dating. During these conversations, Jackson reportedly asked her to duet on the unfinished version of what became, \"In the Closet.\"\"I think all he wanted was a provocative title, and ultimately he didn't want the content of the song to live up to the title,\" Madonna said at the time. \"I said, ‘Look, Michael, if you want to do something with me, you have to be willing to go all the way or I'm not going to do it.'\"His engineers remember her visiting him once at the studio, where they spent a little time in his private room in the back. \"When I asked Michael later about her visit he said that she ‘scared' him,\" his engineer Rob Disner later said. \"I think we all speculated that she tried to make a ‘move' on him but Michael never said. In any event, we never saw her again.\"The creative union most likely fizzled due to major stylistic divergences. Madonna imagined an extreme makeover: giving him a Caesar haircut, getting him out of his bedazzled military uniforms, taking him to New York and hanging out with the voguers, House of Xtravaganza. Michael wanted to go hip-hop and ultimately enlisted rappers Heavy D and Aqil Davidson of Wreckx N' Effect as the principal guest vocalists.During the summer of '91, competition broke out within the two studios and three rooms dedicated to Dangerous. At Record One, Bill Bottrell and Bruce Swedien worked on the album's softer more adult contemporary material (and \"Black or White\"). At Larrabee, Riley handled the New Jack Swing half. Even though engineers remember the sessions as \"giggly, innocent, and so much fun,\" Jackson did his part to foster a friendly rivalry—bouncing back and forth between studios and taunting his teams, \"Oh boy, they got some smelly jelly going on in there.\"As Sony's deadlines kept getting blown, Riley's beats began forming the spine of the record. After being initially awestruck, Riley asserted more and more control at Jackson's behest. \"It worked itself out when he shook me,\" Riley told HipHopWired in 2009. \"[He was like] listen, you're going to have to really produce me like you've produced a new artist. I need you to talk to me, I need you to criticize me, I need you to comment, I need you to give me all of you. I want the Teddy Riley that got that record out of Guy and the records out of your previous artists.\"If Michael danced in the studio, it meant that a track sounded right. No matter what, Jackson ensured that the melodies were his own, while Riley sought to merge his trademark New Jack Swing with Quincy Jones' baroque pop. At one point, L.A. Reid and Babyface were brought in to help produce, but none of their contributions made the final cut. Over 60 songs wound up being written over a period of 18 months. It cost $10 million in total, not counting video costs.When Jackson revealed the final tracklist to Riley, the latter expected to see his name once or twice. Instead, Riley produced six of the 14 songs—arguably all the material that has aged the best. As a result of his contributions, you can convincingly argue that Dangerous is Jackson's final classic album and the best full-length of the New Jack Swing era.As soon as you pressed play on the tape, Riley's drums attacked with Scud-era force. \"Jam.\" The sound of glass breaking, bells reminiscent of LL Cool J's \"Jingling Baby,\" funky drums that knock like Clyde Stubblefield was behind the kit, and roaring saxophone licks. The words \"you want to get up and jam\" are initially buried in the mix, but the vocals are as acrobatic as a highlight reel, so it only made sense that the Chicago Bulls used it in their 1992 championship video. Starring Michael Jordan and Kris Kross, the \"Jam\" clip became almost as iconic as \"Black or White.\" Filmed in an abandoned rat-infested armory on the South Side of Chicago, it finds Michael Jackson teaching Jordan how to dance and the other MJ teaching him to hoop. Through the wonders of special effects, Jackson ultimately swishes shots that not even Steph Curry can hit; but not even the greatest dancer of the last half-century can teach Jordan how to dance. Point Jackson.Riley recruited Jackson's favorite rapper Heavy D for four nimble bars, his baritone artfully offsetting the singer's falsetto growl. The first song wastes no time in articulating the album's leitmotif. Jackson urges the world to come together, decries false prophets crying of doom, and admits that the universe is a complicated place full of \"tears for fears.\" He's \"conditioned by the system\" and doesn't want to be preached to. His ultimate realization is that you have to \"live each day like it's the last,\" find inner peace to stay strong against the haters, and when in doubt, jam.You can see these themes stressed on nearly every song. \"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\" exists as a mission statement. This is the Michael who fame has isolated and forced into retreat. There's a newfound menace in his voice, an angelic sneer, as he recites a litany of crippling ailments (world hunger, illiteracy, disease, gangs, homelessness, drug addiction, corruption, police brutality)—and yet ironically, he has somehow become the media's bullseye. Written during his 33rd year, Jackson can't help but implicitly compare himself to Jesus—a popular healer who wants to help, misinterpreted and publicly crucified.  But even though Teddy Riley had Jesus, Jesus never had Teddy Riley. These drums could turn stone walls to white sand, the vocals are meticulously layered, the multiple bridges leave just enough room for interpretative dance moves. Jackson adapts seamlessly to the new genre, funkier than Guy, more lyrically incisive than Bobby Brown.Without Madonna, \"In the Closet\" received a cameo from Princess Stephanie of Monaco, mainly because Michael liked her sultry speaking voice even though she couldn't sing. Shot in the desert, the Herb Ritts video stars Naomi Campbell at her pret a porter peak. Michael wears a tank top with a plunging neckline. It's probably the most erotically charged of his career, about as far from \"Thriller\" as Basic Instinct is to The Mask.  You can trace Timbaland and the Neptunes experiments to a song like \"She Drives Me Wild,\" in which their former mentor created the percussion tracks from automotive sounds: car horns, motorcycles idling and revving, vehicles starting and screeching. This is probably Jackson's closest attempt to match his sister's Rhythm Nation.Some interpreted it as a desire to catch up, but it's more emblematic of his lust to conquer. If Off the Wall was Jackson mastering late '70s soul and disco, Thriller was his perfection of '80s pop. This is Jackson showing that he could blend hip-hop and R&B better than anyone had previously imagined. The new decade starts here, with artists like Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, TLC, R. Kelly, et al. taking cues from Jackson and Riley's alchemy. To say nothing of Kanye, Drake, and countless others still atop the charts.Dangerous has its flaws. The ballads on the back (non-Riley) half of the album could pass for gospel renditions of Celine Dion schmaltz. Despite its noble message and Jackson's statement that it was the song he was most proud of writing, \"Heal the World\" is essentially \"We Are The World Pt. 2.\" The theme from Free Willy, \"Will You Be There\" offers a sweet sentiment, but it's not exactly \"I Believe I Can Fly.\" \"Gone Too Soon\" falls into that same category of beautifully intentioned crooning that ultimately sounds like a dentist office doxology, especially when contrasted with the brilliant funk of the first side.If nothing else, they display the full range of his sharply targeted social consciousness, one that encompassed environmentalism, the AIDS pandemic, and every other affliction that still plagues the globe. In that sense, Dangerous might be Jackson's most complete album, spanning dance music to dark nights of the soul. It's a portrait of a persecuted genius, desperate to stay relevant, burdened with guilt and rage, lashing out at villains and offering inspiration to allies—always making it seem effortless.  * * *My favorite song on Dangerous is \"Remember the Time.\" Like so many others on this album, it's inextricable from its video, which also received the MJ treatment: simultaneous premieres on MTV, Fox and BET in February of 1992. Directed by John Singleton, it stars Eddie Murphy, Iman, the Pharcyde, Magic Johnson, Tiny Lister, and some adorable striped tabbies. It's probably the only song from Dangerous that can still go off in any club on any given night.As far as I'm concerned, it's the greatest music video ever made, a New Jack Swing hybrid of Cleopatra and Indiana Jones. There are swirling hourglasses, busts of Pharaohs, hand drums, wriggling snakes, and Michael Jackson as a gilded wizard with dance moves so smooth that he can even elude the future Deebo. He's so cool that steals the Pharaoh's wife (who also happens to be David Bowie's future wife) and then disappears into a cloud of gold dust, just as his capture seems imminent.Being a child of the '80s and '90s meant that Magic Johnson, Eddie Murphy, and Michael Jordan were your heroes. (Maybe you liked Larry Bird or something, but I assume if that's the case, you've long stopped reading this review.) And in his videos, Michael Jackson managed to best them all, making him the undisputed King. For most of my pre-adolescence, he was a pure sorcerer, a demigod immune to the gravitational pull and perimeters that stifle the rest of us.At 10 years old, I assumed the video was shot somewhere in Egypt, because even though I no longer believed in bullshit like Santa Claus, I still accepted Michael Jackson at face value. Besides, nothing else he did seemed like it operated under any budgetary constraint. Only about a year ago did I learn that it was shot at Mack Sennett Studios in Silver Lake, a soundstage across the street from my apartment that I'd obliviously walked past thousands of times. It was one of those depressing realizations that makes much less sense than believing that Michael Jackson built a time machine and brought the star of Beverly Hills Cop, a supermodel, and the best point guard ever, along with him to the time of Ramses the Great. Watch that video again and tell me otherwise.In that same way, it's difficult to listen to Dangerous without considering the child molestation allegations that greeted him shortly after he came home from its marathon 69-concert tour. It's tricky not to read too much into a song like \"In the Closet.\" How do you reconcile that someone as pure of spirit as Jackson could potentially have a monstrous streak?Whether you believe the allegations or not, it's clear that he was never the same after Dangerous. The damage became too absolute, the vitriol aimed his way too severe for someone that sensitive. Never again could his music exist on its own merits, the illimitable genius ravaged by prescription pills, insomnia, and obliterating pressure. Dangerous is the last time that Michael Jackson was Michael Jackson.In an interview given shortly after the release of Dangerous, Jackson said that his goal was to do \"an album that was like Tchaikovsky's ‘Nutcracker Suite.' In a thousand years from now, people would still be listening to it…. Something that would live forever.\" He's been gone for over half a decade, but I still think about this quote every time I walk past that sound stage—considering the possibilities that Michael Jackson unlocked in every song, the infinite magic that he could create out of an empty room, the orphic visions of one of our final myths.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Jeff Weiss, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

That he has never risen above cult status is one of life's little mysteries. This collection spans the early stages of his career, and includes a couple of his best original compositions, \"It Don't Bother Me\" and the harrowing heroin ballad \"Needle of Death,\" as well as some well-chosen covers, including his take on Jackson C. Frank's \"Blues Run the Game\" and a near-definitive version of Davy Graham's classic instrumental \"Angie.\" Jansch's commercial high watermark came with Pentangle, a folk/jazz quintet he formed with fellow guitar virtuoso John Renbourn at the close of the 1960s, and a single live track from the group is collected here, the moody and stirring \"Bruton Town.\" Another highlight finds Renbourn joining Jansch for a wonderful twin acoustic guitar rendition of Charles Mingus' \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.\" There are several Jansch anthologies on the market, most of which contain pretty much the tracks you'll find here, so this works as well as any as an introduction. Castle's two-disc Dazzling Stranger might make the best choice, however, since it includes most of these cuts, plus a selection of his later work, as well.</p> <p>&mdash; <strong>Steve Leggett</strong></p>"

Presumably, they did it in order not to distract attention from Nude Ants, which was recorded a week after these concerts, but that never stopped them before from just piling on more discs. In any case, these Tokyo recordings were too good to hide; the quartet had reached an interactive creative high around this time, often burning at the rarified level that Nude Ants reached. Jarrett is both lyrically effusive and able to ignite his European colleagues into giving him more swinging support than on earlier sessions. In particular, the title track has a lot of the exploratory fervor of \"New Dance\" from Nude Ants, and \"Late Night Willie\" gets down deep into the Jarrett gospel feeling. Jan Garbarek is especially forthright in Tokyo on tenor, while his soprano pierces like a beam of sunlight, and Palle Danielsson (bass) and Jon Christensen (drums) are loose, relaxed, and impeccably recorded. Clearly this is one of the peaks of the European quartet's discography.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b></p>"

In addition to Jarrett's \"So Tender,\" there are such superior songs explored on this date as Alec Wilder's \"Moon and Sand,\" \"If I Should Lose You\" and \"I Fall in Love Too Easily.\" Bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette listen closely to Jarrett and no matter what direction the pianist turns, they are already there waiting for him.</p>&mdash;<b>Scott Yanow</b>"

Immensely popular, Jefferson's 78s were poorly pressed and frequently played, so these tracks have a good deal of surface hiss, which may be bothersome to some listeners.</p><p> &mdash; <b>Steve Leggett</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>When Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons released Screaming Targets in late 1979 it pushed them into the premier league. They'd already established themselves as one of the greatest pub-rocking acts of the day, having slogged around the touring circuit for over three years. Unfortunately, their first two albums hadn't sold very well but they finally made a chart impact when the 1978 single 'So Young' hit the Top 30. The perfect break-through act (to use some kind of industry parlance) was just about to hit the crest of the music wave.<p>And Screaming Targets did not disappoint – it was exceedingly accomplished, with a tough but accessible production sound courtesy of English producer Pete Solley and full of absolutely first-rate songs. The band's funky and energetic mix of R&B and soul had already done the job but it was when singer Joe Camilleri infused the music with a large dose of reggae rhythms that the hit singles arrived: 'Hit And Run' and 'Shape I'm In'. The album also caught the New Wave mood of the times with such outstanding album tracks as 'Don't Wanna Come Down', 'Close To The Bone', 'Thin Line' and Paul Kelly's 'Only The Lonely Hearted'. Elvis Costello would have killed to have written some of those riffs; in fact he must have been listening closely because he went on to record a version of 'So Young'.<p>The initial pressing of the album came with a bonus, limited edition live album of material recorded in Melbourne during April 1979. This was the band playing at the top of its game, featuring swampy and rockin' covers of 'Security', 'Not A Woman, Not A Child' and 'Mona', matched by 'So Young' and the 10-minute progressive rock epic 'The Cthulhu'. All are present and correct on Disc One of this collection.<p>I'd often been puzzled in the past when occasionally Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons would be compared to the Rolling Stones. After listening to Disc One non-stop for a couple of days… I get it now! Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons were out-Stonesing the Stones by a mile at the time. Man, these guys could rock – and of course the rhythm section of bassist John Power and drummer Gary Young was one of the tightest in the land. Add the high-tensile, interlocking guitar riffs of Jeff Burstin and Tony Faehse and the wailing sax lines of Camilleri and brother-in-crime Wilbur Wilde and you have an iconic band up there with the best throughout the history of Aussie rock.<p>Disc Two (entitled The Rhythm & Blues) keeps up the pace but not surprisingly it ranges all over the place, mixing previously unreleased demos (from 1976 up to the 2003 Ricochet album) with a whole raft of live cuts. It is staggering to consider that such incredible tracks as 'The Rhythm & Blues' (the band sounding like Rose Tattoo!), 'Rock It', 'Fix It Up', 'Hard Luck Story' and 'Ain't Got No Money' have never seen the light of day before.<p>Another rarity here is 'Glad I'm Living Here', taken from the original movie soundtrack to Oz: A Rock 'n' Roll Road Movie (1976). Which begs the question: where is the only other Mushroom rarity, the cover of Chuck Berry's 'Run, Rudolph, Run' (and its B-side for that matter, 'Guess Who') produced by Ross Wilson, issued as a single in 1975 and credited to Jo Jo Zep and His Little Helpers? David Laing described 'Run, Rudolph, Run' as “only a novelty song” but I see it as a missed opportunity on an otherwise fabulous release.<p><strong>&mdash;Ian McFarlane</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p><I>Duke Elegant</I> certainly wasn't the only tribute to <a href=\"javascript:z('Bqbaxlffe5cqe')\">Duke Ellington</a> put out in honor of the 100th anniversary of the legendary bandleader, nor was it even the first time Dr. John had tackled his material. But it would be hard to find a better homage than this one. Dr. John proves a surprisingly good match for Ellington's material, placing a tremendously funky foundation under the composer's tunes. The sound is dominated by the good doctor's incomparable New Orleans piano and organ, naturally, and the best tracks are those whose melodies are carried solely by his keyboard work, such as instrumentals \"Caravan\" and \"Things Ain't What They Used to Be.\" The vocal cuts are fine &mdash; his takes on the Ellington ballad \"Solitude\" and especially the dreamy, elegant \"Mood Indigo\" show off Dr. John's uniquely expressive voice as well as any of his early-era recordings &mdash; though he occasionally tends to approach self-caricature, as on \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing).\" Any weakness, however, is more than made up for by the closing rearrangement of \"Flaming Sword,\" one of three Ellington rarities here. Dr. John transforms the instrumental into a luminous, gorgeously melodic display of Professor Longhair-style piano over an astonishingly sexy New Orleans funk rhythm. Ultimately, <I>Duke Elegant</I> holds up both as an innovative twist on the Ellington songbook and as a solid Dr. John album in its own right.</p><p> &mdash; <B> Kenneth Bays</B> &mdash; AllMusic</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mac \"Dr. John\" Rebennack playing songs from the canon of <A href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/17834/002-9958316-7028034\">Duke Ellington</A> is as natural as the break of day. But the gris-gris king interprets Ellington in a way unlike anyone else. \"Mood Indigo,\" arranged for Dr. John's six-man New Orleans group, takes on a fresh, heartfelt immediacy with the good doctor's vocals and piano locked into a relaxed groove. He sings another slice of essential Ellingtonia, \"Do Nothing 'til You Hear from Me,\" with a lighthearted nonchalance that epitomizes the worthiest New Orleans performers. Dr. John  packages snippets of his keyboard playing as panaceas for the soul on a funked-up interpretation of \"Caravan,\" even spinning off on a \"Wade in the Water\" tangent before wrapping up the song. But with so many, many Ellington nuggets to dust off for reinterpretation, one wonders why Dr. John elected to go with popularnumbers that get covered again and again. To his credit, he does serve up the lesser-known \"The Flaming Sword,\" where his piano is luminous in the Calypso fashion of Professor Longhair, and he offers delightful, fonkified updates of the Ellington obscurities \"On the Wrong Side of the Railroad Tracks\" and \"I'm Gonna Go Fishin'.\"</p><p> &mdash;<I>Frank-John Hadley</I> &mdash; AllMusic</p>"

Musically, it's Mac in his laid-back mode, but the band crackles a fair bit throughout. The centerpiece of this seven-track set is the \"Wade: Hurricane Suite\" consisting of the old spiritual \"Wade in the Water,\" improvised and extrapolated into four parts revisiting the levee breaks, storms, and catastrophes that have visited the Crescent City since history has been written. Mac plays his best jazz piano and organ as it has been influenced by deep blues, second line and old-school gospel and funk. The band, which includes John Fohl on guitar, bassist David Barard, and drummer Herman Everest II, sits tights with Mac's strolling and sometimes dramatic groove. The tunes are fine though the production feels sterile, too clean for the music, and that's a drawback. One would have liked to hear this band stretch out more and really click in a rawer setting on the suite because the blues are so prevalent in its construction and ripe for improvisation. But this mini album was recorded in New York and not at home, as has been his wont for a few years now. That's not to say that Sippiana Hericane is a disappointment, but it's not fully satisfactory either. The heartbreak and desperation are pervasive, but the rave-up sections don't quite climb out on the limb or out of the emotional basement either. The dissonance on \"Storm Surge,\" is wonderful, as each player follows Mac's lead into some angular yet no less vamp-based playing. The record feels ambivalent throughout, and perhaps it should, because the grief is genuine, but the rage that is touched on here, as well as the hope for a New Orleans that will be back \"twice as strong,\" feels reined in, and not allowed its full expression.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>Reading about the power inherent in Robert Johnson's music is one thing, but actually experiencing it is another matter entirely. The official 1998 edition of the original 1961 album was certainly worth the wait, remastered off the best-quality original 78s available, of far superior quality to any of the source materials used on even the 1991 box set. Johnson's guitar takes on a fullness never heard on previous reissues, and except for a nagging hiss in spots on \"Terraplane Blues\" (the equalization on this disc is extreme to even sport some minute turntable rumble in the low end), this really brings his music alive. If there is such a thing as a greatest-hits package available on Johnson, this landmark album, which jump-started the whole '60s blues revival, would certainly be the one. The majority of Johnson's best-known tunes, the ones that made the legend, are all aboard: \"Crossroads,\" \"Walkin' Blues,\" \"Me & The Devil Blues,\" \"Come On In My Kitchen,\" and the apocalyptic visions contained in \"Hellhound On My Trail\" are the blues at its finest, the lyrics sheer poetry. And making its first appearance anywhere is a newly discovered-in-1998 alternate take of \"Traveling Riverside Blues\" that's appended to the original 16-track lineup. If you are starting your blues collection from the ground up, be sure to make this your very first purchase.</p>&mdash; <b>Cub Koda</b>"

The problems aren't in the music itself, of course, which is stunning and the fidelity of the recordings is the best it ever has been or ever will be. Instead, it's in the track sequencing. As the title implies, <i>The Complete Recordings</i> contains all of Johnson's recorded material, including a generous selection of alternate takes. All of the alternates are sequenced directly after the master, which can make listening to the album a little intimidating and tedious for novices. Certainly, the alternates can be programmed out with a CD player, but the set would have been more palatable if the alternate takes were presented on a separate disc. Nevertheless, this is a minor complaint -- Robert Johnson's music retains its power no matter what context it is presented in. He, without question, deserves this kind of deluxe box-set treatment.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Even if B.B. King is the King of the Blues, some might find it strange that he chose to record <I>Let the Good Times Roll</I>, a tribute album to Louis Jordan, the King of Jump Blues. King's work was never as boisterous or enthusiastic as Jordan's, but his debt is apparent from the first cut of the album. King may have never done straight jump blues, but his sophisticated urban blues — complete with horn sections and an emphasis on vocals — shows as much jump influence as it does Delta.</p><p><I>Let the Good Times Roll</I> brings that home with a quiet, seductive insistence. Backed by a stellar band — featuring <A href=\"javascript:z('Bos820rnac48p')\">Dr. John</A> on piano, drummer Earl Palmer, alto saxophonist Hank Crawford, and tenor saxophonist Dave \"Fathead\" Newman, among others — B.B. King sounds loose and natural. There are stars in the band, but this is hardly a bloated all-star effort, since the focus in on delivering no-nonsense performances. Strangely enough, King doesn't play that much guitar on the album, concentrating on his vocals and letting the band interact. When he does solo, it's as elegant and tasteful as always, but the focal point is always the songs. Since he's such a fine guitarist, B.B.'s singing often goes underappreciated, but here it's at the forefront, and he shines. His phrasing is impeccable, and he always captures the spirit of the songs, either through humor or heart. Of course, that's a skill that Jordan had, as well, and realizing that sheds new light on B.B.'s music. Much of his celebrated skills as a showman and a performer indirectly came from Jordan, as did elements of his musical style. Never has that been as clear as it is on <I>Let the Good Times Roll</I>.</p><p>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B> -- AllMusic</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Albums consisting entirely of one artist paying tribute to another arecommonplace, especially in the blues world where a particular artist'smusical heritage is easy to trace. It's rare, though, for an artist ofB.B. King's caliber to do such a tribute, and we're all lucky that theartist he chose to honor is Louis Jordan--the King of the Blues saluting the King of Swing. King'sclean, expressive guitar style and rough-hewn voice are so distinctivethat there's no mistaking them for anyone else's, and hearing them appliedto Jordan's classic songs--including \"Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens,\"\"Somebody Done Changed the Lock on My Door,\" \"Saturday Night Fish Fry,\"and \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\"--demonstrates both King'sconsiderable skill and the great versatility of Jordan's songwriting. Thatmakes this record more than a mere curiosity, as does the stellar pianowork from another living legend, <A href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ts/artist-glance/34011/002-9958316-7028034\">Dr. John</A>.</p> <p>--<b>Genevieve Williams</b> -- CDNow</p>"

Despite the broad scope of Essential, it's inevitable that some classics are missing -- naturally more on the second Songwriter disc, which offers merely a sampling of the many great songs she penned, whereas all her big hits (\"I Feel the Earth Move,\" \"So Far Away,\" \"It's Too Late,\" \"You've Got a Friend,\" \"Jazzman\") save the inexplicably missing \"Smackwater Jack\" are on the first -- but this does contain the lion's share of her major songs as both a singer and songwriter, making it the best overview of her work released to date.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

This album was billed as a Knopfler solo album rather than an original soundtrack album, with the notation \"music...for the film.\" Knopfler brings along Dire Straits associates Alan Clark (keyboards) and John Illsley (bass), plus session aces like saxophonist Mike Brecker, vibes player Mike Mainieri, and drummers Steve Jordan and Terry Williams. The low-key music picks up traces of Scottish music, but most of it just sounds like Dire Straits doing instrumentals, especially the recurring theme, one of Knopfler's more memorable melodies. Gerry Rafferty (remember him from \"Baker Street\"?) sings the one vocal selection, \"That's the Way It Always Starts.\" </P><P>— <B>William Ruhlmann</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>Mark Knopfler's now produced more studio albums as a solo artist, than he did with the band that he will forever be remembered for, Dire Straits. Discounting various soundtracks and side projects, his seventh solo outing Privateering is an ambitious double record that continues his latter day purple patch. Equal helpings of Celtic inspired folk, traditional blues, country, and that Geordie sense of humour, make the 20 tracks here less of a marathon, and more a stroll down memory lane.</p><p>It's also clear that the break in recording to join a European leg of Bob Dylan's Never Ending Tour, helped to galvanise the material. There's a loose theme about life on the road to be found, signalled by the historic naval roots of the album title itself. The act of Privateering was to join the crew of a privately owned vessel to aid the state during wartime. A modern interpretation of that could well be to join a band and make a stand against the world around you.</p><p>It seems that is Knopfler's intention here as some gentle political commentary occasionally bubbles to the surface (The cash in hand scraping by of 'Corned Beef City' springs to mind.). Even the album cover of a beaten up van suggests a touring mentality, and a brief glimpse of the track listing indicates an ever-changing landscape (for example 'Redbud Tree' and 'Seattle'). With a six night stint booked at the Royal Albert Hall next year, it seems that Knopfler is also very at home on tour, and Privateering will serve well to bolster an already expansive set list for those shows.</p><p>One of the standout tracks 'Radio City Serenade' starts with one of the most memorable lyrics from the record; \"You've got to have no credit cards, to know how good it feels\". Knopfler is pining for a more simple time as trumpets, guitars and violins create a bustling cityscape in his ode to New York. Elsewhere a character from a Dire Straits song seems to have been given a blues makeover. 'Hot Or Not' has that swaggering almost spoken vocal delivery that Knopfler first used on 'My Parties' (which can be found on Dire Straits' final album On Every Street). But here, instead of a comment on yuppie culture, he re-imagines the protagonist as a Mississippi delta gambler on a winning streak (\"I'll read 'em like a book. Let's go have a drink or two and talk about the scalps I took.\"). With a traditional blues backing complete with harmonica and piano it's the perfect atmosphere for Knopfler to pull out one of his trademark solos too.</p><p>That's perhaps the point of Privateering, no matter where Knopfler takes the listener on his whistle stop tour of musical styles, his unique guitar picking is never far away. While some of the lyrics are world weary and tinged with regret, there's a certain joy to be found in his chameleonic guitar playing. Knopfler's also put together a very versatile band which shares the spotlight on many occasions. He may well be the captain of this ship, but it's his crew that keep it on course. While those hoping that Knopfler may be heading back to safer waters may be disappointed here, he's embraced roots music wholeheartedly and with some real success.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Jim Pusey.</strong></p>"

In the reissue, Kuepper notes how he and drummer Mark Dawson wanted to avoid \"the usual 'doing the greatest hits acoustically' routine,\" and in a series of rehearsals for a tour start tried other approaches with newer songs or cover versions. Dawson himself plays a stripped-down set -- partially using a cardboard box -- while Kuepper uses a variety of unexpected tunings on his guitar, as well as using his familiar, rich voice. The end result's a beauty of a record, captured well on tape with just enough echo (Kuepper semi-jokingly calls the effect \"ambient rockabilly,\" and certainly on songs like \"Always the Woman Pays\" it could be the Durutti Column at Sun Studios). One of Kuepper's all-time classics, \"Everything I've Got Belongs to You,\" made its first bow here, the killer opening line, \"I've designs on you that come from dirty books\" still a winner, while an earlier sample of his brilliance, the Saints' \"Eternally Yours,\" also takes a bow. Covers include Tim Hardin's \"If I Were a Carpenter\" and the title track, actually a medley with Donovan and the Animals adding to Kuepper's original, while self-penned highlights include \"What You Don't Know,\" with a nervous, dramatic edge, and the gentler-paced but not-less-commanding \"There's Nothing Natural.\" The radio-set extras add even more of a frenetic charge to the more commanding songs -- \"Always the Woman Pays\" practically leaps out at the listener and \"Pretty Mary\" isn't far behind.</p>&mdash; <b>Ned Raggett</b>"

		"review": "<p>In 1988, Stompin' Tom Connors, the most fiercely patriotic Canadian musician to ever take the stage in the land of the Maple Leaf, wrote a song in tribute to fellow Canadian k.d. lang for continuing to hang her hat in Alberta after enjoying a commercial breakthrough in the United States. It's hard to say what Stompin' Tom thinks about lang these days, now that she's an out-of-the-closet lesbian, an animal rights activist, and (gulp) spending most of her time in America, but it's a good bet he approves of Hymns of the 49th Parallel, in which lang turns her attention exclusively to the work of Canadian tunesmiths. Anchored by classic songs from Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen (all of whom rate two songs each), Hymns of the 49th Parallel is not so much a flag-waving celebration of Canada as an appreciation of the often spare and evocative style of its best-known lyricists (or at least that's the case with the material on board), and lang and frequent collaborator Ben Mink have matched the selections with production and arrangements that are simple and to the point, with only a piano/bass/drums trio for accompaniment (though a string section pops in every once in a while). With her phrasing subdued and her projection scaled back from the big-as-all-outdoors sound of her early days, lang seems to have kept her own instrument in check as well, though her best moments still inspire a very real awe. Though lang has chosen some superb songs (and written a fine one herself in the album's only original, \"Simple\") and performed them with obvious love and affection, Hymns of the 49th Parallel seems oddly lacking in passion; perhaps in deference to the frozen North, this album has a cool and frosty undertow that seems designed to hold the listener at arm's length, despite the inarguable beauty of its craft. Perhaps for the follow-up, she should bring in Stompin' Tom for a duet on \"The Hockey Song\" to liven things up.</i>&mdash; <b>Mark Deming </b>"

		"review": "<p>Led Zeppelin had a fully formed, distinctive sound from the outset, as their eponymous debut illustrates. Taking the heavy, distorted electric blues of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, and Cream to an extreme, Zeppelin created a majestic, powerful brand of guitar rock constructed around simple, memorable riffs and lumbering rhythms. But the key to the group's attack was subtlety: it wasn't just an onslaught of guitar noise; it was shaded and textured, filled with alternating dynamics and tempos. As Led Zeppelin proves, the group was capable of such multi-layered music from the start. Although the extended psychedelic blues of \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"You Shook Me,\" and \"I Can't Quit You Baby\" often gather the most attention, the remainder of the album is a better indication of what would come later. \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\" shifts from folky verses to pummeling choruses; \"Good Times Bad Times\" and \"How Many More Times\" have groovy, bluesy shuffles; \"Your Time Is Gonna Come\" is an anthemic hard rocker; \"Black Mountain Side\" is pure English folk; and \"Communication Breakdown\" is a frenzied rocker with a nearly punkish attack. Although the album isn't as varied as some of their later efforts, it nevertheless marked a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal.</p><p>[Led Zeppelin launched a massive reissue campaign in 2014, supervised by Jimmy Page. The album proper has been remastered but the centerpiece for this deluxe edition, as it is for its companion reissues, is an additional disc of unreleased bonus material. Page dug through the Zeppelin archives to find rare -- and often un-bootlegged -- recordings, relying on alternate mixes and backing tracks but occasionally excavating unheard songs. However, the music contained on the deluxe edition of Led Zeppelin does not fall into these categories. The entire disc of bonus material is dedicated to a concert given at the Olympia in Paris in 1969, right between the recordings of the debut LP and Led Zeppelin II. This tape has been bootlegged before; indeed, it came to Page's attention relatively recently -- somewhere between the release of Mothership and Celebration Day -- and it was e-mailed to him by a fan. What's presented here is edited slightly from that version -- \"How Many More Years\" suffers the most, cut from its original 20 minutes by nearly ten minutes, and there are slices made to the guitar solo on \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Moby Dick\" has been truncated -- but most listeners won't much care because what's presented is so powerful. Often, the group drifts into endless jams -- \"Dazed and Confused\" clocks in at 15 minutes, \"You Shook Me\" at nearly 12 -- but this never seems ponderous, possibly because it opens with a version of \"Good Times Bad Times\" that the group quickly abandons for an insanely fast \"Communication Breakdown,\" playing it as if they were sprinting to the finish. It's not tight but that's its appeal, as it shows how the band was a vital, living beast, playing differently on-stage than they did in the studio. This is also true of the liquid psychedelia of their blues -- they never miss an opportunity to sink into an endless groove but there's a kineticism to the interplay that almost always prevents it from seeming ponderous (the exception is, as ever, \"Moby Dick,\" whose success relies entirely on your personal taste for drum solos). Zeppelin never felt this nervy again: they harnessed their majesty and knew how to deploy it, but here it still seems like they weren't quite sure of their limits, which is why it's a particularly exciting bonus disc.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine - 2015</strong></p><p>As time moves on and \"The 60s\" and \"The 70s\" become not so much historical periods as media creations, it's harder to take for granted what the significant cultural touchstones of those eras actually mean to current-day society. Some of the artists that were once universally appreciated are slipping from memory, while others are having difficulty translating to new generations. The furor greeting each new Beatles enterprise shows their music and image are indeed proving timeless, and they remain relevant for teenagers and septuagenarians alike&mdash;but other giants from the late 1960s and early 70s aren't having it so easy. The Who's stock has plummeted in the last decade, and it's getting tougher to find anyone under 35 who cares about a note of their music made after 1971. The Rolling Stones have been at it so long that it's difficult for younger people to believe that they were once actually good. Pink Floyd still reach some alienated kids, but their most devoted fans are among the graybeard audiophile set. And then there's Led Zeppelin.</p><p>Zeppelin occupies a unique place among this group of bands, in part because their position was hard to pin down while they were active. They were unimaginably popular from 1969 to 1980, but critical respect was elusive. Their suspect reputation has been somewhat overstated (in the U.S., Rolling Stone panned them early on but eventually came around, while Creem and Circus took them seriously all along) but Led Zeppelin never quite registered with the intelligentsia. They made the heaviest hard rock records ever recorded, but their lyrics tended toward loopy mysticism when they weren't either stealing ideas outright or wallowing in a kind of hedonism where misogyny was a given.</p><p>In 2014, Led Zeppelin is typically viewed through one of three lenses: those among the 50-plus set who were actually there hear their music with a nostalgic ear, remembering the days of their youth. There are those who grew up with the assumption that Led Zeppelin were important&mdash;let's say 30 to 50 years old&mdash;hear them filtered through a second wave of nostalgia, from movie titles like Dazed and Confused and the memory of classic rock radio. To these people (including me), Zeppelin defined an otherworldly image of '70s rock deities, conquering the world on the strength of volume, arena shows, and the baddest riffs the world had ever heard. And then there's the younger set for whom Zep might seem a little comical, a faintly embarrassing relic from another era even as a certain amount of the music remains undeniable. In one sense, this latter group have more in common with the skeptical critics of the first wave, possessing expectations of \"what music should be\" that don't necessarily apply for a band that sounds like this.</p><p>These reissues of Zeppelin's first three albums are an attempt to reach all of these people, using every tool at the band and label's disposal. The primary reason these sets are being presented and received as a Big Deal is that they are the first reissues of the digital era (and here I'm using the term to include CDs, which means we're going back more than 30 years) to include bonus material. The reissues are remastered and are packaged with bonus discs that include previously unreleased live material and studio cuts. The PR push surrounding a big reissue in 2014 inevitably involves sharing things that can spread on social media and hence reach younger kids, while other elements&mdash;unheard versions, improved sound&mdash;ostensibly entice older fans to re-buy the records.</p><p>Jimmy Page, always Led Zeppelin's sonic architect, heard the blues differently. He heard it as sound first, rather than a form or tradition or product of personalities&mdash;maybe that's why he felt so cavalier about \"borrowing\" from blues records without attribution, since you can't copyright a sound&mdash;and he understood the trance-inducing element of blues repetition better than anyone: blues as a consciousness-expanding ritual. All of this is clear from the very beginning, as Led Zeppelin is one of music's most assured and fully realized debuts; individually, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were great players, but the whole of their sound somehow exceeded the sum of its parts. But even above the instrumental virtuosity, Led Zeppelin is a triumph of production, each part clear and forceful but adding up to something even more powerful.</p><p>Just about everything Zep would do at one point is presented here somewhere&mdash;trance-rock (\"Dazed and Confused\"), gorgeous acoustic folk (\"Black Mountain Side\"), catchy guitar pop (\"Good Times Bad Times\"), updates on straight blues (\"I Can't Quit You Baby\"). They'd do most of these things better later, but this is where they appeared first. Zep sounded so brilliant right out of the gate because Page was already a veteran of the music scene when they started; working as a session guitarist and later with the Yardbirds, he took in the scene and saw what was missing. As much as Zeppelin understood music, at this point words were more or less just sounds.</p><p>Led Zeppelin also set the tone for a decade of dippy lyrics. If Zep was never accepted as hip in some circles, it's partly because of the knuckle-dragging worldview of songs like \"Dazed and Confused\". It's hard not to laugh or cringe in 2014 when hearing a line like \"Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay/ Try and love you baby but you push me away,\" but it's equally difficult not to acknowledge that Robert Plant delivers them with a certain histrionic power. And then a bar later, John Bonham's slow fills and Page's terrifying guitar screech come in, and the true meaning of the music is found.</p><p>It's truly impossible to oversell how brilliantly these records are produced; \"rock\" as an idea is really a '70s idea, and Led Zeppelin established what that would mean and what it would sound like, which was as much a matter of arrangement as it was knowing where to set the microphones, how high to mix the bass. You can hear that on the bonus disc to the first album, which was recorded live in Paris in 1969 and aired on radio. The recording fidelity, for a release by such a major band, is remarkably poor&mdash;which goes to show how well the vaults have already been cleared out&mdash;but there's no doubting just how much this band could rip in their first year. Of particular note is the attack of Plant's singing, as he comes over like the unhinged 22-year-old he was. The earliest live recordings by bands are so exciting in large part because the vocalist hasn't yet learned how to pace himself; Plant sings these songs like Zeppelin might last a year and this is his one chance to get it right. By the late '70s, purely as a matter of survival, he'd learn how to coast on stage.</p><p>There is no arguing with a riff. It's a conversation-ender, something resistant to analysis that strips away the intellectual to situate the music in a purely physical space. Of the 100 greatest guitar riffs in the history of rock music, Jimmy Page might have written 20, and a good number of those can be found on Led Zeppelin's second album from 1969. If you or someone close to you has ever been within 10 feet of a radio tuned to a classic rock station, you've heard them all, many times&mdash;maybe too many. For every young person who discovers \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\", there's an older person who gets sick of them from overplay and doesn't need to ever hear them again. Part of the challenge and excitement of revisiting a record upon reissue is trying to hear the music again with fresh ears, seeing if you can tap into that feeling of discovery that came from hearing it the first time. When I'm able to mentally put myself into this place&mdash; the kid who got his driver's license a month ago, driving around listening to II on tape&mdash;the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever.</p><p>Every track on this record is musically brilliant, and in the span of just a few months it's amazing how much Page had enriched the band's sound. Chiming acoustic guitars provide the contrast to the crunch in a whole new way on \"Ramble On\" and \"Thank You\", offering yet another template for mixing folk with proto-metal. \"Whole Lotta Love\" might have gotten the band sued by Willie Dixon, but there was no sonic precedent for it in rock music&mdash;it's a sound that would have been unimaginable without the rise of drug culture. If you are not a drummer, it's hard to imagine listening to \"Moby Dick\" very often, but better evidence of John Bonham's genius is found elsewhere on the record. Zep's rhythmic underpinning, especially the locked-in tandem of Jones and Bonham, was always their secret weapon, the thing that divided them from contemporaries like Black Sabbath. They could swing, they loved James Brown and Motown, and they took pride in the fact that people would dance at their shows. The bonus disc is a mildly interesting amalgam of alternate mixes and rough takes&mdash;the kind of stuff anyone but the most dedicated obsessives will listen to only once&mdash;and there's little advance here lyrically from the debut, but II is still close to perfect.</p><p>III is, indirectly, Led Zeppelin's own version of Pink Floyd's Meddle&mdash;the folky, pretty early record that was never too popular and hence a favorite of indie types skeptical of such a massive mainstream band. That it opens with \"Immigrant Song\", one of their top few rockers, only makes the later acoustic loveliness that much more affecting. The strings laid atop the acoustic guitar on \"Friends\" foreshadow \"Kashmir\"; \"Tangerine\" has an amazing tension between the minor-key verses and the open, joyous chorus, as good an example of any of Zep as a pop band. The melancholy ache of \"That's the Way\" is Zep with their guard down&mdash;it goes down as easy as a great Cat Stevens song&mdash;and then by the end of the record things start to get a little weird, with the heavy acoustic hoedown of \"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\" and the acid-fried chug of the blues standard \"Shake 'em on Down\", a nod to the hypnotic one-chord version by Mississippi Fred McDowell. III has easily the best bonus material too, including a fantastic unreleased version of the old blues song \"Keys to the Highway\". Depending on your age, you might remember III as \"the one with the Viking kittens song\" or \"the one with that pretty song that played during an interlude of Almost Famous\"; for someone who doesn't necessarily want to be inundated with songs and riffs that became clichés, it might be the best place to start.</p><p>For some, the interest in these sets is the remastering, an alleged improvement in sound, which makes sense for a band so song-oriented. I've always thought that Zeppelin, like Neil Young, were best heard from nice-sounding pressings from the '70s that were utterly ubiquitous in used LP bins in the '80s and '90s. Back then, you could collect the entire Zeppelin catalog for something like $30, where the inferior sounding early CD masters would run you more like $150.</p><p>These days the gap between different versions seems to be closing. I attended a listening session for these reissues in New York, hosted by Jimmy Page, and at one point he was asked which version sounded best, vinyl or CD. Page responded with saying the best version was the original analog tape, but \"unfortunately I can't invite you all 'round to listen to it.\" Suffice to say that these remasters sound very good, a bit louder but not overly so, but we're likely reaching a point of diminishing returns. That said, I'm very glad these new remasters and the attendant publicity push exist, to get us all listening to and talking about Led Zeppelin again, where they stand and what they might mean. However you feel about them and their brand of ultra-huge arena rock, there has never been another band like them, before or since.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Since the group could only enter the studio for brief amounts of time, most of the songs that compose II are reworked blues and rock &amp; roll standards that the band was performing on-stage at the time. Not only did the short amount of time result in a lack of original material, it made the sound more direct. Jimmy Page still provided layers of guitar overdubs, but the overall sound of the album is heavy and hard, brutal and direct. \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"The Lemon Song,\" and \"Bring It on Home\" are all based on classic blues songs -- only, the riffs are simpler and louder and each song has an extended section for instrumental solos. Of the remaining six songs, two sport light acoustic touches (\"Thank You,\" \"Ramble On\"), but the other four are straight-ahead heavy rock that follows the formula of the revamped blues songs. While Led Zeppelin II doesn't have the eclecticism of the group's debut, it's arguably more influential. After all, nearly every one of the hundreds of Zeppelin imitators used this record, with its lack of dynamics and its pummeling riffs, as a blueprint.</P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B>"

		"review": "<p>Led Zeppelin's BBC sessions were among the most popular bootleg items of the rock & roll era, appearing on a myriad of illegal records and CDs. They were all the more popular because of the lack of official Led Zeppelin live albums, especially since The Song Remains the Same failed to capture the essence of the band. For anyone who hadn't heard the recordings, the mystique of Zeppelin's BBC sessions was somewhat mystifying, but the official 1997 release of the double-disc BBC Sessions offered revelations for any fan who hadn't yet heard this music. While some collectors will be dismayed by the slight trimming on the \"Whole Lotta Love Medley,\" almost all of the group's sessions are included here, and they prove why live Zeppelin was the stuff of legend. The 1969 sessions, recorded shortly after the release of the first album, are fiery and dynamic, outstripping the studio record for sheer power. Early versions of \"You Shook Me,\" \"Communication Breakdown,\" \"What Is and What Should Never Be,\" and \"Whole Lotta Love\" hit harder than their recorded counterparts, while covers of Sleepy John Estes' \"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair,\" Robert Johnson's \"Travelling Riverside Blues,\" and Eddie Cochran's \"Something Else\" are welcome additions to the Zeppelin catalog, confirming their folk, blues, and rockabilly roots as well as their sense of vision. Zeppelin's grand vision comes into sharper relief on the second disc, which is comprised of their 1971 sessions. They still have their primal energy, but they're more adventurous, branching out into folk, twisted psychedelia, and weird blues-funk. Certainly, BBC Sessions is the kind of album that will only appeal to fans, but anyone who's ever doubted Zeppelin's power or vision will be set straight with this record.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Maybe you're the person who hasn't quite made up their mind up about Led Zeppelin. That's fine but fair warning, the band is the apotheosis of overstuffed arena rock, from private jets to strong-arming managers to personal excess in every musical, sexual, and philosophical front. Lester Bangs wanted to chuck pies at them in defense of Truth and/or Iggy Pop. Hammer of the Gods depicted them as decadent goons and tried to make that seem admirable. Yo La Tengo's \"Sugarcube\" video, without even needing to name them, reduced their lyrical and aesthetic sensibilities to an interest in \"where the hobbits dwell.\" If you're a young music head who shuns rockism, appropriation, and womanizing as loathsome retrograde traits to be avoided, being into Zep means your faves don't come more problematic.</p><p>Still, rock dorks were tangling with this issue long before any of us, and in the context of reckoning with Led Zeppelin&mdash;especially as an oft-bootlegged yet still elusive live-band document&mdash;the official two-disc release of *BBC Sessions *in 1997 felt like a moment of clarity. Rhino's 2016 reissue of the *BBC Sessions *is also a big important musical-legacy package deal, and justifiably so: Jimmy Page supervised a new remaster in the spirit of the studio album reissues that commenced two years ago, there's an additional third disc that includes an unearthed performance that hadn't been heard since its original 1969 broadcast, Dave Lewis' contextual liner notes are informative and revelatory, and if you just love black-and-white photos of arcane recording gear and empty performance halls, you're in luck. But above all that, it's an exhaustive look at the lengths Led Zeppelin would go to for a chance to make it big through sheer force of music, and it's borne out by witnessing the band in the process their own self-creation.</p><p>Aside from Jimi Hendrix, a few jazzy UK prog bands, and the artists in the orbit of Miles Davis' electric period, nobody working at deconstructing rock‘n'roll took such advantage of the possibilities of improvisation. To know Zeppelin as musicians puts that into focus: Jimmy Page flourished as an ex-session guitarist who still wanted to try any style as his own. John Bonham was so in the pocket even the fractions between the one and the two sounded deep. John Paul Jones strode with purpose along the border between groove's backbone and a nomadic soloist whether on bass or keys. And Robert Plant's voice could wring a Valhallan catharsis out of reading the cooking instructions on a box of macaroni. In isolation they were great; as an ensemble they were supernatural. It's not that they were merely shredding or otherwise showing off: Led Zeppelin wanted to find out where those sounds they built, borrowed, and stole could really go.</p><p>The first disc of *BBC Sessions *covers a stretch from early March to early August of 1969, a couple months after the release of their self-titled debut and a few before they dropped Led Zeppelin II. It seems wrong to call such a short stretch of time between first and second albums a \"transitional period,\" but that's what these sessions capture. The churning, riff-splintering heavy blues-rock of their debut is already shoving against the confines of what they'd already put to tape. They do their damnedest to wring new vistas from old Willie Dixon numbers on \"You Shook Me\" and \"I Can't Quit You Baby,\" and there are moments where everything converges in waves of virtuosity that hint at picking up where the soon-to-disband Cream left off in the blues-rock supergroup sweepstakes. It's when they stretch their legs on \"Dazed and Confused\"&mdash;still roughly album-length thanks to time constraints, and not yet the leviathan 20-minute concert centerpiece it was growing into&mdash;that their signature interplay starts to set them apart as their own entity, impossible to reproduce because they couldn't stop moving.</p><p>The in-progress nature of their 1969 material brings out some unpredictable sides. Hearing them hammer through live-set favorite \"Somethin' Else\" in rockabilly mode is borderline surreal, especially with Plant rampaging through a vocal diametrically opposed to Eddie Cochran's. And the third disc's unearthing of a three-song session once feared lost is a fine addition&mdash;as well as the first time anyone born after 1969 can hear the piano-driven, harmonica-blasting \"Sunshine Woman,\" a B.B./Albert/Freddie King-simpatico cut which is perhaps their shortest line to electric blues as contemporary style rather than a mythical predecessor. (The sound is not great here. After the masters were erased, these cuts had to be sourced from a recording off of AM radio, but they're an exception on a collection with otherwise pristine fidelity.)</p><p>The most crucial detail of their '69 sets is how nearly every BBC performance at the time included some variation of \"Communication Breakdown.\" You'd think it was their signature hit, or at least a cut that'd give them more critical affinity to the MC5 than Uriah Heep. It's always the springboard for something new, from a revelation of how many ways Page could either slice or bulldoze his way through his solo to a hint at their engagement with funk that wouldn't be heard so clearly again until The Song Remains the Same four years later.</p><p>If the 1969 sessions were Zeppelin figuring out who they were, the 1971 sessions were Led Zeppelin figuring out who they weren't. Broadcast on BBC Radio One's \"In Concert\" on April 4, 1971, and famously featuring the first-ever version of \"Stairway to Heaven\" eight months before the release of Led Zeppelin IV, the second disc features the band stepping into the vast musical expanse they had laid before themselves. III was released the previous October and was their first shot at pushing beyond their \"blooze\" rep to more vivid folk influences. There's still a medley that builds off \"Whole Lotta Love\" to skulk through foundational classics by John Lee Hooker (\"Boogie Chillun\"), Bukka White (\"Fixin' to Die Blues\"), Arthur Crudup (\"That's Alright Mama\"), and Elvis Presley (\"A Mess of Blues\"), but this chops-fest belies how hard the press mocked them for coming from a place the band would rather live in than visit as tourists__.__ And the peak-blues \"Since I've Been Loving You\" is where they finally figured out how to use their explosive power sparingly. Page's solo and Plant's wails pierce so deeply because they emerge from one of their most contemplative arrangements.</p><p>But their confidence and their chafing at being pigeonholed made for a creatively lucrative combination and the period between the releases of *III *and *IV *was the best time to capture that. So we get the heavy metal equivalent of a chromed-god Jack Kirby *Thor *drawing in \"Immigrant Song,\" the careening time signature of a power-trio version of \"Black Dog,\" and the acoustic Joni Mitchell-fueled heartbreak of \"Going to California.\" Of course there's \"Dazed and Confused\" snatched from its blues-rock cradle and transformed into the Kubrick *2001 *psychedelic stargate sequence of their live set, bowed guitar and everything. And if overexposure hasn't dulled your senses to \"Stairway to Heaven,\" you can hear it as it first sounded before it was played approximately two billion times on the radio&mdash;even if the last Page solo hadn't yet found its footing.</p><p>From a present-day perspective, where big-time arena-filling rock has settled on Muse, Foo Fighters, and 5 Seconds of Summer, diving headlong into the '69/'71 timeframe of the band that most necessitated the obnoxious yet fitting phrase \"Rock Gods\" might otherwise feel like history homework. But *BBC Sessions *captures an actual excitement, a document of a moment in an oft-told story of a band that isn't excessively beholden to it. No *Song Remains the Same *audio-visual stoner-movie overkill, no excess studio futzing, no sense that their peak was either already there or just in the rearview. It's just a meticulous document of a band whose hedonism kept them from restraining their absurd level of mastery. So here: have Zep as they both wanted to be and eventually were.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Nate Patrin, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Encompassing heavy metal, folk, pure rock & roll, and blues, Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album is a monolithic record, defining not only Led Zeppelin but the sound and style of '70s hard rock. Expanding on the breakthroughs of III, Zeppelin fuse their majestic hard rock with a mystical, rural English folk that gives the record an epic scope. Even at its most basic -- the muscular, traditionalist \"Rock and Roll\" -- the album has a grand sense of drama, which is only deepened by Robert Plant's burgeoning obsession with mythology, religion, and the occult. Plant's mysticism comes to a head on the eerie folk ballad \"The Battle of Evermore,\" a mandolin-driven song with haunting vocals from Sandy Denny, and on the epic \"Stairway to Heaven.\" Of all of Zeppelin's songs, \"Stairway to Heaven\" is the most famous, and not unjustly. Building from a simple fingerpicked acoustic guitar to a storming torrent of guitar riffs and solos, it encapsulates the entire album in one song. Which, of course, isn't discounting the rest of the album. \"Going to California\" is the group's best folk song, and the rockers are endlessly inventive, whether it's the complex, multi-layered \"Black Dog,\" the pounding hippie satire \"Misty Mountain Hop,\" or the funky riffs of \"Four Sticks.\" But the closer, \"When the Levee Breaks,\" is the one song truly equal to \"Stairway,\" helping give IV the feeling of an epic. An apocalyptic slice of urban blues, \"When the Levee Breaks\" is as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>With Led Zeppelin, there was no break-in period, no \"early phase\" where they figured out what kind of band they wanted to be. They were fully formed from the first repetition of the \"Good Times Bad Times\" riff, and they powered along through their first half-dozen albums crushing everything in their path. Zep never had their Sgt. Pepper's, their Exile, their Who's Next, because every album was more or less that good&mdash;for a while, anyway. This was a band that knew the music it wanted to make and executed it with ruthless precision. The second trio of Led Zeppelin reissues (the fourth album and Houses of the Holy came out last fall, Physical Graffiti this week) found the band inhabiting what Neil Tennant once described (and Tom Ewing fleshed out) as their \"imperial phase.\" Riding on their massive initial success, and pushed even further by the game-changing success of \"Stairway to Heaven\", everything they tried during these years somehow worked.</p><p>If you grew up on classic rock radio, you sometimes felt like you were listening to Led Zeppelin's fourth album on shuffle. It has eight songs, all of them are huge, and one, \"Stairway to Heaven\", frequently lingers near the top of lists of the Greatest Rock Songs of All Time. Given its place in culture, IV can seem like an album of moments more than songs. Individual parts have been selected, cropped, amplified, and dropped into both songs by other artists and into our collective unconscious. Every song has two or three sections that are instantly identifiable and always seem to be playing somewhere nearby. The circular guitar figure in \"Black Dog\"; the chiming mandolin in \"Going to California\"; Bonham's cymbal bashing on \"Rock and Roll\". It's hard to hear \"When the Levee Breaks\", by now, and not think of hip-hop. If Led Zeppelin's music formed the DNA of anything that could remotely be called \"hard rock,\" IV is a petri dish overflowing with stem cells. The debut was darker and moodier, II was heavier, and III was prettier, but the fourth album is a triumph of form meeting function.</p><p>\"Stairway to Heaven\" is so ubiquitous that it cycles through phases of deep reverence and self-parody, and the movement between these two poles is so rapid it all becomes a blur. This happens both for individual listeners (I'm going to guess the very young still discover this song and have their idea of what a rock song can be expanded considerably) and on the level of mass culture. It's both a marker of religion and an instant punchline, a singularity that sucks in a world of experience and observation and jeering laughter and sincere tears and compacts it all into an infinitely dense point. Like many who both love it and hate it, I pretty much never need to hear it again. But \"Stairway\" aside, IV is their least weird album. It's basically their stab at perfection, and they get there, but this band was always at its most interesting at the margins, when they had the possibility of failure.</p><p>By 1973, Zeppelin's only competition for Biggest Band in the World was the Stones, who were losing their hunger. Later that year, the Stones would put out Goat's Head Soup, beginning a period of drift they wouldn't return from until 1978's Some Girls. The field was clear, with the '60s starting to recede in the rearview, but punk was still a couple of years away, Zeppelin didn't waste the opportunity. Houses of the Holy, their fifth album in four years, takes the most powerful moments of the fourth album and amplifies them, and also adds some oddball experiments that flesh out the Led Zeppelin story.</p><p>They are most in the zone on \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", which is on a very short list of best songs Zep ever wrote, which is to say that it's among the best rock songs ever written. Everything they ever did well&mdash;pastoral beauty, crunchy riffs, stop/start changes, monster drum grooves&mdash;could be found on this single track. \"The Ocean\" features what could be Jimmy Page's single greatest riff. \"The Rain Song\" is a masterful study in the power of guitar tone, both for its full acoustic strumming and the electric guitar work that has always evoked the weather of its title. John Paul Jones' gorgeous Mellotron passage is one of the definitive uses of that strange instrument. And \"No Quarter\" is a disorienting bad-vibes epic, archetypal of the '70s, capturing the bleak interiority of a certain kind of drug experience.</p><p>Houses of the Holy is a perfectly reasonable choice for best Zeppelin LP, even if it had signs that the band couldn't last forever. \"The Song Remains the Same\" is the first sign of Robert Plant using a more pinched sound for his upper register, adapting to that gradually disappearing top octave by contorting his vocals into a strange squeal. By the last two Zeppelin records this would be his default approach when singing in this range. \"The Crunge\" is a sour version of funk, a weirdly fascinating half-song complete with a groaner of a James Brown joke. John Bonham supposedly disliked \"D'yer Mak'er\" so much he refused to write an interesting drum part, sticking instead with the first shuffle beat that came to mind. It was Zeppelin's stab at reggae, and though they never try to breathe any space or light into the mix, it's impossible to dismiss the song's easy catchiness, its affection for doo-wop melody, the motion of Page's spindly guitar.</p><p>Houses of the Holy might be Zeppelin's most impressive album on a purely sonic level, and this particular remaster reinforces that notion. The best remastering jobs always offer a subtle improvement&mdash;a touch of EQing here, a bit more volume there without overdoing it. Taken together, they hopefully offer more detail, and these versions make the grade. The bonus discs, however, continue to be disappointing. From one angle, there's actually something admirable about how little Led Zeppelin left in the vaults. It was a testament to their brutal efficiency as a rock machine. But aside from the live set released with the debut, the bonus discs so far have been the definition of \"fans only.\"</p><p>They are mostly filled with \"alternate mixes,\" which is a strange concept. Mixes freeze in time a single moment that is the end result of many individual decisions; they document fader settings. Alternate mixes showing what could have happened are literally infinite; all these mixes are said to have been created while the album was being mixed, and there is no reason to doubt that, but the truth is Page could just as easily make an \"alternate mix\" of any one of these songs this morning and no one would know the difference. The fact that a mandolin was briefly considered to be slightly louder for a given sound is basically a stray fact and nothing more. All it provides is a chance to hear familiar performances in familiar songs in a way that sounds slightly unfamiliar.</p><p>Among the first six records, aside from III, Physical Graffiti suffers least from overfamiliarity. It's Led Zeppelin's White Album, the one they made when they were at their creative peak and had a million ideas, but were also under a tremendous amount of strain and saw the end starting to come into focus. It's also, to my ears, their best album, even if it's not as unified or complete as some of what had come before. Why their best? First of all, there's more of it. The previous two albums were awesome, but each had just eight songs; Physical Graffiti has 15. It's math&mdash;when you are talking about songs from this period of the band, that makes it roughly twice as good.</p><p>But Physical Graffiti is Zeppelin's best album ultimately because it felt like a culmination. In some senses it was literally so, since its tracks had been recorded over the course of the previous few years and, in some cases, were leftovers from the previous few records. (The best of the new material was still too much for a single record, so they went back to unreleased songs and decided to flesh out a full 2xLP. The songs are all over the place, but the band makes it all work together.)</p><p>Iconic riffs abound&mdash;\"Custard Pie\", \"The Wanton Song\", and \"Houses of the Holy\" alone have more hooks than most rock bands manage in a career&mdash;but here they are just the beginning of the story. \"In My Time of Dying\" is Zeppelin's ultimate blues deconstruction, mixing the open-chord slide of acoustic Delta blues with electric heaviness and extending the whole thing past 11 minutes. Pastoral instrumentals had been in the mix for Zeppelin since the first album's \"Black Mountainside\", but Page never managed another one as beautiful as \"Bron-Yr-Aur\", a crushingly brief two minutes of guitar bliss that every rock kid who picked up an acoustic guitar in the next 10 years dreamed of playing. And their non-Western dabbling crested with \"Kashmir\". But Physical Graffiti's greatest strength is its looseness and general sense of playfulness. Here and there, Zeppelin showed comfort with pop. The bounce of \"Trampled Under Foot\" owes everything to Stevie Wonder; \"Down By the Seaside\" has an easeful lilt; and \"Night Flight\" twinkles with a bright optimism.</p><p>The song I returned to most here is also the simplest&mdash;\"Boogie With Stu\", an interpolation of Ritchie Valens' \"Ooh My Head\" (his mother gets a songwriting credit). It makes me think of what blues and early rock'n'roll meant to a certain generation of young men growing up in England during the 1950s and '60s. You hear one story after another about lives being changed by a rock'n'roll record. In a famous quote, John Lennon summed up his musical taste to Jann Wenner in a 1971 Rolling Stone interview: \"Sounds like 'Wop Bop a Loo Bop'. I like rock and roll, man, I don't like much else.\"</p><p>When the members of Led Zeppelin get together with famed session pianist/long-time pal Ian Stewart on \"Boogie With Stu\", you can hear five people who speak the same language. It's drunk on the joy of the discovery. Whatever else they have going on in their lives, they can sit down and play a chugging 12-bar song and have a fucking ball, because they remember when they first heard a song like this as kids and realized that song was a portal to another world. On Physical Graffiti, the end point of Led Zeppelin's incomparable initial run, they are living deep inside that new world, still finding new things to discover, taking it all in.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

While enthusiasts have been trading poor quality versions of this material for years, this marks the first archival video release to contain any footage of the band playing live. The main feature on the first disc includes highlights of the band's legendary set at the Royal Albert Hall on January 9, 1970. If there was ever any doubt of the power and intricate legerdemain of Jimmy Page (guitar), Robert Plant (vocal/harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass/keyboards/mandolin), and John Bonham (drums), this performance will silence all detractors. The dozen songs from this show are derived primarily from their first two LPs with a few well-chosen covers thrown in for good measure. One particularly interesting inclusion is Plant's spontaneous incorporation of a few lines from Neil Young's \"Down by the River\" and \"On the Way Home\" during an epic \"How Many More Times.\" Supplementary shorts on disc one feature a promotional video for \"Communication Breakdown\" -- with the band miming to a pre-recorded audio track -- a half-hour mini-show for Danish Television, a clip of \"Dazed and Confused\" from the British TV program Supershow, and a pair of tunes (\"Communication Breakdown\" and \"Dazed and Confused\") for the French TV show Tous en Scene.</P><P>The second DVD fast forwards to the '70s and continues with a trio of main attractions and a slew of extras. First up is a composite video for \"Immigrant Song,\" which contains some amateur footage married to a previously unissued live version of the song. This is followed by outtakes from the motion picture Song Remains the Same (1976), which finds the quartet at Madison Square Garden in 1973. The oft-bootlegged 1975 Earls Court is up next highlighted by acoustic renderings of \"Going to California\" and \"That's the Way.\" The last extended set finds Zep during their triumphant return to England in 1979. It would ultimately be a bittersweet affair as it was likewise their final performance in their homeland prior to the death of Bonham the following year. Extras on disc two include a few interview clips, promotional videos for \"Over the Hills and Far Away,\" and \"Travelling Riverside Blues\" -- both circa the Led Zeppelin (1990) four-CD box set.</P>— <B>Lindsay Planer</B>"

		"review": "<p>Led Zeppelin's reunion for an Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert in November 2007 (pushed back a couple of weeks due to a finger injury Jimmy Page sustained during rehearsals) seemed like a spur of the moment thing &mdash; but how spontaneous could it have been if it just happened to coincide with the release of an expanded The Song Remains the Same on both CD and DVD, the debut of their catalog as digital downloads, and the new two-disc compilation Mothership as a sampler of the whole shebang? Considering this full-scale, multi-prong assault &mdash; which also included a new album by Robert Plant, after all &mdash; it was probably not all that spontaneous. Such a precise attack suits this most mythic of classic rock groups, who always benefited from an enormous sense of scale. Weighing in at two discs and 24 tracks, Mothership has a sense of scale that the previous round of compilations &mdash; the two-part Early Days & Latter Days, delivered in 1999 and 2000 respectively &mdash; lacked, not just because it pushes these two phases together but because it is heavy on the heavy epics, emphasizing Zeppelin's sheer sonic ballast over either their lighter or more idiosyncratic moments. This effects the second disc more than the first, as the band started out heavy and expanded outward, and while it would have been nice if \"Fool in the Rain\" represented In Through the Out Door instead of \"In the Evening,\" this is a minor quibble as Mothership hits the obvious high points without seeming perfunctory. And that, along with Page's new remastering, is the real selling point behind Mothership: as a compilation it is both gripping listening and a good introduction to this very album-oriented band, which is what makes it a welcome addition to their catalog. [The deluxe edition of Mothership contains a DVD with highlights from their eponymous live DVD &mdash; it's a nice bonus but really, you'd be better off getting the full set.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Led Zeppelin were never much of a singles band: From 1969 on, guitarist Jimmy Page was adamant that the group's LPs not be mucked up with filler, so most of their releases contain only between eight and 10 tracks. Led Zeppelin's legacy so significantly shaped the next four decades of rock'n'roll and heavy metal that to further discount any one of those tracks seemed brash, negligent, or stupid. Twelve years of intense self-editing meant that Led Zeppelin required no best-of. Anyone truly interested in their music was advised to dig through their couch cushions until they came up with enough quarters to invest in one (or all) of the band's albums: It would be worth every penny.</p><p>Mothership&mdash;a collection of 24 of Led Zeppelin's \"greatest hits,\" remastered and selected by the band's three remaining members (Page, as well as Robert Plant and John Paul Jones)&mdash;might be conceptually flawed, but it's hard to argue against songs as indisputably great as these. Mothership is not the first time Page has participated in the distillation of his own work: In 1990, a decade after John Bonham downed his last shot of vodka, Page curated an eponymous boxset (known, in fan parlance, as Crop Circles) which saw their eight-album discography distilled to four perfect CDs. And in 2002, Atlantic released Early Days and Latter Days: Volumes 1 and 2 (each previously available as a single purchase, in 1999 and 2000, respectively), a Page-condoned collection of 23 tracks which awesomely featured all four members of Led Zeppelin on the cover, dressed in giant American space suits and perched casually in front of an illustrated moonscape. Early Days and Latter Days has a tracklist similar to Mothership (the latter adds \"D'yer Mak'er\", \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", \"Heartbreaker\", and \"Ramble On\", but loses \"Ten Years Gone\", \"What Is and What Should Never Be\", and \"The Battle of Evermore\") so, clearly, the idea of Led Zeppelin's greatest hits is contentious even for the band itself.</p><p>Fans will probably argue over Led Zeppelin's selections&mdash;omitting \"What Is and What Should Never Be\" feels unforgivable&mdash;and it seems obvious that Page, Plant, and Jones were striving hard to represent every last phase of their career: Some work from the band's crucial 1969-1975 era is sacrificed for late-career tokens like the comparably-mediocre \"In The Evening\" (itself a curious selection, given the relative popularity of In Through the Out Door's \"Fool in the Rain\", which was the band's last release to make the pop single charts). Still, content-critiquing aside, the remastering on Mothership is no small achievement, and it sounds revelatory on even the shittiest stereos. Check Bonham's pitter-pattering in the verses of \"Ramble On\", or the still-intact fuzz at the top of \"Immigrant Song\", or the tiny percussive \"fwwpts\" on \"D'yer Mak'er\", or the restored outro to \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". Twist your volume knob heavenward and embrace Plant's inescapable geekiness, yelping about Gollum and Mordor; chug booze and air-drum with John Bonham: Led Zeppelin sound as tremendous in 2007 as they did in 1972.</p><p>Mothership offers no bonus content or previously unreleased material. It serves, mainly, as an introduction for those (presumably out of classic rock radio range) still unfamiliar with the band. Longtime fans will find little of use here, although anyone who spends a couple hours with Mothership will find themselves duly reminded that Led Zeppelin are quite possibly the finest rock band of all time.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

He played piano on Lauryn Hill's \"Everything Is Everything\" and might as well be considered Kanye West's sidekick, having assisted the producer and MC on several sessions — Jay-Z's \"Encore\" and Slum Village's \"Selfish\" being two of the more prominent 2004 singles featuring his work. A former choir director, he has also released a handful of energetic live discs, some of which are credited to his less hubristic birth name, John Stephens. And though he claims \"I've got something new,\" you've also heard substantial chunks of Get Lifted in records made decades ago by Sly & the Family Stone, Curtis Mayfield, Quincy Jones, and Bill Withers. This might not be a problem for listeners who crave anything that recalls the music they first heard in their youth, but Legend's over-reliance upon his inspirations is an impediment as much as a slick way to grab attention. That's because he has more than enough talent and charm to get by on his own. His own lyrics and hooks are unique and clever enough to get the point across that he's no everyday R&B artist and, just as importantly, he has a personable and instantly fetching voice you could listen to all day long. However, the association with West — whose Sony-distributed boutique label released the record — is very helpful. Without it, Legend would likely be zoned into neo-soul (2003's Live at SOB's New York City really makes this notion apparent), thereby standing little chance of reaching the ears of anyone younger than 30. The production work supporting his songs strikes a fine balance between soul and hip-hop, allowing him to appeal to those who are coming from either angle. This is a very good record. It's a given that Legend is destined to make at least two others that top it. [Columbia released an edition with a bonus DVD.]</p><p>&mdash; <b>Andy Kellman</b></p>"

When this recording was made in 2001, Li was a mere 19 years old, but from the evidence on this disc, he was already a formidable technician. The extravagant technical difficulties of the repertoire — Chopin's Sonata No. 3, several of the etudes, and the Andante spianato et grande polonaise — are dispatched with skill and panache from the most delicate arabesques to the thunderous double octaves in contrary motion. Although there have been many other pianists who have played these works as well or better from a technical point of view, Li's performances stand up well in their company. But for all of his maturity as a technician, Li's interpretations are still those of a youth. The deeper meaning of the Sonata No. 3 — its awe-inspiring harmonic structure and its formalization of fear and courage in the opening and closing movements — are wholly beyond Li. The transcendentelegance of the Andante spianato and the radiant joy of the grande polonaise are merely graceful and cheerful in Li's interpretations. And his three Nocturnes are not so much emotional, seductive, and beautiful as they are sentimental, playful, and pretty. With his amazing technique, Li may develop into an amazing pianist. But one hopes that he grows as an interpreter as well.</p> &mdash; <b>by James Leonard - All Music</b>"

		"review": "<p>This double CD contains all four of the Toronto singer/songwriter's '60s studio albums (the live LP Sunday Concert, not included here, was also released in the '60s). On these records, his resonant vocals, lyrical ambition, and melodic strengths produced as close a rival to Bob Dylan as Canada ever fashioned during that decade, and foreshadowed work by other major Canadian singer/songwriters of the late '60s, such as Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Leonard Cohen. \"Early Mornin' Rain\" (covered by fellow Canadian folkies Ian & Sylvia), the folk-rock protest number \"Black Day in July,\" the epic \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy,\" and his cover of Ewan McColl's \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" are all present, and are among the most popular tracks Lightfoot has issued during his long career. Featuring both acoustic and folk-rock recordings, this neatly bundles Lightfoot's early work into a listenable and fairly inexpensive package.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

Accompanied by Red Shea on lead guitar and Rick Haynes on bass, he also mixed old favorites like \"I'm Not Sayin'\" and \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" with the new material on this set, which has good (though not outstanding) sound. These then-new songs aren't among his classics, but are up to the general high standard of his '60s work, with the socially conscious \"The Lost Children\" and the poetic \"Leaves of Grass\" standing out as lyrical highlights.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

Propelled by his second biggest hit, \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" Summertime Dream summed up the sound that had served Lightfoot so well in his post-\"If You Could Read My Mind\" days. This distinctive sound featured Lightfoot's strummed six- or 12-string guitar complemented by Terry Clements' electric guitar lines and Pee Wee Charles' pedal steel guitar accents. The material here is excellent, and the singer's voice is at its strongest. Mixing upbeat songs like \"Race Among the Ruins,\" \"I'd Do It Again,\" and the title track with beautiful ballads such as \"I'm Not Supposed to Care\" and \"Spanish Moss,\" Lightfoot and his band deliver a tasty smorgasbord of intelligent, grown-up music.

On both volumes of Gord's Gold, he re-recorded early songs and mixed them with current hits -- which meant that a new \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" sat next to the hits like \"Sundown,\" but on Gord's Gold, Vol. 2, newer songs (which weren't quite hits) were next to re-recorded versions of staples like \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\" This, needless to say, was a bit of an irritant, but this is well-executed enough to make up for the years of awkward compilations by covering everything from his UA recordings to his latter-day recordings for Warner in the mid-'80s. Some might say there should be a little bit more of the earlier songs, but, for most listeners, this will contain all the major items and is as close to definitive as possible to get.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Even dedicated fans tend to overlook the album, largely because it's the polar opposite of the subtly intricate, funky rhythm & roll that made their reputation during the mid-'70s. Little Feat is a raw, hard-driving, funny and affectionate celebration of American weirdness, equal parts garage rock, roadhouse blues, post-Zappa bizarreness, post-Parsons country rock and slightly bent folk storytelling. Since it's grounded in roots rock, it feels familiar enough, but the vision of chief songwriter/guitarist/vocalist Lowell George is wholly unique and slightly off-center. He sees everything with a gently surreal sense of humor that remains affectionate, whether it's on an ode to a \"Truck Stop Girl,\" the weary trucker's anthem \"Willin',\" or the goofy character sketch of the crusty old salt \"Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie.\" That affection is balanced by gutsy slices of Americana like the careening travelogue \"Strawberry Flats,\" the darkly humorous \"Hamburger Midnight\" and a jaw-dropping Howlin' Wolf medley guest-starring Ry Cooder, plus keyboardist Bill Payne's terrific opener \"Snakes on Everything.\" The songwriting itself is remarkable enough, but the band is its equal &mdash; they're as loose, vibrant and alive as the Stones at their best. In most respects, this album has more in common with George's earlier band the Factory than the rest of the Little Feat catalog, but there's a deftness in the writing and performance that distinguishes it from either band's work, which makes it all the more remarkable. It's a pity that more people haven't heard the record, but that just means that anyone who owns it feels like they're in on a secret only they and a handful of others know.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

For starters, it was captured at the time the band were at their unarguable peak and that it has an excellent sound quality featuring many of the band’s best known and best-loved numbers. Then there is the notoriety and mythology of this session -  prior to this CD (the first legitimate incarnation of its existence), this has long featured among the most revered and sought-after bootlegs in rock history. This status is no doubt enhanced by the unverified rumours that Lowell himself was involved in the mixing and production work. This possibility is not even referenced in the notes and promotions that come with this CD so there may indeed be no truth in it. But still...</p><p>Whatever the truth (if any) of Lowell’s involvement, it is a fabulous document and maybe truest representation of the band live at their peak. From the sumptuous double-whammy of the openers, Rock ’N Roll Doctor and Two Trains, right through to the closing holy trinity of Cold, Cold, Cold, Dixie Chicken and Tripe Face Boogie, the band are smoking, rocking and irresistibly funky throughout, a combination they pull off better than most any other band on the planet, before or since. In between these, there is perhaps the best ever live version of Lowell’s masterpiece, Willin’, plus a near-definitive version of Alan Toussaint’s On Your Way Down, where they offer a barely-needed reminder that while (mostly) a band raised in California, they invoked the spirit of New Orleans better than most.</p><p>With other classics given a real party-time feel, this CD is a very welcome addition to the legitimate history of a much loved and respected band. A must for fans and a great place to start for the curious.</p>"

Not coincidentally, it's the moment where George begins to recede from the spotlight, leaving the band as a true democracy. These observations are only clear in hindsight, since if Feats Don't Fail Me Now is just taken as a record, it's nothing more than a damn good rock & roll record. That's not meant as a dismissal, either, since it's hard to make a rock & roll record as seemingly effortless and infectious as this. Though it effectively builds on the Southern-fried funkiness of Dixie Chicken, it's hardly as mellow as that record - there's a lot of grit, tougher rhythms, lots of guitar and organ. It's as supple as Chicken, though, which means that it's the sound of a touring band at their peak. As it happens, the band is on the top of their writing game as well, with Bill Payne contributing the rollicking \"Oh Atlanta\" and Paul Barrere turning in one of his best songs, the jazzy funk of \"Skin it Back.\" Each has a co-writing credit with George -- Payne on the unreleased Little Feat-era nugget \"The Fan\" and Barrere (plus Fred Martin) on the infectious title track &mdash; who also has a couple of classics with \"Rock and Roll Doctor\" and the great \"Spanish Moon.\" Feats peters out toward the end, as the group delves into a 10-minute medley of two Sailin' Shoes songs, but that doesn't hurt one of the best albums Little Feat ever cut. It's so good, the group used it as the template for the rest of their career.<?p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The title of The Last Record Album isn't exactly accurate, but it cuts a lot closer than the band intended, for this really is the last album of the group's classic era. Starting here, leader Lowell George fades into the woodwork, and while the remainder of the group tries valiantly to keep the band afloat, the timing and the tension were too great. Musically, the group attempts to make Feats Don't Fail Me Now, Pt. 2, but the production from George is curiously flat, and, truth be told, the group just isn't inspired enough to make a satisfying album. For a very short album &mdash; only eight songs &mdash; too many of the cuts fall flat. Those that succeed, however, are quite good, particularly Paul Barrere and Bill Payne's gently propulsive \"All That You Dream,\" Lowell George's beautiful \"Long Distance Love,\" and the sublime \"Mercenary Territory.\" Even these songs don't have the spark or character they would have had on the more organic Feats, due to George's exceedingly mellow SoCal production, which is pleasant but doesn't provide Little Feat with enough room to breathe. There are enough signs of Little Feat's true character on The Last Record Album &mdash; the three previously mentioned songs are essential for any Feat fan &mdash; to make it fairly enjoyable, but it's clear that the band is beginning to run out of steam.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Given all that acclaim, it only made sense for the group to cut a live album. Unfortunately, they waited until 1977, when the group had entered its decline, but as the double-album Waiting for Columbus proves, Little Feat in its decline was still pretty great. Certainly, the group is far more inspired on stage than they were in the studio after 1975 - just compare \"All That You Dream,\" \"Oh Atlanta,\" \"Old Folks' Boogie,\" \"Time Loves a Hero,\" and \"Mercenary Territory\" here to the cuts on The Last Record Album and Time Loves a Hero. The versions on Waiting are full-bodied and fully-realized, putting the studio cuts to shame. Early classics like \"Fat Man in the Bathtub\" and \"Tripe Face Boogie\" aren't as revelatory, but it's still a pleasure to hear a great band run through their best songs, stretching them out and finding new quirks within them. If there are any flaws with Waiting for Columbus, it's that the Feat do a little bit too much stretching, veering toward excessive jamming on occasion - and that mildly fuzzy focus is really the only way you'd be able to tell that this is a great live band recorded slightly after their prime. Even so, there's much to savor on Waiting for Columbus, one of the great live albums of its era, thanks to rich performances that prove Little Feat were one of the great live bands of their time.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Pianist Bobo Stenson has carved his own identity out of the styles of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, drummer Billy Hart is stimulating in support and Anders Jormin provides a walking bass on many of the tracks; a rarity for ECM sessions. As one might expect, the main focus is on Charles Lloyd whose playing during the past decade has been some of the finest of his career. He mostly sticks to tenor (just playing flute on \"Little Peace\" and Chinese oboe on the very brief \"Milarepa\"), and although traces of John Coltrane's sound will always be in his tone, Lloyd comes up with quite a few original ideas. He is best on \"Thelonious Theonlyus\" (which has a slight calypso feel to it), the episodic \"Cape to Cairo Suite\" (a tribute to Nelson Mandela), a long tenor/drums duet on \"All My Relations\" (which is a mix between \"Chasin' the 'Trane\" and \"Bessie's Blues\") and the brooding spiritual \"Hymne to the Mother.\" A strong effort.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

In other words, it's not really representative, particularly in how it consciously avoids his status as a leader of the alt-country movement in the first Bush era. His Large Band, Joshua Judges Ruth, and I Love Everybody are entirely avoided (perhaps saved for Vol. 2), and even good portions of Lovett's country work are ignored, such as \"You're Not From Texas\" and the rest of The Road to Ensenada, for that matter. That's not really a complaint, but their absence feels more puzzling since two new songs are thrown in for good measure (the really good \"The Truck Song,\" plus \"San Antonio Girl\"). In any regard, this is a good summary of Lovett's first two albums, containing most of the great songs from those records &mdash; \"God Will,\" \"This Old Porch,\" \"If I Were the Man You Wanted,\" \"If I Had a Boat,\" \"Walk Through the Bottomland,\" and \"LA County\" are as good as music got in the '80s, and it's a pleasure to hear them in any context. Even so, it's hard to shake the nagging feeling that the whole story isn't told with this collection, and it's even harder not to notice that Lovett hasn't released a collection of original songs since 1996 &mdash; and, for the hardcore fans who are suckered in by the two new songs, it'll be hard not to wish that a full-fledged album is around the corner sometime soon.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The guitar virtuosity, embodied in Taj Mahal's slide work (which had the subtlety of a classical performance), Jesse Ed Davis's lead playing, and rhythm work by Ry Cooder and Bill Boatman, is of the neatly stripped-down variety that was alien to most records aiming for popular appeal, and the singer himself approached the music with a startling mix of authenticity and youthful enthusiasm. The whole record is a strange and compelling amalgam of stylistic and technical achievements -- filled with blues influences of the 1930s and 1940s, but also making use of stereo sound separation and the best recording technology. The result was numbers like Sleepy John Estes' \"Diving Duck Blues,\" with textures resembling the mix on the early Cream albums, while \"The Celebrated Walkin' Blues\" (even with Cooder's animated mandolin weaving its spell on one side of the stereo mix) has the sound of a late '40s Chess release by Muddy Waters.

		"review": "<p>In less than 24 months, Taj Mahal (guitars/vocals/banjo/harmonica) had issued the equivalent of four respective long players. The electric Giant Step (1968) was released alongside the acoustic and decidedly rural De Ole Folks at Home (1968). The nine cuts on Giant Step feature support from the instrumental trio of Jessie Ed Davis (guitar/keyboards), Gary Gilmore (bass) and Chuck Blackwell (drums). They back Taj Mahal on a wide selection of covers ranging from Carole King and Gerry Goffin's \"Take a Giant Step\" to the upbeat and soulful reading of the Huddie Ledbetter blues staple \"Keep Your Hands off Her.\" The arrangements are unique and offer the artist's distinctive approach. Nowhere is this more evident than the practically jovial mid-tempo \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\" or the freewheeling abandon that is brought to the 18-wheeler anthem \"Six Days on the Road,\" recalling the version of \"Ain't That a Lot of Love\" from Taj Mahal's preceding effort Natch'l Blues (1968). Additionally, Blind Willie Johnson's \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" stands out with a strong and soaring gospel-flavoured score. Giant Step concludes with \"Bacon Fat,\" a number attributed here via Garth Hudson and Robbie Robertson of the Band. That said, it may be better-known from the man they called Mr. Rhythm, Andre Williams, whose scattered down-home spoken interludes punctuate his February 1957 Top 10 R&B hit -- which incidentally was created under the working title \"Diddle, Diddle Womp, Womp.\" Parties searching for an apt introduction when discovering Taj Mahal's voluminous catalogue are encouraged to consider Giant Step as a highly recommended reference point.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

Although it has much of the screaming rock energy and sometimes exaggerated competitive frenzy of its predecessor, Birds of Fire is audibly more varied in texture, even more tightly organized, and thankfully more musical in content. A remarkable example of precisely choreographed, high-speed solo trading -- with John McLaughlin, Jerry Goodman, and Jan Hammer all of one mind, supported by Billy Cobham's machine-gun drumming and Rick Laird's dancing bass -- can be heard on the aptly named \"One Word,\" and the title track is a defining moment of the group's nearly atonal fury. The band also takes time out for a brief bit of spaced-out electronic burbling and static called \"Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love.\" Yet the most enticing pieces of music on the record are the gorgeous, almost pastoral opening and closing sections to \"Open Country Joy,\" a relaxed, jocular bit of communal jamming that they ought to have pursued further. This album actually became a major crossover hit, rising to number 15 on the pop album charts, and it remains the key item in the first Mahavishnu Orchestra's slim discography.</p>&mdas; <b>Richard S.

Branford Marsalis, usually known for his jazz background, asserts his mastery of the soprano saxophone on this excellent collection of romantic chamber music. Accompanied by the English Chamber Orchestra, Marsalis indulges us with some of his most fervent music yet. Each piece explores a different aspect of love and romance. Vocalese, originally for the soprano voice, portray the vocal lyricism and musicality of Marsalis' soprano saxophone. The \"Rachmaninoff Vocalese\" is an exceptional confirmation of the mastery of tone and musicianship that defines the music Marsalis is known for. Other well-known works, such as Debussy's L'Isle Joyeuse and Stravinsky's Pastorale, brilliantly contrast the air that Marsalis has played since 1981. The French and Russian compositions add a new dimension to the young Marsalis repertoire — classical romantic.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Paula Edelstein</b></p>"

Instead of following through with the hip-hop inclinations of Buckshot LeFonque, Marsalis has returned to traditional jazz, yet this is far from standard bop. Marsalis pushes at the borders of post-bop, adding elements of hip-hop and rock & roll, making for an adventurous and exciting listen. Occasionally, his experiments are unsuccessful, yet they are never less than intriguing.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Leo Stanley</strong></p>"

If there are any serious flaws in the playing, they will escape the vast majority of ears out there, for this is an uncompromising, well-played disc of acoustic jazz that leans a bit toward adventure at times. At first, Branford's foursome (Kirkland, Eric Revis on bass, and Jeff \"Tain\" Watts on drums) seems content to turn out a pretty good facsimile of the John Coltrane Quartet, with Kirkland playing brilliantly and reflectively in the McCoy Tyner manner. But with \"Lykief\" — a pun on Keith Jarrett's name — Branford takes up Jarrett's long unanswered challenge and pushes through a tumbling, nearly rhythmically free piece attractively anchored by Jarrett's gospel harmonies and melodic methods. \"Bullworth\" blasts off on a Watts hip-hop rhythm, with Branford going nuts in an angular bit of soloing, and \"16th St. Baptist Church\" apparently sends the CD home on a funky New Orleans street march, only to be followed by a touching, uncredited Marsalis/Kirkland benediction. Once again, the post-Tonight Show, post-Buckshot Marsalis makes a credibly serious jazz statement in what turned out to be the swan song for one of the neo-bop era's finest lineups.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richard S.

		"review": "<p>This album was much anticipated, for it would be Branford Marsalis's first since the death of his longtime pianist Kenny Kirkland. Happily, it is a knockout. While no one can entirely recreate the famed chemistry that existed between Kirkland and Marsalis, pianist Joey Calderazzo does a marvelous job handling the extraordinary complexity, energy, and beauty of Marsalis's music. Bassist Eric Revis and drummer Jeff \"Tain\" Watts, both of whom played on 1999's Requiem (which wound up being the last recording of Kirkland's life), carry on here in the spirit of their departed friend, fleshing out Marsalis's increasingly challenging ensemble concepts and -- most importantly -- swinging like men possessed.\"In the Crease\" and \"Tain Mutiny,\" with their unpredictable twists and turns, are indicative of the gravitas of Marsalis's work ever since he left his post at The Tonight Show. But the album's high point is a lengthy take of \"Elysium,\" a tune that appeared on Requiem as a trio piece, an aesthetic choice necessitated by the sudden death of Kirkland who never had a chance to play on the track. Here the full quartet weighs in, deftly executing a dizzying series of tempo shifts and subtle cues, all seamlessly worked into a fabric of extended, burning improvisation. Finally, \"Sleepy Hollow,\" a slow blues tucked away at the end of the program as a hidden track, sounds as though the band just let the tape roll as they warmed down from the session. It's a delightfully unrehearsed moment, perhaps a closing homage to Kirkland, drawn from deep down in the tradition.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>David R. Adler</strong></p>"

Beginning with his first session as a leader on 1983's Scenes in the City through to 1999's Requiem — his second to last album for the label — the eldest of the Marsalis brothers carved a singular path through the jazz world. Inspired by such innovative luminaries as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Wayne Shorter, Marsalis always displayed a deep understanding of his jazz roots while also looking to put his own unique stamp on the music. Never as buttoned-up as his trumpet-playing brother, the saxophonist made recordings that often seemed brilliantly haphazard, allowing for humorous and idiosyncratic forays into gutbucket blues and torrents of avant-garde skronk. His almost psychic connection with his bandmates, including the late pianist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Jeff \"Tain\" Watts, and bassist Robert Hurst, made for exciting and sometimes irreverent music that often gave the impression of eavesdropping on a conversation ripe with inside jokes. Most of the tracks here are original compositions by Marsalis, and many showcase his early \"burnout\" aesthetic of pushing his solos to the furthest limit he could. Others, such as \"Royal Garden Blues\" and \"Sidney in da Haus,\" find the versatile New Orleans native rejoicing in his hometown second-line traditions with a bluesy, modernist edge. Marsalis left Columbia in 2002 to start his own independent music label; The Steep Anthology is a fitting tribute to the development of one of the most influential and individualistic jazz musicians of his generation.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Matt Collar</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>John Martyn was Island Records' first white solo performer. Having debuted as a fresh-faced teenage folky with 1967's London Conversation, he soon embarked on a restless musical odyssey. Built on a foundation of folk, blues, and jazz, Martyn's music has ranged from effects-laden experimentation, through rock, to fusion-influenced pop. This overview of Martyn's Island recordings ignores his first two albums and two releases with then-wife Beverley, picking up with Bless the Weather (1971). Although ornate love songs from that record like \"Head and Heart\" remain close to Martyn's traditionalist roots, the instrumental \"Glistening Glyndebourne\" shows he was keen to distance himself from the Donovan-Cat Stevens orbit of twee folk-pop. Solid Air, 1973's sublime follow-up, is well represented here. On it, Martyn moved effortlessly among light acoustic tunes (\"Over the Hill\"), darker, jazzier numbers (\"Solid Air,\" his ode to friend Nick Drake), and gizmo-enhanced excursions (his rendering of Skip James' \"I'd Rather Be the Devil\"). Martyn pursued his experimental inclinations further with the jazz-folkadelic Inside Out (1973); that album's adventurous spirit is captured by the gently droning \"Eibhli Ghail Chiuin Ni Chearbhaill,\" which reworks a 19th century Celtic folk tune with such late 20th century rock tools as a fuzzbox and phase-shifter. Sunday's Child (1974) returned to a more focused song format, as demonstrated by the mournful \"Spencer the Rover.\" Martyn's next studio venture, One World (1977), combined chilled-out moodscapes (\"Small Hours\") with slick, adult-oriented pop and rock (\"Dancing\"), the latter tendency even more prominent on Grace & Danger (1980) and exemplified by the delicate \"Sweet Little Mystery.\" While Martyn's later Island releases were less memorable, those mid-'80s numbers collected here hold up well. This album provides a great introduction to John Martyn; its only weakness is the omission of his earliest efforts, a sampling of which would give a fuller sense of his work's evolution.</p>&mdash; <b>Wilson Neate</b>"

It will be easy to blame modern practitioners like Wilco, Will Oldham, or Calexico for getting me infatuated with that country-rock sound, slightly fried in the sun, yet mellow enough for the most Cuervo and Columbian-shriveled mind, but the biggest culprit will be Ian Matthews.  He alone has made that peaceful, easy feeling of loathsome So-Cal sound palatable to my ears by masticating songs that Frey & Co. would one day cop and make more famous on their own.A player on the first two Fairport Convention albums, Matthews saw the similarity between the folk revival in England and the emerging singer/songwriter scene in L.A., and after a few group efforts as Plainsong and Matthews Southern Comfort, he left the UK's clammy chill for good to reside in the eternally sunny clime of California, hooking up with producer Michael Nesmith to record his fifth solo album, Valley Hi. Nesmith, of course, is better known as the lanky, wool-capped Monkee, but his career also took turns into weird film/television projects like Popclips (which would one day morph into the behemoth known as MTV) and Elephant Parts, as well as a modest stake in that gilded-country sound of his solo career (his greatest success still being the pen behind Linda Ronstadt's \"Different Drum\").Fans of Being There or The Royal Tennenbaums soundtrack can imagine a mashing of the two for Ian Matthews' exquisite, swooping country-take of \"These Days\", his reedy voice replacing Nico's     morphine drip.</p><p>As a collector of songs, his ear was excellent, with many of his covers being turned into gold for other MOR artists. Without the help of the songwriter credits, it'd be hard to glean what songs are the traditional folk standards and which are 50s country two-step.  Then there's the rare Richard Thompson song and the rare Randy Newman one.  Not to mention that Matthews' is an adept writer, too, slipping his originals into the running order.  He commingles the disparate strands effortlessly, infusing them with his laidback pacing and quivering, gentle voice until they're all of a piece.  His take on Nesmith's concise friendship-into-love song \"Propinquity\" gets delivered with a tender lilt,     while his cover of Steve Young's \"7 Bridges Road\" was lifted wholesale by the Eagles in the early 80s. They also made a hit out of Tom Waits' \"Ol' 55\", a song which opens Ian Matthews' sixth album, Some Days You Eat the Bear and Some Days the Bear Eats You, released a year later.  Without Nesmith's Texas twang touch behind the board, the album hangs a little more precariously, less cohesive than its     predecessor.  Matthews' \"Keep on Sailing\" (which opened Valley Hi) gets slowed to a sluggish, sax-stuffed pace.  The covers still stun, though.  Crazy Horse's heartbreaking \"I Don't Wanna Talk About It\" (Rod Stewart hit with it) and Gene Clark's \"Tried So Hard\" (covered back in his days with Fairport Convention) are delivered with a mastery that stands along with the originals while also sounding refreshed in Matthews' throat.</p><p>The second side of the album, however, falls off with the Steely Dan and Jesse Winchester covers lost under that ever-increasing smog of adult contemporary radio.  Still, for a good part of this two-fer collection of his Elektra solo albums, Matthews' recasts the future hits with effortless grace, reaching into his English past and his American country present to amalgamate something distinct, never once sounding like he's just out riding fences.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Andy Beta, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

The future Fleetwood Mac founder leaves a strong stamp on his only album with the Bluesbreakers, singing a few tracks and writing a couple, including the devastating instrumental \"Supernatural.\" Green's use of thick sustain on this track clearly pointed the way to his use of this feature on Fleetwood Mac's hits \"Albatross\" and \"Black Magic Woman,\" as well as providing a blueprint for Carlos Santana's style. Mayall acquits himself fairly well on this mostly original set (with occasional guest horns), though some of the material is fairly mundane. Highlights include the uncharacteristically rambunctious \"Leaping Christine\" and the cover of Freddie King's \"Someday After a While (You'll Be Sorry).\"</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

		"review": "<p>A few nights prior to writing this review, I reviewed John Mayer's Toronto concert. The very idea that he performed at the city's Air Canada Centre was a big leap from my standpoint. With two albums to his credit, the thought of him filling half of the venue would've been a plus. But when the place nearly sold out, it was a big surprise. It's that same buzz surrounding the Connecticut-born and now Atlanta-based performer that is making his new album a big deal. But is it all that big of a deal? Well, in some cases yes and in others, particularly the last few songs, no. Oh god no!</p><p>The opening track, \"Clarity\", starts off with a simple acoustic guitar and a steady handclap that works nicely in the background. Here Mayer starts off slowly before moving into a style that yearns for adult-contemporary radio. Light but not lightweight, punchy but not over-the-top, the chorus just ambles along. Mayer hates being compared to Dave Matthews, but if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck (not that either party does), the comparisons will be there. If Matthews had done more of this on his solo debut, the results might have been better. The ensuing tune, the leadoff single \"Bigger than My Body\", makes the album soar for a brief period of time. Having all the right parts in nearly all the right places, the tune is easily the single. Unfortunately, Mayer doesn't revisit this up-tempo format often for the album's remainder.</p><p>\"Something's Missing\", which is also found on Mayer's live album Any Given Thursday, has a soulful flavor that works to his strengths. The guitar riff resembles Bruce Cockburn or Sting, but it still has its effect later on. The checklist itemized near the conclusion is another asset Mayer has going for him: strong songwriting without being too highbrow or quirky. \"New Deep\" sounds like an extension of the previous song, with nearly a similar arrangement with less edge. Some might consider this a breather, but given how it drops off later, it's not really that bad. What is perhaps the album's highlight is \"Come Back to Bed\", a horn-tinged Motown-esque slow dance that Mayer pulls off with flying colors. Drawing the listener in early and often, Mayer's blues guitar prowess is shown in spots. \"And I won't sleep through this / I survive on the breath you are finished with\", he sings.</p><p>\"Home Life\" is more urban sounding with its brand of back-beat and structure. Although building to a relatively decent chorus, it seems to miss the mark and falls flat from the first chorus onwards. Fans who find no fault with their heroes will lap this type of song up, but the groove comes too late to right this musical ship. Thankfully, \"Split Screen Sadness\" atones for the last tune. Bringing to mind early alternative rock, the bass line and Mayer's vocal shine while the keyboards add an anthem-like quality. It's also possibly as close as Mayer will ever get to a U2 effort. Slow building but definitely a toe-tapper, the song can basically do no wrong, even in its mellower melancholic lines. \"I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day / Don't let me get away\", he sings as if he's been influenced in some way by the Cure's Robert Smith.</p><p>The last three tracks have one promising song. The acoustic folk-like \"Daughters\" brings Sting to mind, but it's definitely a breather song when played live. The simple strumming and wordplay mesh well together. But the final two tracks sound more like filler than anything here. It's a noticeable drop as \"Only Heart\" tries for a pop rock idea, but it sounds far too forced and, to a lesser, extent, rushed. \"Do not waste this evening\", Mayer opens the song. Perhaps he's muttering to himself as the song is just too glossy and color-by-numbers. What is more depressing is how it shines compared to \"Wheel\", a tune left best to people like Ron Sexsmith. The chorus tends to keep it together a tad, but it seems too mediocre. Overall, Heavier Things is a sophomore effort that doesn't have as many drawbacks as one might assume. Seems he's in it for the long haul.</p>&mdash; <b>Jason MacNeil</b>"

		"review": "<p>What got into John Mayer? Sometime after the release of his 2003 sophomore album, Heavier Things, a perfectly pleasant affair that expanded on the dreamy, mellow adult pop of his breakthrough hit, \"Your Body Is a Wonderland,\" he decided that he just didn't want to follow that direction anymore. He started penning a monthly column for Esquire magazine, within which he hinted that his musical tastes were far broader than his recordings suggested, and then he started cameoing all over the place, appearing on albums by Buddy Guy, Herbie Hancock, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and John Scofield -- heavy hitters one and all, yet none of them seemed to have much to do with Mayer's music, at least on the surface. These veterans recognized something within Mayer's playing, but more importantly, he realized that he needed to push himself further and decided to expand his horizons by seizing the opportunity to play with these masters and then incorporating what he learned into his own music.</p> </p>He toured as a power trio with studio pros Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino and recorded the live album Try! while on the road. There are no two ways about it: anybody who dismissed Mayer as a lite Dave Matthews wannabe based on his first two records will be forced to reassess him on the basis of this excellent record. While he still has some vocal tics that bring to mind Matthews and certainly shares an affection for lengthy live jams, Mayer has developed serious chops that transcend boilerplate jam band rock, where the groove and feel is more important than what's played. Here, Mayer is pushed by Jordan and Palladino -- and he pays back the favor by giving them equal billing on the album's front cover, which is unusual for any pop/rock star of his popularity (the cover also marks the second Blue Note allusion in Mayer's oeuvre, which is surely not a coincidence) -- and he rises to the challenge with muscular playing that's his best playing on record. Not just that, but there's a palpable grit to Try! -- and a sultry smoothness to the mellow numbers -- unheard on his previous studio albums. That alone would make Try! not just noteworthy, but a step forward for Mayer. But what makes it more remarkable is that Mayer takes an even greater risk by relying on new material for this album. There are two older songs -- \"Something's Missing\" and the hit \"Daughters,\" both from Heavier Things -- but the rest consists of covers of Jimi Hendrix and Ray Charles (\"Wait Until Tomorrow\" and \"I Got a Woman,\" respectively) and new songs that showcase Mayer's earthier, blues-rock direction. Although he sometimes dips into blues-rock clichés -- particularly on the slow-crawling \"Out of My Mind\" -- it's only on occasion (and when he does tread that familiar ground, he does so with conviction), and the songs overall are his strongest, most ambitious set of tunes yet. And that's what's most impressive about Try! -- Mayer has expanded what he can do as a musician and a writer and in the process has definitively separated himself from the pack of sensitive, jammy modern singer/songwriters. Based on this, he has more heart, soul, ambition, and chops than the rest of them combined.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<P>Anybody who was initially confused by singer/songwriter John Mayer's foray into blues with 2005's Try! John Mayer Trio Live in Concert could only have been further confounded upon listening to the album and coming to the realization that it was actually good. And not just kinda good, especially for guy who had been largely labeled as a Dave Matthews clone, but really, truthfully, organically as good as a blues album in its own right. However, for longtime fans who had been keeping tabs on Mayer, the turn might not have been so unexpected. Soon after the release of his 2003 sophomore album, the laid-back, assuredly melodic Heavier Things, Mayer began appearing on albums by such iconic blues and jazz artists as Buddy Guy, B.B. King, and Herbie Hancock. And not just singing, but playing guitar next to musicians legendary on the instrument. In short, he was seeking out these artists in an attempt to delve into the roots of the blues, a music he obviously has a deep affection for.</P><P>Rather than his blues trio being a one-off side project completely disconnected to his past work, it is clear now that it was the next step in his musical development. And truthfully, while Try! certainly showcases Mayer's deft improvisational blues chops, it's more of a blues/soul album in the tradition of such electric blues legends as Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and features songs by Mayer that perfectly marry his melodic songcraft and his blues-slinger inclinations. In fact, what seemed at the time a nod to his largely female fan base (the inclusion of \"Daughters\" and \"Something's Missing\" off Heavier Things), was actually a hint that he was bridging his sound for his listeners, showing them where he was going.</P><P>That said, nothing he did up until the excellent, expansive Try! could have prepared you for the monumental creative leap forward that is Mayer's 2006 studio effort Continuum. Working with his blues trio/rhythm section of bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Steve Jordan, along with guest spots by trumpeter Roy Hargrove and guitarist Ben Harper, Mayer brings all of his recent musical explorations and increasing talents as a singer/songwriter to bear on Continuum. Produced solely by Mayer and Jordan, the album is a devastatingly accomplished, fully realized effort that in every way exceeds expectations and positions Mayer as one of the most relevant artists of his generation.</P><P>Adding weight to the notion that Mayer's blues trio is more than just a creative indulgence, he has carried over two tracks from the live album in \"Vultures\" and the deeply metaphorical soul ballad \"Gravity.\" These are gut-wrenchingly poignant songs that give voice to a generation of kids raised on TRL teen stars and CNN sound bytes who've found themselves all grown up and fighting a war of \"beliefs.\" Grappling with a handful of topics -- social and political, romantic and sexual, pointedly personal and yet always universal in scope -- Mayer's Continuum here earns a legitimate comparison to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?. Nobody -- not a single one of Mayer's contemporaries -- has come up with anything resembling a worthwhile anti-war anthem that is as good and speaks for their generation as much as his \"Waiting on the World to Change\" -- and he goes and hangs the whole album on it as the first single.</P><P>It's a bold statement of purpose that is carried throughout the album, not just in sentiment, but also tone. Continuum is a gorgeously produced, brilliantly stripped-to-basics album that incorporates blues, soft funk, R&amp;B, folk and pop in a sound that is totally owned by Mayer. It's no stretch when trying to describe the sound of Continuum to color it in the light of work by such legends as Sting, Eric Clapton, Sade, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Steve Winwood. In fact, the sustained adult contemporary tone of the album, which could easily have become turgid, boring, or dated never does, and brings to mind such classic late-'80s albums as Sting's Nothing Like the Sun, Clapton's Journeyman, and Vaughan's In Step.</P><P>At every turn, Continuum finds Mayer to be a mature, thoughtful, and gifted musician who fully grasps his place not just in the record industry, but in life.</P><P>— <B>Matt Collar</B></P>"

Retaining more than a modicum of the slick soul-blues undertones of Continuum, Mayer fashions a modern groove album, a record that maintains a smooth seductive vibe so thoroughly it spills into a weird one-man band cover of \"Crossroads,\" turning Clapton's contained Cream masterwork into something about vibe, not virtuosity. Mayer remains a disciple of Slowhand, but he shows an unusual interest in the big AOR stylings of Journeyman, along with Stevie Ray Vaughan's In Step, creating a coolly clean blend of synths and Strats, one that's as much about texture as it is song -- something perfectly appropriate for a make-out album like this. Sometimes, Mayer dips too heavily toward the texture -- not just in the sound sculptures in the bedding of \"Heartbreak Warfare,\" but even the strum-n-croon of \"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\" -- and his love-as-war metaphors land with the thud of a dud bomb, but he can't resist a good, tight melody and builds the bulk of Battle Studies upon them: the elegant \"Half of My Heart,\" the stoned self-deprecating wit of \"Who Says,\" the softly soulful \"Perfectly Lonely.\" Here, Mayer is effortlessly seductive and somewhat irresistible, and it's easy to see why the ladies love cool John.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Stephen Thomas Erlewine<strong></p>"

Yet the alert John McLaughlin follower will note that beyond the reliance upon South Indian instruments and scales, there are unbroken links to records like My Goal's Beyond and the high-speed electric music that McLaughlin was casting aside at the moment. McLaughlin called his new quintet Shakti, which means \"creative intelligence and beauty and power\" and the music here has all of that and something else, a ferocious streak inherited from the Mahavishnu days. McLaughlin ignites \"Joy\" by playing at a blazing speed, his cohorts Lakshminarayana Shankar (violin), Ramnad V. Raghavan and T.H. Vinayakram (mridangam), and Zakir Hussain (tabla) keeping up with the furious unison tempos with great dexterity and discipline, while a reworking of \"Lotus Feet\" forms a meditative interlude. Side two is taken up by a single, lengthy raga-like track in which McLaughlin combines his rapid-fire Western manner with note-bending techniques clearly emulating a sitar, and the Indians get plenty of dueling room. In its way, this fire-eating acoustic music is just as energizing as the most electrified Mahavishnu flights.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S. Ginell</strong></p>"

This quintet, along with bass and drums, contained two keyboard players, Francois Couturier and the noted classical pianist Katia Labeque (who was McLaughlin's companion). Labeque, seated at a Synclavier and a grand piano, has acres of technique and almost no feeling for jazz, though she is adept at providing moody backdrops, and her rapid-fire synth runs and Jarrett-like etudes on the Steinway aren't too far away stylistically from McLaughlin's helter-skelter flurries. In a continued homage to McLaughlin's once and future employer Miles Davis, \"Blues for L.W.\" brazenly quotes \"Blues for Pablo,\" and sometimes the music texturally resembles the heavily synthesized things that Miles would soon be putting out.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S.

Engaging in interplay at all kinds of tempos with bassist Kai Eckhardt and supported by the fleet, subtle drums and percussion of Trilok Gurtu, McLaughlin concentrates his energies on the acoustic guitar. Now and then, he flips a switch and plays through a guitar synthesizer whose broad attacks and occasional organ-like timbres often compensate nicely for the lack of a keyboardist. This trio encourages McLaughlin to display a funkier touch on his instrument without giving up any blinding speed; \"Pasha's Love\" contains unison flurries as furious as any from the first Mahavishnu group, only at a lower volume level. The final \"Blues for L.W.\" (Lech Walesa) climaxes with some vocal Indian syllabic jamming that joyously rounds out the concert.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richard S. Ginell</strong></p>"

Featuring a wide range of musicians including appearances by the Free Spirits, the Guitar Trio, and an electric version of Shakti, the Promise is easily the most wide-ranging and diverse offering of McLaughlin's long career. Its contents encompass everything from straight post-bop and swinging soul-jazz to fusion to modern takes on East Indian music as it meets the West. As if this weren't enough, there are even moments with spoken word laced throughout, such as a verse of Dante read by Stefania Bombi toward the end of his scorching, funky, soul-jazz number \"Thelonius Melodius\" with B-3 organist Joey DeFrancesco and drummer Dennis Chambers. The set kicks off with one of its finest moments, a guitar-to-guitar reading of John Lewis' \"Django\" with Jeff Beck (bassist Pino Palladino, drummer Mark Mondesir, and drummer Tony Hymas round it out). Beck's solo is first; it is expansive as it moves from a gorgeous restating of the melody through slinky harmonic extrapolations. McLaughlin's answer is ambitious and intuitive. They then move toward one another and the melody, complementing each other perfectly. \"El Ciego\" is a complex, flamenco-tinged jazz number with McLaughlin trading knotty lines and soulful solos with Al di Meola and Paco de Lucia. \"Jazz Jungle\" is late 20th century fusion at its blazing best with Michael Brecker, Chambers, Don Alias, James Genus, and Jim Beard beginning almost nebulously before ratcheting the tempo and idea palettes to dizzying heights (Brecker is particularly brilliant). \"The Wish,\" with Zakir Hussein, Nishat Khan, and Trilok Gurtu, looks deeply into Indian classical music balanced by a European gaze. McLaughlin's engagement with Khan's sitar creates nearly rapturous expression, all the while contained inside a texture that is as atmospheric as it is exotic. \"Shin Jin Rui\" employs the same band as \"Jazz Jungle,\" with the exception of the saxophone, played by David Sanborn. His playing is riskier than on his own records, his alto juxtaposed with McLaughlin's guitar, a study in funky, electric jazz modernism. The set closes with a lovely all-acoustic reading of Jimmy Rowles' \"The Peacocks\" with guitarist Phillipe Loi and bassist Yan Maresz, and a verse by Lorca read by Susana Beatrix as an end cap. Ultimately, The Promise stands as one of McLaughlin's towering achievements as a guitarist and leader.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

As before, when the name was last floated in the 1980s, it is a very different sound, but closer to the original Mahavishnu blend than the '80s version ever got. There are rapid-fire unison statements as in the old days, but now softer and more complex in texture and definitely lower in volume. Dennis Chambers, a leftover from the McLaughlin organ trio of the early '90s, is probably the most incendiary drummer McLaughlin has featured since Billy Cobham, and he really mixes things up throughout the CD, including a sizzling one-on-one duel with the guitarist on the questionably titled \"Acid Jazz.\" McLaughlin brandishes his technique with the old flash, yet as has been the pattern in his middle age, his tone is mellow and rounded, often heard through the transforming gauze of MIDI electronics. The experienced Jim Beard is responsible for the keyboard textures; Gary Thomas offers capable tenor, soprano and flute leads; Matthew Garrison (son of Jimmy) is the excellent electric bass player, and they are often augmented by the Latin percussion of Victor Williams. Again, one can say that McLaughlin's playing is more musical and charged with greater authority now than a quarter of a century ago, though not as hot in temperature. Even so, this is the warmest his music has been since the Mahavishnu days.</p>&mdash; <b>Richard S. Ginell</b>"

What's not to love? Frankly, what's not to love is often the music itself, which all too frequently is long on multicultural good intentions and short on things like coherence, interest, and hooks. The intermittently mystical jazz guitarist John McLaughlin, who has been nursing an India jones for decades now, is hardly innocent of such offenses. But on The Believer, a live set featuring McLaughlin, electric mandolinist U. Shrinivas, kanjira and ghatam player V. Slevaganesh, and legendary tabla player Zakir Hussain, he delivers a gloriously tight, rhythmically thrilling program of original compositions (as well as one contribution each from Shrinivas and Hussain). The group is called Remember Shakti in reference to Shakti, the similarly configured band that McLaughlin co-led in the mid-'70s. If anything, his playing has grown more exciting than it was then; listening to him negotiate the thorny rhythmic changes of this music in unison with Shrinivas and to both of them bouncing off the complexly woven rhythmic patterns laid out by Hussain and Slevaganesh is not only impressive, but uplifting as well. Highlights include the downright funky \"Anna\" and Shrinivas' composition \"Maya.\" Very highly recommended.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Rick Anderson</strong></p>"

Shrinivas (on mandolin) and V. Selvaganesh (on kanjira, ghatam, and mridangam, all Indian percussion instruments) remain from the previous album, but there are also a number of Indian guest musicians, giving the music many added dimensions. The most remarkable guests are Debashish Bhattacharya on Hindustani slide guitar, Shankar Mahadevan on vocals, and Shiv Kumar Sharma on santur, an Indian hammered dulcimer. Sharma composed the second track, \"Shringar\"; nearly half an hour long, it consists almost entirely of a hypnotic dialogue between santur and guitar. Mahadevan's vocal performance on the opening \"Luki\" resounds with spiritual power, while Shrinivas's \"Giriraj Sudha\" gives a sunny, optimistic lift to the somewhat mournful set.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>David R.

But McLaughlin is equally accomplished on the acoustic guitar; he has a long history of excelling on that instrument, which he plays exclusively on Thieves and Poets. This 2003 release, in fact, isn't fusion in the amplified jazz-rock sense but rather acoustic-oriented post-bop with Euro-classical leanings. Thieves and Poets finds McLaughlin joining forces with two of Europe's classical outfits: the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie (with Renato Rivolta serving as conductor) and the much smaller, guitar-oriented Aighetta Quartet. The former appears on the title track, a lavish, three-movement, 26-minute orchestral work that has hints of Spanish flamenco at times. Meanwhile, Aighetta joins McLaughlin on four standards, all of which are dedicated to pianists he admires; the British guitarist acknowledges Bill Evans on \"My Romance,\" Herbie Hancock on \"Stella by Starlight,\" Chick Corea on \"My Foolish Heart,\" and Gonzalo Rubalcaba on Luiz Eca's \"The Dolphin.\" But he certainly does so in a personal, introspective way. Yes, \"My Romance,\" \"Stella by Starlight,\" and \"My Foolish Heart\" are warhorses that have been beaten to death over the years — great songs that have been recorded so many times that some jazz enthusiasts feel there should be a moratorium on them in the 21st century. But McLaughlin is such an accomplished, distinctive musician that he's allowed a warhorse or two (or three). Besides, he plays beautifully on these standards, and his lyricism is extremely individualistic. Hearing McLaughlin (who turned 60 in 2002) embracing Tin Pan Alley songs with a classical guitar group is hardly the same as hearing some 19-year-old, knee-jerk Sarah Vaughan wannabe attempting to squeeze the last drops out of blood from them. It's the difference between mindlessly going through the motions and saying something personal — and on this memorable CD, McLaughlin's playing is undeniably personal.</p>&mdash; <b>Alex Henderson</b>"

Yet Ballard is a different kind of drummer, more diverse and certainly more kinetic in his approach, as evidenced by this disc. This is Mehldau's most energetic and rigorous recording to date. These ten cuts are comprised mainly of covers, though aside from \"Alfie,\" there isn't anything here approaching a standard. There are tunes here by the Beatles (\"She's Leaving Home\" and a glorious solo version of \"Martha My Dear\" with a Scarlatti-esque study in counterpoint to usher it in), Paul Simon (a jaunty read of \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\"), Nick Drake (the title cut), and even Radiohead (in the crackling energy of \"Knives Out\"). There are two fine originals as well: the shimmering \"Artis,\" with its striated right-hand work, and the Latin-tinged \"Turtle Town,\" a somewhat breezy ballad that is nonetheless knotty and off-kilter enough in its melody and in Mehldau's solo to become complex and challenging. Day Is Done is another exceptional chapter in the Mehldau catalog, one that showcases a willingness to stretch itself to the breaking point and open up the band to a wider array of approaches.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>The Way Up is the Pat Metheny Group's debut offering for Nonesuch Records. Comprised of a single, sprawling, 68-minute composition by Metheny and Lyle Mays -- divided into four sections on CD -- it is an unprecedented new direction for the band. The lineup is the same as on the live Speak of Now from 2003 -- Metheny and Mays on keyboards, bassist Steve Rodby, drummer Antonio Sanchéz, and trumpeter/vocalist Cuong Vu. New to the roster is Swiss/American harmonicat Gregoire Maret. While the sound here is instantly recognizable as PMG, it is dazzling and labyrinthine in shape, sound, and texture. Painstakingly composed, The Way Up also offers large open sections for solo improvisation and group interplay. The work's theme is stated in part one, unfolding gradually as skeletal layered guitars, samples, and other gentle electronics ease the frame into view, Sanchéz's drumming creating an insistent pulse. Mays' piano and Metheny's guitar engage in contrapuntal arpeggios and Vu enters haltingly with the actual line before the ensemble engages it as a whole. Brief melodic interludes usher in the longish second section seamlessly, where lyric fragments become full-blown statements, as the band's trademark restrained dynamic slips in unobtrusively before erupting into sheer euphoria with layered, crunchy, and fat six-strings, lilting harmonicas, and trumpets in tandem, all buoyed by Mays and Rodby, who underscore Sanchéz's skittering cymbal dance.</p><p>As it progresses, the band takes more chances, walking out onto a ledge and simply jumping off -- while never losing the deep, lush lyricism inherent in the composition's body. The thematic body and the hook at its core are infectious. These, too, open inwardly to an entirely new set of musical ideas in the middle of the section that changes no less than three times in its 26-minute duration. Mays' piano, an acoustic guitar, and Rodby's fretless bass tiptoe ghostlike into part three before Vu once more shimmers and spatters colorful notes across the top in a hush before allowing Maret to bring the entire line into being. Spare, careful, and emotionally moving, it builds until the entire band gels and cracks it into a breezy elegant walk through airy harmonics and slippery rhythms before notions of counterpoint, dense syncopated rhythmic figures (à la Steve Reich), and tight, tense dynamics segue into the final section. Here is where all previous elements come together into a swinging whole. Fueled by Mays' ostinato in the intro, Metheny's soloing winds around the outside, punctuating and stretching it as electronics paint the backdrop. The band locks into the groove before Maret and Vu add banners of expressionistic color. The Way Up feels more like a jazz concerto than anything else. If anything, it may actually be the record Metheny and Mays have been trying to make for over two decades. It is the place between the cracks, where defined genres disappear into a poetic whole and what emerges is something utterly new, guided and inspired by the limitless creativity of the jazz tradition.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett has long been active in elective politics in Australia, and like any good politician, he knows that sometimes the most important thing is to get your message out to the masses, even it means speaking with a bit less force than might be your custom. While the hard edges and challenging angles of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Red Sails in the Sunset made Midnight Oil bona fide superstars in Australia, they were little more than a rumor in most of the rest of the world, and for their sixth album, Diesel and Dust, Midnight Oil made some changes in their approach. On Diesel and Dust, there's less in the way of bruising hard rock like \"Best of Both Worlds,\" nothing as eccentric as \"Outside World,\" and very little as esoterically regional as \"Jimmy Sharman's Boxers,\" while the production favors the tuneful side of the band's songwriting (which, truth to tell, was always there) and buffs away some of the group's harsher edges. As a result, Diesel and Dust isn't an album for hardcore Oils fans, but as a bid for a larger audience, it was both shrewd and well executed -- it was the group's first real worldwide success, going platinum in America and spawning a massive hit single, \"Beds Are Burning.\"</p><p>While the album lacks the kick-in-the-head impact of their earlier work, Diesel and Dust also makes clear that the bandmembers could apply their intelligence and passion to less aggressive material and still come up with forceful, compelling music, as on the haunting \"The Dead Heart\" and the poppy but emphatic \"Dreamworld.\" And as always, there was no compromise in the band's forceful political stance -- most of the album's songs deal openly with the issues of Aboriginal rights (hardly an issue pertinent only to Australians), and one of Midnight Oil's greatest victories may well be writing a song explicitly demanding reparations for indigenous peoples, and seeing it top the charts around the world. And the closer, \"Sometimes,\" may be the finest and most moving anthem the band ever wrote (\"Sometimes you're beaten to the core/Sometimes you're taken to the wall/But you don't give in\"). Diesel and Dust is that rarity, a bid for the larger audience that's also an artistic success and a triumph for leftist politics -- even the Clash never managed that hat trick this well.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

The songs aren't quite on par with those from Diesel and Dust, but there's still enough here to make it a worthy follow-up. The lead track \"Blue Sky Mine\" deals with the oppression of the lower working class within the context of a mining company. The immediately catchy cut managed to find mid-chart success. Other notable tracks are the driving \"Forgotten Years,\" which also managed a bit of airplay, and the menacing \"Mountains of Burma.\" The band stumble only once, on the clumsy love song \"Shakers and Movers.\"</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Tom Demalon</strong></p>"

However, there are a few important distinctions. First, The Real Thing has four new songs straight from the studio. Second, all these live songs are from the band's more subtle acoustic performances. And third, it is one of the most definitive collections the band has ever recorded. \"The Dead Heart\" sounds utterly magnificent, injecting restrained aboriginal majesty into one of the band's most over-played songs. However, \"In the Valley\" (taken from the band's MTV Unplugged show) is the most telling: Completely subverted into a piano-led solo instead of the original's searing peaks, Peter Garrett vocalizes the loss of the recent death of a loved one with such vulnerability it is nothing less than astonishing. So with this in mind, are the new studio tracks even worthwhile or just distractions? Well, both \"Say Your Prayers\" and \"The Last of the Diggers\" retain the renewed vitriol of albums like Redneck Wonderland, yet more with the natural tones of Earth and Sun and Moon this time around. One may feel that The Real Thing as a whole might lack the sheer onslaught of a more varied, \"plugged\" Midnight Oil, but even an embittered listener would have to admit that the band is first and foremost a live group. Because to showcase such strengths in this enormously rewarding collection of acoustic live selections is a welcome open door for a casual listener as well as a blowing kiss to longtime, loyal fans.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Dean Carlson</strong></p>"

They're still as righteously indignant as ever over the plight of the common man, although perhaps not quite as direct or focused. There's plenty of fire in the belly, though, on driving cuts like \"Golden Age\" and the tempered optimism of \"World That I See,\" while they exhibit their trademark resilience on \"Tone Poem.\" From its lovely, stripped-down intro, \"Under the Overpass\" (about the homeless) builds to a powerful climax, providing one of the album's highlights, and they work up a good head of steam on the forceful \"Say Your Prayers\" (which, musically, is reminiscent of U2's \"Zoo Station\").

The Oil's led by singer Peter Garrett was often outspoken on other political issues, especially around the environment, and the band went on to further success around the world until coming to an end in 2002, when he decided to run for political office in Australia's federal government, where he served in several roles including Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. So the announcement that the band would play 77 concerts on The Great Circle World Tour, playing on 6 of earth's 7 continents was big news.</p><p>Thankfully, after 14 dormant years, someone thought that they should film and record one of the tour's final dates, not just for posterity but also for those of us fans who were unable to get to city they were playing (speaking personally). Armistice Day: Live At The Domain, Sydney, was filmed for release both on DVD and Blu-Ray, and there's an audio version, a 26 two-CD set (from which this review was written). One thing needs to be said right up front: this does not sound like a band of elder statesmen who once played in a rock & roll band, but took 14 years off to pursue other interests, and just got back together for a nostalgia tour, and to make some extra cash to cover their retirement. No, far from it. Midnight Oil in 2018 sounds just as potent, energetic and relevant as they did when I caught them on tour a couple times in the late 80's. If anything, drummer Rob Hirst and guitarists Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey are attacking these songs with brutal force for a hometown Sydney crowd, as if to prove the point that this has always been a band that embodied the spirit of one of their best songs, \"Power And The Passion.\"</p><p>And given the long time off, it's important to point out that this is pretty much the original 5-piece band, with the addition of bass player Bones Hillman, who came on board in 1987, and an additional backing musician, Jack Howard of the band Hunters & Collectors, who added keyboards, trumpet and flugelhorn, and didgeridoo on tour and for this show brought along the H&C horn section for tracks like \"Power And The Passion.\" That last one is the long, wooden \"drone pipe,\" a traditional instrument of the Aboriginal people of Australia, comes in handing on songs like \"Treaty,\" where the Oils are joined by guest vocalist Yirrmal, an indigenous Australian artist.</p><p>Recorded on Armistice Day, November 11, 2017, and released a full year later, appropriately opens with the Midnight Oil song of the same name, the global celebration for the end of War to End All Wars, WWI, which is celebrated in the U.S. as Veterans' Day. All the bands hits are here, as you'd expect, \"Beds Are Burning\", \"The Dead Heart\" and \"Dreamworld\" from \"Diesel and Dust\", the title track from that album's follow-up, \"Blue Sky Mine\", and it's other singles, \"Forgotten Years\" and \"King of the Mountain\" and a few other songs that got airplay outside of their homeland, like \"Truganini\", \"Redneck Wonderland\" and \"Golden Age.\"</p><p>But, of course, like most bands, Midnight Oil is most-loved and most successful in their native Australia, where fans are far more familiar with their complete 11 studio album catalog, so lots of the songs, lesser known here, got a great response from the hometown crowd, singing along with Garrett on \"Power and the Passion,\" \"King of the Mountain\", \"Ships of Freedom\" and \"U.S. Forces\", which of course is a song protesting U.S. policies, the CIA and \"bombs and threats\". In many ways, the social justice themes of Midnight Oil's music is captured in the lyrics of \"Warakurna\", which state that \"there is enough for everyone\", and an acknowledgement that the very land that they live on really belongs to the indigenous people who were there before the Europeans arrived, which is true in many places of the colonized world. While there's no spoken commentary on the audio, no doubt one factor bringing Midnight Oil back at this time in the world's devolution, is to speak out about concern over climate change, and the growing influence of nationalism, in that sense this band's music is as timely and important as ever.</p><p>But finally, like any other rock band, it's the music that matters, and Midnight Oil delivers. Much of the time this band rocks, and rocks hard, as heard in the brutal riffs of \"Redneck Wonderland\", the torrential bass line of \"Stand In Line\", the dominating combination of Hirst's driving snare beat, and the interwoven guitars of Rotsey and Moginie, but they keep things interesting throughout with artful additions like Garrett's harmonica on \"Blue Sky Mine\", \"Truganini\" and \"Kosciuszko\" which starts off like an acoustic folk song but then is taken over by drums, or the lengthy piano break in \"Short Memory\".  In 2017, Midnight Oil was as vital as ever, and they've announced more tour dates for summer of 2019, evidently that \"Power And the Passion\" lives on.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Brian Newcomb</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Apart Together is the first traditional studio album by Australia's Tim Minchin, who built his reputation over the previous two decades as an award-winning comedian, actor, and composer/lyricist. Known for the stage musicals Matilda and Groundhog Day (both Olivier Award winners for Best New Musical) as well as for the comedic songs of his standup act, he alternates humor and earnestness on an album that reflects on four ultimately frustrating years spent living and working in Los Angeles before he moved to Sydney in 2018. Recorded with a host of studio musicians and multiple orchestrators, Apart Together comes off a lot like a rock opera, both in its scale and its mix of rousing power ballads and playful piano rock. A track that falls somewhere in between is \"Leaving LA.\" A narrative piece, it combines poignant melodies, cynical remembrances, and wordplay like \"a stoned Emma Stone\" and \"I've seen your sport and I don't wanna play.\" The livelier \"Talked Too Much, Stayed Too Long\" opts for a strutting, bluesy, funky rock, as Minchin, punctuated by female backing vocals, recalls playing keyboards in various clubs throughout his life. Elsewhere, the related \"Airport Piano\" settles into a catchy, Elton John-like pop/rock to set an evocative scene. While most of the album incorporates humor, he keeps things relatively sincere on songs including the title track and \"I'll Take Lonely Tonight,\" a wistful, piano-based hotel ballad with only gentle, atmospheric accompaniment until it breaks open at the end. If moody and, for better or worse, steeped in theatrical instincts, Apart Together successfully captures the dissatisfaction of a writer separated from family in a grasping city. In fact, its overarching narrative and vivid imagery could have the makings of a show.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Marcy Donelson</strong></p><hr/><p>The separation of performers from fans has been no laughing matter this year. Nowhere is that more audible than here, on Tim Minchin's first-ever studio album. Over 15 years, live in concert, he's recorded half a dozen collections of his scathing, satirical, self-deprecating, often brilliantly witty songs. His audiences adore him, and he bounces off them with the comic timing of a razor-sharp wordsmith alert to their every giggle and gasp.</p><p>Apart Together misses them enormously. For starters, the conversational charm is replaced by the echo-chamber affectations of A Guy Making A Record. Between his copious world travels and the stage musical characters the composer must inhabit for smash musicals like Matilda and Groundhog Day, it's almost as if he's forgotten how he might pronounce words like \"Sydney\" and \"miserable\" in normal conditions.</p><p>But it's the album's overarching theme that's most troublesome. \"A nervous narcissistic best man at a long and slightly ponderous wedding\" was Minchin's self-scripted introduction to the monologue-heavy launch performance streamed on Thursday night.</p><p>It's fair to say that compared to the more or less objective targets of his best work – God, shysters, redheads, inflatable lovers, popes, Christmas, Cardinal Pell – the personal tribulations of the mega-successful jet-setting entertainer's lifestyle don't resonate with his usual zing.</p><p>In his rather less economical Ben Folds way, he does hit the universal bullseyes of death and love in Apart Together and Carry You, the latter of which is a moving song of frailty and devotion as beautifully covered previously by Missy Higgins.</p><p>The Absence of You hits the plaintive keynote, humblebragging about a lonely wander from Pont Neuf to St Germain; watching the sunrise from the 30th floor of a Central Park hotel; taking morning coffee and newspapers in Soho Square, then soaring to an absurdly orchestrated chorus about the meaninglessness of it all.</p><p>The epic production job is more confetti-canon Broadway finale than crestfallen introspection: studio as folly rather than friend. The near-seven minutes of I'll Take Lonely Tonight ups those stakes with a stupendous climax celebrating the fact that, despite temptation, our pissed-up protagonist has opted not to cheat on his girl back home. Cheers! (Runs up minibar tab instead.)</p><p>Minchin's \"I\" might not always mean \"me\", but whoever sits in judgment of ladies in Porsches, ski-resort dads, bankers' wives named Bianca and other high-flying elites while frittering an idle hour on the Airport Piano shows a curious lack of self-awareness.</p><p>The trouble is that this time, by his own admission, Minchin isn't joking. The rapier wit is only ever half-sheathed, but even in the imagined last rites of If This Plane Goes Down (yes, lots of planes here), the impending carnage is all about this one guy in the centre of the storm.</p><p>Minchin's path hasn't all been roses. He suffered, for instance, a major Hollywood project being shelved a few years ago. The upshot of that is Leaving LA, in which he declares his raging boredom with all the glamorous locales many listeners would love to visit, just once, while torching the lot in a fit of the sourest grapes.</p><p>Going back to that narcissism thing though. It is, old timers will recall, a fairly new development in song craft. Didn't the masters strive to transcend the strictly personal to resonate eternal? Today, spoon-fed entitlement from self-obsessed idols, each new generation of singer-songwriters seems to feel more comfortable bedding down in the moist lint of their own navels.</p><p>Tragically and wonderfully, the tools to write and record are as close as their mouse. A tiny fraction of them get to travel the world, win big awards and make tonnes of money from adoring fans. Surely those lucky few owe us more than, I went to Paris and all I got was this lousy heartache?</p><p>\"Here lies a clown who wrote some songs/ He talked too much and stayed too long,\" Minchin sings of himself, in one of the album's less serious slaloms of exacting wordplay: a long and slightly ponderous memoir spanning Perth to Melbourne, Edinburgh, Broadway and (did he mention?) Hollywood.</p><p>No Tim Minchin fan will think that when he is sadly laid to rest. But given all of his early, funny songs, it might not be these they'll remember.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Dwyer</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In the months prior to the passing of legendary jazz bassist Charles Mingus, Joni Mitchell had been personally summoned by the bop pioneer to collaborate on a musical version of T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets. The project would entail Mitchell to condense the text for Mingus to score instrumentally. He planned on utilizing a full orchestra, as well as the more traditional guitar and bass. They would accompany Mitchell's vocals and the narration of selected portions of the text. After a few weeks of consideration, Mitchell's reaction was that \"[she]'d rather condense the bible.\" Mingus then bestowed Mitchell with six melodies -- \"Joni I\" through \"Joni VI\" -- penned specifically for her. Mitchell spent a few weeks with Mingus -- who was totally immobilized from amyotropic lateral sclerosis (aka Lou Gehrig's Disease) -- during the spring of 1978. Their partnership advanced the half-dozen tunes. More importantly, it shook Mitchell from a three-month long writer's block/drought -- yielding two of her best late-'70s compositions: \"God Must Be a Boogie Man\" and the revisitation and completion of a track she'd been wood-shedding, now titled \"The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey.\" Incidentally, the former piece was inspired by the opening chapters of Mingus' autobiography, Beneath the Underdog. Initial recordings during Mitchell's stay with Mingus in New York City produced several interesting experimental sessions with the likes of Stanley Clarke (bass), Jan Hammer (keyboards), John McLaughlin (guitar), Gerry Mulligan (baritone sax), and Tony Williams (drums). A few of these recordings -- while rumored to have been lost, destroyed, or made otherwise unavailable -- were leaked into the trading community in the late '90s. Arguably, Mitchell could not have chosen any finer musicians than the sextet she ultimately incorporated into this work. The luminaries include Herbie Hancock (electric piano), Wayne Shorter (soprano sax), Jaco Pastorious (bass/horn arrangements), Peter Erskine (drums), Don Alias (congas), and Emil Richards (percussion). Sprinkled amongst these soulfully jazzy pieces are five \"raps,\" or aural snapshots of the time Mitchell and Mingus spent together. Sadly, Charles Mingus passed before he was able to listen to this timeless and ageless paean to his remarkable contributions to bop and free jazz.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

As expected, she assembles a group of all-star musicians including Pat Metheny (guitar), Jaco Pastorius (bass), Lyle Mays (keyboards), and Michael Brecker (saxophone) who give these compositions more energy than on the studio recordings. The musicians are given room to jam, and they sound terrific on uptempo songs such as \"Coyote\" and \"In France They Kiss on Main Street.\" If there is a general theme of these songs, it's about growing older and maturing after the failed idealism of the late '60s (the album opens with audio clips from the movie Rebel Without a Cause). Although this album is pleasing, the live arrangements are not different enough from the studio versions to warrant higher marks. In fact, Mitchell has always been an album artist who recorded studio albums that had a sound and feel all their own. While Shadows and Light provides a nice summary of her experimental period for casual fans, interested listeners should start with Hejira or The Hissing of Summer Lawns.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Vik Iyengar</strong></p>"

In the brief opener, \"Sunny Sunday,\" a woman tries to shoot out a streetlight with a pistol and misses every night, a metaphor for the individual's futile struggle against civilization, and Mitchell repeats much the same message in songs like \"Sex Kills,\" a generalized criticism of everything from lawyers to the hole in the ozone layer; \"Turbulent Indigo,\" which describes the inability of people to understand artists; \"Last Chance Lost,\" which treats romantic disappointment; and \"Not to Blame,\" about spousal abuse. The low-key music and restrained vocals stand in contrast to the lyrics -- over and over, Mitchell's imagery refers to guns and violence. Turbulent Indigo provides a disturbing view of modern life made all the more compelling by its calm presentation.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong</p>>"

		"review": "This aptly titled triple-disc compilation examines Thelonious Monk's final years as an active recording artist. <i>The Columbia Years: 1962-1968</i> is a superior primer for those seeking a thorough overview of this fertile, expressive, and oft-maligned period of Monk's career. In addition to embracing the bright moments from Monk's early- to mid-'60s studio and live releases, compilation producer Orrin Keepnews -- Thelonious' original recording producer during his formidable tenure on the Riverside label -- has included several restored performances and a few previously unissued pieces as well. <i>The Columbia Years: 1962-1968</i> is subdivided into \"studio\" and \"live\" performances with each musical configuration represented. These include Monk as a soloist, in a trio, a quartet, and in a big-band context. These varied settings further augment Thelonious Monk as not only an instinctual presence on the keyboard, but as a craftsman of timeless melody, harmony, and rhythmic counterpoint. \"Think of One,\" \"Blue Monk,\" and a solo \"Don't Blame Me\" are among the newly mined treasures exclusive to <i>The Columbia Years: 1962-1968</i>. As one might presume, there are no icon-shattering discoveries among the restorations or debut releases. In their stead is a resurrection of the brilliant sound lost on previous cassette and poorly mastered CD releases. Particularly notable are the live tracks with their tangible electric vibe. \"Straight, No Chaser\" -- taken from the September 1964 Monterey Jazz Festival -- draws the listener into its confidence with satisfying crispness and warmth. Likewise, \"Evidence\" and \"Epistrophy\" -- taken from the soundtrack of the award-winning documentary film Straight, No Chaser -- no longer sound out of phase. In fact, the contrary would be more accurate. The conclusion of Thelonious Monk's brilliant recording career is lovingly captured on this box set. His inventive wisdom and candid spirit shine through every note.</p>&mdash; <b>Lindsay Planer</b>"

		"review": "<p>After a brief return to his hard rock roots in 2002's Scars, guitarist Gary Moore comes back to the blues where his heart seems to be. But really, Moore's forte is his knack of combining the meaty licks and rugged tone from his gutsy rock to energize the electric blues music he has embraced since 1990's Still Got the Blues. To that end, Scars' drummer Darrin Mooney returns and Bob Daisley, veteran of such thundering outfits as Ozzy Osbourne's band, Uriah Heep and Rainbow, joins on bass. Hence this album's title is appropriate, since the power trio format pounds out this music with clenched-fist authority. Moore is an exceptionally tasty musician but even when the amps are turned up to eleven, as they are for most of this disc, there is feeling in his fiery licks. The originals that dominate are little more than rewritten established blues riffs and his songs are predominantly vehicles for his explosive, wah-wah-heavy attacks. Covers of Willie Dixon's \"Evil\" and \"I Can't Quit You Baby\" don't take the tunes anywhere they haven't been before (the latter copies Led Zeppelin's version almost down to the note) but Moore wrings enough guts out of them to make his renderings well-worth hearing, if not essential. A crawling take on Percy Mayfield's \"Memory Pain\" drags the standard on to Moore's playing field, but maintains the original's sense of sorrow. The guitarist's understated imprint is also evident on ballads like \"That's Why I Play the Blues\" where his low-key vocals and lighter touch are surprisingly poignant. He seems to be having a ball throughout, singing and playing with the loose authority that only 35 years as a professional musician allows. Moore is especially convincing and enthusiastic on the jazzy, walking bass propelled \"Can't Find My Baby,\" a nice change-up from the album's predominantly charging tone. The creeping menace of the closing \"Torn Inside\" also shows how Moore uses subtle dynamics and a less-is-more tactic borrowed from his mentor Peter Green, to ramp up the drama. There's nothing here Moore hasn't done previously, but it's another stellar entry into his bulging catalog and a great place for hard rock fans to jump aboard the blues train.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Six years after his successful tribute to Peter Green, Gary Moore follows with another solid electric blues-rock effort that falls squarely in line with his similarly themed albums Still Got the Blues, After Hours, and Blues Alive. Although he adds brass on a rollicking version of B.B. King's \"You Upset Me Baby,\" Moore predominantly sticks to the basics here, pounding out energetic and full-bodied blues-rock and leading a stripped-down trio with a journeyman's enthusiasm and his trademark thick, sustained guitar solos slashing through the proceedings. The majority of the tracks are originals, although even the best of them sound suspiciously like rewritten blues standards. \"Cold Black Night\" is little more than a speeded-up \"Messin' With the Kid,\" and \"Picture of the Moon\" sounds awfully similar to Moore's own \"Still Got the Blues.\" And whether the world needs yet another version of \"Stormy Monday\" or \"I Ain't Got You\" is debatable. But Moore pulls off even the most clichéd material with his phenomenal prowess; supple, identifiable vocals; and a guitar tone that effortlessly shifts from a Santana/Peter Green-styled hovering intensity to a slashing Stevie Ray Vaughan attack. While Moore isn't redefining the genre or even his own approach to it, he's adding his stamp to blues-rock with Back to the Blues. Consistently rugged, moving, and heartfelt, the album is a reminder that even without reinventing an established musical style, an artist can effectively work within its boundaries to produce a satisfying, if not quite fresh, interpretation relying solely on talent and passion.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Hal Horowitz</strong></p>"

Old New Ballads Blues is exactly what the title says it is, a mix of old blues (covers of songs by Elmore James, Willie Dixon, and Otis Rush), new blues (five Moore originals), ballads (half the album) and, well, blues (by one definition or another, everything here passes for blues). The real surprise is that the strongest songs are the original Moore-penned ballads, as Moore gives powerful and atmospheric performances (both vocally and as a guitarist) on \"Gonna Rain Today,\" \"No Reason to Cry,\" and a solid horn-augmented remake of one of his best songs, \"Midnight Blues,\" from what is easily his best album, 1990s million-selling Still Got the Blues. The James and Dixon covers (\"Done Something Wrong\" and \"You Know My Love\" respectively) seem disappointingly by-the-numbers, while the Rush song, \"All Your Love,\" fares a bit better, but Moore's own compositions shine brightest here, giving him plenty of room to weep on the old Les Paul, which is a very good thing, since vocals have never been Moore's strongest suit and his lyrics are often on the slight side. All of that vanishes when his guitar takes over a song, and on the instrumental \"Cut It Out,\" Moore's muscular guitar tone says as much or more about life inside the blues as any of the vocal numbers.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Leggett</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Astral Weeks is generally considered one of the best albums in pop music history. For all that renown, Astral Weeks is anything but an archetypal rock & roll album: in fact, it isn't a rock & roll album at all. Employing a mixture of folk, blues, jazz, and classical music, Van Morrison spins out a series of extended ruminations on his Belfast upbringing, including the remarkable character \"Madame George\" and the climactic epiphany experienced on \"Cyprus Avenue.\" Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Morrison sings in his elastic, bluesy voice, accompanied by a jazz rhythm section (Jay Berliner, guitar, Richard Davis, bass, Connie Kay, drums), plus reeds (John Payne) and vibes (Warren Smith, Jr.), with a string quartet overdubbed. An emotional outpouring cast in delicate musical structures, Astral Weeks has a unique musical power. Unlike any record before or since, it nevertheless encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music, easily justifying the critics' raves.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p><hr/><p>Van Morrison released Astral Weeks in November 1968, not even 18 months after cracking the Billboard Top 10 with \"Brown Eyed Girl\". Much of the ebullience of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" derives from its AM-radio friendly arrangement, a sound encouraged by Bert Berns, the head of Van's label Bang. Berns was determined to get the record on the charts because that's where the money was, so the single sounded peppier than its lyric, a disconnect Morrison later noted. An undercurrent of melancholy desire runs through \"Brown Eyed Girl\"&mdash;Van pines for a moment as it's passing&mdash;and Astral Weeks brings that yearning to the forefront as it ventures into the slipstream of memories, dreams, and regret.</p><p>eneralized longing&mdash;for a lover or a friend, for a certain time or place, for a younger version of yourself&mdash;is one of the defining elements of Astral Weeks, an album where spirituality, mysticism, and death intertwine on a vast expanding plane. It is youthful and old, the first flowering of expanded consciousness, one not yet tarnished by either tragedy or cynicism but impeded by an encroaching sense of mortality. Death flows through the album but doom doesn't cloud each moment. Rather, this music comes from the perspective of a young man realizing everything he has will erode, an awareness arriving while the wonder of life has yet to fade. Morrison doesn't dwell upon such sadness so much as he brushes upon them, a sensibility mirrored in his open-ended songs&mdash;compositions that largely evade traditional structure in favor of a boundless ballad, one stripped of story but following an interior emotional narrative. There's reason why both its creator and admirers so often call Astral Weeks poetry: it has its own internal language.</p><p>Other singer/songwriters wound up using Astral Weeks as a primary text, either discovering their own voice in its viaducts or wallowing in its detours, but nobody has approached its soft, untethered spirituality, not even Van Morrison himself. In a way, Morrison's occasional disregard for the record helped fuel its cult, suggesting he tapped into a vein that frightened even him (this is a common thread among cult albums, where audiences choose to live eternally within a few dark months of an artist's life; see also Big Star's Third or Weezer's Pinkerton). Certainly, Astral Weeks seems to exist in a separate dimension from the rest of Van Morrison's catalog, its supple, soft-focus jazz-folk lacking the deeper R&B grooves of so many of his records, while its songs are often absent on compilations (tellingly, there's not a single song from it on the artist-endorsed 2007 compilation, Still on Top&mdash;The Greatest Hits). All of which underscores its separateness, playing into the myths that Astral Weeks is a record out of time and place.</p><p>But even this, the most mystical album in the classic rock canon, has prosaic beginnings. Although it gives the illusion that it was written as a piece, several of its songs were composed years earlier (\"Ballerina\" dates from 1966, when Them recorded a prescient version of Dylan's \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\"), with Morrison recording two of the songs&mdash;\"Beside You\" and \"Madame George\"&mdash;for Bang Records during a day-long 1967 session designed to deliver all 36 songs he owed the label. This patchwork assemblage wasn't an accident. Part of the condition for Morrison's departure from the imprint dictated that he record two Bang-era songs for his Warner debut and, if Morrison released a single in 1968, half of the copyright would belong to Berns' publishing company. Morrison had radio-friendly material at the ready&mdash;\"Domino\", the lead single from the subsequent His Band and the Street Choir, was kicking around in '68&mdash;but he deliberately saved these songs for a later date, choosing contemplative compositions that were frankly uncommercial. Critics and Morrison himself would occasionally lament the album's lack of promotion but that underselling seems a deliberate tactic: there were no singles by design and both the artist and Warner would benefit financially if the hits arrived somewhere down the road.</p><p>Hence, Astral Weeks is a bit of conventional artist building by Warner, a label known for being artist-friendly. Where Bang sought to shoehorn Morrison into the confines of AM radio, Warner's Mo Ostin and Joe Smith indulged their new signing, teaming him with producer Lewis Merenstein, who recruited a band of jazz players led by bassist Richard Davis, a veteran of out sessions by Andrew Hill (he played on every one of the pianist's pivotal mid-'60s Blue Note titles) and Eric Dolphy, but also straighter sessions by Brother Jack McDuff and Lou Donaldson. Modern Jazz Quartet drummer Connie Kay came next, along with guitarist Jay Berliner and vibraphonist/percussionist Warren Smith Jr., both veterans of sessions with Charles Mingus, and the group simply followed the lead of Morrison, who was playing the songs while sequestered in his separate booth. Three days&mdash;just two longer than the Bang copyright dump&mdash;was all that was needed to finish the record, with four songs completed the first day of the session. Morrison later told NPR in 2009 \"That was that performance on those days\" and, in a way, that's all that needs to be said about the record: it is musicians, previously unknown to each other, discovering a shared vernacular, stumbling upon something transcendent that no party attempted to conjure again.</p><p>Astral Weeks is defined by Morrison's transient collaborations, not only between the musicians in the studio but producer Merenstein. So distinct is its atmosphere, it's easy to assume this is the work of a lone auteur who crafted the compositions and arrangements, but Merenstein is the one who sequenced the album, imposing the designations \"In the Beginning\" and \"Afterwards\" to the two sides, thereby strengthening the illusion that this is a song cycle. He's also the one who directed the orchestrations and chose to clip \"Slim Slow Slider\" so the album shudders to a halt, the dream coming to a conclusion with a start.</p><p>The long-rumored complete version of \"Slim Slow Slider\" is one of four bonus tracks added to Warner's new remastered and expanded reissue of Astral Weeks; the other three include a longer version of \"Ballerina\" and alternate takes on \"Beside You\" and \"Madame George\", the latter with no orchestration and heavy vibes, offering a muted variation on the original. \"Slim Slow Slider\" does feel different in its lengthier incarnation, where it now glides to a gentler conclusion with Morrison trading lines with John Payne's saxophone, an effect that lends a slightly hopeful edge to an otherwise harrowing song. Perhaps this is closer to the author's intent&mdash;when Morrison performed Astral Weeks live at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009 he inserted the song in the middle of the set, softening its impact&mdash;or perhaps not; as Van says, either album is nothing more than a snapshot of a moment, the way those songs were performed on that day by that singer. This essential ephemera means this longer version of \"Slim Slow Slider\", along with its companion alternate takes, are mere grace notes to an album that ultimately can not be illuminated, only experienced.</p><p>His Band and the Street Choir, the other Van Morrison album receiving an expanded treatment in this inaugural series of deluxe reissues, stands as something of a counter to the heady Astral Weeks: it is all about the rough and tumble joy of living. Delivered almost immediately after the breakthrough of Moondance&mdash;that record came out in January 1970, His Band arrived in November of that year&mdash;His Band and the Street Choir is the first of Morrison's albums where the production is credited entirely to the man himself. He elbowed Merenstein aside during the recording of Moondance when the producer sought to bring in the Astral Weeks band for a second round&mdash;the veteran retained an executive producer credit&mdash;and Morrison labored over that album, recording for three months and work-shopping material in the studio.</p><p>**His Band and the Street Choir bore a similarly lengthy creative process but the album gives an illusion of buoyant immediacy thanks in no small part to its heavy R&B kick. Where Moondance traded in jazz&mdash;even its liveliest moment was named after a Duke Ellington song&mdash;His Band and the Street Choir relied on soul and gospel, using folk almost as an accent. \"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\" and \"Virgo Clowns\" almost offer respites from the raucous rhythms of \"Domino\", \"Blue Money\", and \"Call Me Up in Dreamland\", songs that sound joyous no matter what their topic (and, in the case of the two singles, they're likely about separation and nude modeling, not exactly rousing topics). When Morrison claimed Astral Weeks sounded \"samey\" in latter-day interviews, he had a point: it was variations on a theme, whereas His Band and the Street Choir shoehorns celebration, sweet melancholy, and reflection into 12 songs. Perhaps this doesn't make for a spiritually transcendent record but it is an album of sustenance, providing sustained pleasures for times of joy and sorrow.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Payin' Dues was the first album to combine the previously released recordings Morrison made for Bang Records at the start of his solo career (some of which were issued initially on the album Blowin' Your Mind! in 1967, including the Top Ten hit \"Brown Eyed Girl\") with a bizarre collection of off-the-cuff musical performances Morrison made, strumming an acoustic guitar and seemingly singing whatever came into his head, apparently in order to fulfill the terms of his Bang contract. Early on in this one-of-a-kind improvisation, credited as a 35-plus-minute \"Jamming Session\" on the album cover, but actually broken down into individual tracks on the second disc, Morrison seems to be trying at least half-heartedly to come up with songs, but by the 14th fragment he has started singing about how he's waiting for his royalty check. After that, things get really strange. Twenty-two tracks in, he is giving his own potted history of his career on Bang, derisively referring to his album, with its psychedelic cover, as \"Blowin' Your Nose,\" then \"Nosin' Your Blow.\" It has to be heard to be believed. The first disc contains some valuable early Morrison material, including versions of \"Beside You\" and \"Madame George,\" later to turn up on the 1968 masterpiece Astral Weeks. But the \"Jamming Session\" is a hoot.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

With Mark Isham's lonely muted trumpet up front, listeners are in the jazz world immediately with \"Haunts of Ancient Peace,\" merging perfectly with Morrison's idiosyncratic vocal style. A low-pressure soul-jazz organ riff lays down the base of the most easily assimilated track, \"Satisfied,\" as Morrison's lyric indicates that he has reached a state of internal peace. \"Wild Honey\" has R&B horn riffs over Philly-style strings, while \"Spirit\" mostly pursues a self-fulfillment path similar to that of \"Satisfied.\" Ultimately, the record stands or falls upon two remarkable, gigantic 15-minute pieces, \"Summertime in England\" and \"When Heart Is Open.\" The propulsive opening of \"Summertime\" drops names of Morrison's favorite poets and authors; the track teeters upon indulgence but you are drawn in by Morrison's obsessions with lines and phrases like \"common one\" and \"let your red robe go,\" his voice becoming a twin brother of arranger Pee Wee Ellis' riffing sax. Lonely horns over the hilltops open \"When Heart Is Open,\" and it begins to resemble a sequel to Miles Davis' treatment of \"In a Silent Way,\" setting a peaceful, mesmerizing mood that carries you through its enormous length to the end of the record. No wonder the rock critics of the time didn't get it; this is music outside the pop mainstream, and even Morrison's own earlier musical territory.

Its latest offering revisits two classic Van Morrison concerts culled from the famous jazz festival of the same name, resulting in a deluxe double disc with extensive liner notes. Believe it or not, Morrison has never released an official concert DVD until now, previously only appearing in various VHS incarnations or television specials. While this conversion of sets from 1974 and 1980 may have been long overdue, the collection is well worth the wait (especially in a day in age when this particular performer is charging higher ticket prices and playing less material).</p><p>The 1980 performance is actually the best of the pair, if only for its expanded set list and treatment of Morrison's more notable cuts. Along with a sterling backing band laced in soul, R&B, jazz and pop, he nestles into muscular versions of \"Wavelength\" and \"Kingdom Hall,\" demonstrating lead guitar licks and rich vocal presentation. \"Moondance\" is particularly magical, carrying on with ample band improv that thankfully never becomes overly extravagant, while \"Wild Night\" is a smoky rave up that puts to shame John Mellencamp's mediocre comeback cover. The concert concludes with \"Angelou,\" a slow jazz jam that mounts with remarkable passion and beauty, simmering out the exceptional evening on a tender note.</p><p>Dipping back even further in time is the 1974 disc, a much shorter offering with only nine songs, but one that's still vital, showcasing an even younger, more spirited Morrison. The digital restoration and new remixes are especially evident on this piece of vintage footage, which also encompasses several of the singer/songwriter's earlier chestnuts, such as the high pitched powerhouse \"Twilight Zone,\" the horn heavy \"Heathrow Shuffle\" and the husky handed \"Naked In the Jungle.\" While more casual fans will miss \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and the recurring live romp \"Gloria,\" there's still plenty to savor in this impressive package. It will also take faithful followers back to the days when Morrison was a little more spontaneous and lively as a showman (long before the days of diva-like behavior or uneven album output), cementing his place as a pioneering blue-eyed soul force.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Andy Argyrakis</strong></p>"

Still, this winds up being a stronger articulation of what Morrison was attempting to do on Common One — much like how Wavelength got A Period of Transition right. That doesn't mean that this is a particularly easy album to warm to, since Morrison seems to be consciously creating an insular world here, only of interest to those willing to delve deeply into his own world, letting his elliptical melodies charm instead of frustrate, to let the leisurely pace seduce rather than lull. Once you do that, the record reveals such charming moments as \"She Gives Me Religion,\" \"Beautiful Vision,\" and \"Cleaning Windows,\" a skipping light R&amp;B tune that became one of his latter-day standards. Too much of Beautiful Vision is the product of a willfully idiosyncratic yet oddly measured vision to make it essential for anyone other than diehards, but moments such as that make it worth a listen.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

Morrisonand Moloney's production puts the vocals up front with a sparse background, sometimes with a backdrop of intertwining strings and flutes, the same way Morrison would later use the Chieftains on his Hymns to the Silence. The arrangement and the artist's engaged singing leads to a brilliant result, and these Irish classics are made very accessible without being transformed into pop songs. Of the ten tracks included, eight are Irish trads. The title track and \"Celtic Ray\" are written by Morrison, and also appear on Beautiful Vision and Inarticulate Speech of the Heart, but since they are written in a pseudo traditional style, the folksy treatment given them by the Chieftains makes these versions sound as if they were the originals.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Lars Lovén</strong></p>"

(His fans concurred; the album was his highest-charting effort in more than 20 years and earned a gold record.) He then took an uncharacteristically long three years to make a new original album, though he produced two side projects, the live Skiffle Sessions: Live in Belfast 1998 and You Win Again, a duet record with Linda Gail Lewis, in between. Down the Road is not bitter, but it does look to the past continually and with longing. Musically, it mixes R&B and jazz with bits of country (especially on \"What Makes the Irish Heart Beat\") and folk, all conjured from the singer's 1950s youth. Lyrically, it deliberately makes use of blues clichés and catch phrases to tell its tales of struggle, recollection, and regret. The album cover depicts the front of a record store, Music and Memorabilia, with a window full of LP covers by blues, R&B, jazz, and old rock & roll artists, and the music inside corresponds to that picture, in spirit if not always in style. A key song, and a curious one, is \"Whatever Happened to PJ Proby?,\" in which Morrison identifies himself with trendy British pop singers of the early '60s, including Scott Walker and Screaming Lord Sutch. It's hard to imagine that he really thinks he belongs in their company, but he seems both sincere and pained as he concludes, \"And whatever happened to me?\" If such humility is sincere, it may help explain why Morrison has rejected the trappings of fame all these years, and it makes him all the more endearing.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Unfortunately, the compilers resorted several times to live versions of popular Morrison tunes rather than the studio versions that were actually used in the films. Thus, classic Morrison tracks such as \"Domino,\" \"Into the Mystic,\" \"Moondance\" (this version is previously unreleased), and \"Caravan,\" while technically representing certain films, are also cheats.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jeff Tamarkin</strong></p>"

Nor should it be assumed that this is a collection of great songs that he's written in that decade-and-a-half, since this is chock-full of covers, including revivals of songs he recorded throughout his career. Furthermore, a full 14 songs -- the length of the first disc of this comp -- are credited as collaborations, and include some previously unreleased cuts that can be counted among a handful of rarities here. It's idiosyncratic, which perhaps could be expected from any comp assembled by the artist himself, but it's also accurate, and it helps makes sense of a rather odd stretch of album-making in a way that's necessary. Taken one at a time, Van's excursions into jazz, country, even skiffle seemed odd, but condensed into this 31-track set, it not only makes sense, it makes an argument that Van has been more true -- if not necessarily vital -- than many of his peers in his latter days. Instead of churning out songs that he's not inspired to write, he's relying on standards to find himself, and finding more inspiration in singing with others than flying solo. As individual records, some of these albums were bewildering, some were quite wonderful, but excerpted and sculpted into something resembling a testimonial, if not a narrative, it's easier to understand what Morrison was up to during a span where he never delivered one album as acclaimed or vital as Dylan or Young (or even McCartney or the Stones), but this goes a long way to proving that hardly means he stopped making good music. If anything, listening to his music in this fashion makes a strong argument for the value of this decade-and-a-half of recording better than any individual Van album from this time, so it's as worthy a listen for those fans who have followed him loyally over these 15 years as it is for those who bowed out around the time of the last The Best of Van Morrison.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

There is a bona fide alternate take of \"The Healing Game\" that sounds more like a well-executed demo and has plenty of Celtic soul. \"Someone Like You\" is here, as is \"Wavelength,\" and some tunes that deserved far better than they got: \"Tore Down à la Rimbaud,\" \"Real Real Gone,\" \"Bright Side of the Road,\" \"Days Like This,\" and \"Stranded.\" The early tunes are immediately recognizable, from \"Brown Eyed Girl,\" \"Gloria,\" \"Here Comes the Night,\" \"Domino,\" \"Moondance,\" \"Wild Night,\" and \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm In Heaven).\" In sum, as far as the many repackaged greatest hits, this is one of the better ones as it is cross-licensed and contains a true evolutionary portrait of the artist on a journey that certainly winds and turns back on itself even as it moves forward. This is a good one with fine sound. [Polydor's 2007 Canadian edition added 16 tracks across its two-CD set.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>When an artist decides to perform a classic album in concert, the possibilities for disaster are myriad. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks had never been performed as a cycle before these performances at the Hollywood Bowl. With only one full band rehearsal, Van responded by bringing this mythic material to life with a rock showman's sense of audacity, a poet's vulnerability, a jazzman's sense of timing, and the mastery of a singer who knows where to find the hidden magic in his material. Morrison took the original track order and shuffled it to make it flow better live. He extended most tunes, turning some into mini-suites while tightening others. His well-seasoned lower register voice turned the wonder of a boy in 1968 into the spiritual receptivity and wisdom of a man who has weathered 40 more seasons of discontent and heartbreak.</p><p>The title track opens the set with that familiar up and down acoustic bassline andJay Berliner's nylon string guitar playing blues and jazz runs as Van keeps the first rhythm guitar chair down.(Berliner was lead guitarist on the original Astral Weeks sessions.) It's a tiny bit faster, but the flow is impeccable as skeletal strings come pouring through in the gaps. There is a beautiful sense of space as Tony Fitzgibbon's violin and viola solos come through in the middle and Richie Buckley's flute hovers from the margins. Morrison lets his players shine; he rises to improve with them, feeling his lyrics anew. He adds more gospel flavor to the tune, which is rooted there anyway with \"I Believe I've Transcended.\" And you believe him. The live mix clicks and crackles; it's raw, full, and immediate, without overdubs.</p><p>The track order changes after \"Beside You.\" It lilts and wanders with beautiful vibe work and Berliner's guitar. The first real surprise is \"Slim Slow Slider,\" the closing cut on the original set is the third one here. The deep sorrow, helplessness, and dread in the tune is captured through melancholy memory, balanced by a sense of the previous, not weighted so much with trouble. But Morrison's present tense protagonist is engulfed in pain and confesses the weight is more than he can bear in the effortless segue called \"I Start Breakin' Down.\" The drama is so arresting the listener can forget to breathe. The blues are heavy, the droning hypnotic Celtic ones that is, and they are never static. \"Sweet Thing,\" and \"The Way Young Lovers Do,\" are placed in succession here; they lock the listener in a breezy yet tight swinging groove. The strings caress Morrison's lyric without sweetness; the guitars create a bridge to deliver a strutting \"Cypress Avenue,\" which is appended seamlessly with the killer bluesy soul of \"You Come Walkin' Down.\" \"Ballerina,\" slows it down again and Morrison delivers his best vocal performance of the evening, though \"Madame George,\" which closes out the Astral Weeks material, is a close second; these cuts are simply an amazing one-two knockout. The band and the singer gel perfectly. There are two amazing encores: a dynamite, even shockingly spiritual autobiographical read of \"Listen to the Lion\" from 1972's Saint Dominic's Preview with saxophones, guitars, and strings all pushing against his vocal that moans and wails and roars before breaking through. The night ends with a sultry, scatting read of the title cut from 1980's Common One.</p><p>Astral Weeks: Live at the Hollywood Bowl is not Astral Weeks, but it's brilliant and emotionally intense; it's honest and spiritually revealing. Morrison not only inhabits these songs 40 years later, but he fully understands them; making for a extremely engaging and necessary document from an artist who still has plenty of fire in his belly.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><p>I loved the idea of Astral Weeks before I loved Astral Weeks. I'm sure I'm not alone. Irishman who sang proto-punk \"Gloria\" and drunken dorm-formal singalong \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and went on to do Moondance goes into a midtown Manhattan studio with top-notch jazz sessionmen. Pours out stream-of-consciousness stuff about love, rebirth, and a pain that passes all understanding, in an impressionistic folk-jazz-blues idiom that transcends existing rock conventions. Nobody buys it. A decade later, Lester Bangs calls Astral Weeks \"a mystical document.\" In 1995, MOJO ranks it the #2 album of all time; eight years later, Rolling Stone ranks it #19; in between, damn thing finally goes gold. To a hopeless romantic, what's not to love?</p><p>Only Astral Weeks the album could live up to Astral Weeks the legend. A 23-year-old Van Morrison howls, he hollers, he cajoles, he grabs hold of the ineffable and caresses its edges, bending and reiterating it like an instrumental virtuoso. Guitarist Jay Berliner (Charles Mingus' The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady), bassist Richard Davis (Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch), and drummer Connie Kay (of the Modern Jazz Quartet) create an improvisatory space for Morrison's haunted freeform meditations; Larry Fallon's overdubs add strings, woodwinds, and harpsichord. You breathe in you breathe out, baby baby baby, way upon way upon, dry your eye your eye your eye, too late to stop now, the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves to love the love that loves to love the love that loves, I know you're dying. The legend is with the album, and the legend is the album.</p><p>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl was a pair of concerts held last year at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, honoring the legendary album (scheduled to be reprised February 27 and 28 at New York's Theater at Madison Square Garden). Now Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl is also an album honoring the shows that honored that legendary album. Sadly, one thing that this record isn't: legendary.</p><p>Astral Weeks was released 40 years, almost to the day, before Van Morrison performed the whole thing live two straight nights last November. \"We did the songs and took them somewhere else. Transcended the originals, if you know what I mean.\" That's Morrison talking to the Associated Press recently. The shows featured guitarist Berliner from the 1968 sessions, along with other previous Morrison collaborators and a full string section; they were generally well-reviewed. As recorded on Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, the performances retain the improvisatory approach from the record, right down to changing the song order-- the all-loving, possibly transvestite-themed, vaguely pro-civil-rights hymn \"Madame George\" now closes, rather than atmospheric mortality rumination \"Slim Slow Slider\". There's much rejoicing.</p><p>I guess you had to be there. On disc, Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl is a bland, bluesy celebration you can afford to miss. Oh, it still consists mostly of great songs-- the two \"bonus\" tracks slightly less so-- performed with skill, and recorded at fine quality, but it's hard to imagine why anyone other than souvenir-seekers or live-music absolutists would need to listen to this more than once as long as the original LP remains in print. An album brave enough to embrace life in all its ugliness and anguish, right on through to its inevitable end, becomes just another document of the rock'n'roll generation's stubborn confidence it will outlive itself. Sort of like those Dick Clark teeth on the cover.</p><p>\"I believe I've transcended,\" Morrison sings on an extended outro to the opening, title track. \"Slim Slow Slider\" is now jammy, incongruously upbeat, fixed in time and place by the live audience-- some guy loudly cheers the song's placement after a newly percussion-crowded \"Beside You\". An ignoble thunk disrupts the harpsichord in the left speaker near the start of \"Cyprus Avenue\", which now inexplicably follows swinger \"The Way Young Lovers Do\"-- and lacks the dramatic, showstopping interlude described by Bangs, documented on 1974's It's Too Late to Stop Now live LP. Morrison's voice here is heavier, still distinguished, but as he slurs his way through the ordinarily sublime verses of \"Sweet Thing\" before breaking off for a superfluous harmonica solo, this much is clear: A work of art can withstand the ages. People never do.</p><p>A high point is \"Ballerina\", the possibly prostitute-themed song where Morrison's voice sounds richer and fuller; his growled \"get on up!\" evokes both James Brown and Morrison's own Brown-esque \"good God!\" barks back in his youth. \"Madame George\" ends with Morrison's communal invocation to \"get on the train\"-- well, actually, it ends with some hokey guy shouting Van Morrison's name over and over into a microphone. Still, better than the drippy bonus track version of \"Listen to the Lion\", originally from St. Dominic's Preview, where the same dude bellows, \"Vaaaan Morrison! The one! The only!\" as a saxophone hits barge-like brown notes. If it sounds like I'm overstating my complaints, it's only because listening side by side with Astral Weeks can't help but magnify them. You don't need Pet Sounds Live, either.</p><p>There's a case to be made that Astral Weeks, the album, never quite captured Astral Weeks, the idea. Morrison has complained about producer Lewis Merenstein's chosen running order. Then again, he has also denigrated his accompanists and described Astral Weeks as a \"rock opera\". The repetitions in Morrison's songs carry over to his discography: Prior to Astral Weeks, he recorded other studio versions of \"Madame George\" and \"Beside You\". A 10-minute \"Slim Slow Slider\" was supposedly edited down to 3:18; nothing's set in stone. OK, so maybe what Astral Weeks represents to so many of us can't be perfectly recorded, whether on vinyl or in 1s and 0s-- definitely not in words. But I can feel it in my bones when I listen to the original album (turn it up, so you know it's got soul). When I listen to Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, I just feel lonely, and old.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Marc Hogan, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Hard rock band Mountain was formed in 1969 by guitarist Leslie West and bassist and former Cream producer Felix Pappalardi. The two met while West was a member of Long Island R&amp;B band the Vagrants, local heroes who never broke nationally; when West left to record the solo album Mountain, Pappalardi produced for him. The results were satisfying enough for the two to form a partnership, and Mountain's first lineup included drummer N.D. Smart and keyboardist Steve Knight. The group played its fourth live performance ever at Woodstock, after which Smart was replaced by Corky Laing.</p><p>Their debut album, 1970's <em>Mountain Climbing</em>, went gold, thanks in part to the hard rock classic \"Mississippi Queen.\" <em>Nantucket Sleighride</em> was equally successful, but the group failed to progress with its next album, and after <em>Mountain Live</em> in 1972, the group broke up. Pappalardi, whose hearing had been damaged by Mountain's excessive in-concert volume, returned to production, while West and Laing teamed up with Cream bassist Jack Bruce under the name West, Bruce &amp; Laing.</p><p>A brief reunion featuring West and Pappalardi from the group's original lineup took place in 1974. In subsequent years, West and Laing revived the group for live shows, sometimes joined by Pappalardi; West also performed with his own Leslie West Band. Pappalardi was shot and killed by his wife in 1983. Two years later, West and Laing regrouped with Mark Clarke on bass and recorded an album before once again calling it quits. Laing served as PolyGram's A&amp;R vice president in Canada between 1989 and 1995. In 1996, he reunited with West and Clarke for a new Mountain album, Man's World. West and Laing teamed up again in 2002 for another album as Mountain, Mystic Fire.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>All Music</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Though some may still consider them Radiohead mimics, obviously Muse continue to strike a nerve with their alternative hard rock audience, here releasing their third album of heavy guitars, haunted harmonics, and paranoid musings in Absolution. Frontman Matt Bellamy and company stick to the same disturbed, and sometimes disturbing, formula that's worked in the past: the emotional intensity and style of Radiohead, a rock thunder descended from Black Sabbath, and the baroque drama of Queen. Longtime producer John Leckie sits this one out, and in steps indie uber-engineer Rich Costey. With Costey manning the desk, the music feels more polished and slick, but less epic and raw. Longtime fans won't miss a beat though, because Bellamy delivers the same Thom Yorke vocal impersonation for which he's known, and continues the same anthemic posturing he's lifted from Freddie Mercury. With song titles and subject matter fueled by fear of the apocalypse, and worries about infidelities and random murders, the subject matter is as gloriously pretentious and lovably unlovable as ever. Newcomers to the band should expect killer guitars reminiscent of jackhammers and chainsaws, bloodcurdling choruses, and, of course, tender passages of falsetto. A recurring motif of racing samplers suggests nothing less than a rock opera version of the score to Koyaanisqatsi, and then there are the occasional spooky moments where funky rhythms mingle with heavy metal guitars, suggesting a progressive Italian zombie flick soundtrack. There's little point in selecting highlights, because other than some slow moments that feel tacked on, there's not much variation in theme or mood. Many listeners will probably prefer to tackle the album in small doses, and only the most headstrong won't require a breather. Muse continue to make unrelenting hardcore art rock; Absolution is a tad cheesy, a bit too grandiose in its ambitions, bursting at the seams with too many ideas, and thus exactly what any Muse fan craves.</p>&mdash; <b>Tim DiGravina</b>"

It's make-up contains all of the elements needed to complete a solid prog album: a heavy intermingling of synthesizer and electric guitar, strong punctuation of both bass and drums, a central concept, and the fusing of rock and classical music, which in this case employs the Sinfonia of London. The eight tracks, centered around Newcastle's urban structure and life in a blue collar society, are as colorful as they are intricate. \"Intermezzo\" from Sibelius' \"Karelia Suite\" and Tchaikovsky's \"Pathetique\" are marvelous examples of classical and rock commingling, with the spotlight focused on Keith Emerson's keyboard virtuosity. The second movement from \"Fantasia\" is a sparkling model of improvisational use containing various rock &amp; roll rhythms and time structures, while the third track entitled \"High Level Fugue 4th Bridge\" was inspired by Guida's \"Prelude and Fugue\" and incorporates assorted jazz techniques and boogie-woogie styles into a classical recipe. \"Country Pie/Brandenburg Concerto, No. 6\" unites Dylan with Bach for a most extraordinary illustration of instrumental creativity. Each example of genre merging is pristine and fluid, making the actual overlapping of multiple styles completely transparent. Five Bridges may rank just a tad below The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack or Ars Longa Vita Brevis on the patience scale, but it does demonstrate how Emerson's work with ELP came into fruition. The reissued CD offers five bonus tracks, including the famed \"America\" and \"The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack,\" taken from the Autumn 1967 - Spring 1968 album. The track titled \"Diary From an Empty Day\" is an archival addition.</p>— <b>Mike DaGagne</b>"

However, this set stands out, not only for its comprehensive nature but also for its sound quality, which is exceptional. The vexing aspect of working with the Nice's Immediate catalog was the lack of first-generation master tapes -- the record company's holdings were scattered to the four winds when it went bankrupt at the dawn of the 1970s, and the closest that anyone got on the early CDs was Sony in the early '90s, with the clean original production masters from the Columbia-distributed Immediate catalog. Castle Communications, however, has finally found what sounds like the real thing, and it makes a world of difference: no background noise, minimal tape hiss, each instrument loud and upfront, and all of the playing sharply delineated even in the busiest passages of the group's most complex works. What's more, the stereo separation is now sharp enough to enhance the music in a serious way -- the divided string section in the \"Brandenburger\" section of \"Ars Longa Vita Brevis,\" for example, adds to the appeal of the band's playing in ways that were difficult to discern on earlier CD releases, as well as on most of the LP issues.</p><p>And the live cuts from the Fillmore East from the third album are now transcendent -- every note is right in your lap, from Brian Davison's rapid-fire drumming to Keith Emerson's dizzying keyboard flourishes, and the balance between Emerson's organ and Lee Jackson's bass on \"She Belongs to Me\" is finally set at a proper level on a CD, for the first time. Just as important as the research that went into locating the first-generation tapes is the producers' success in finding the group's complete alternate takes; every odd outtake that ever surfaced in the band's history is present on disc three of this set, along with a quartet of previously unreleased live tracks recorded in concert during 1968 and 1969, among them \"America,\" the fourth movement of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique symphony, and the Troika from Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé suite (which was later adapted by Emerson, Lake & Palmer into \"I Believe in Father Christmas\").

		"review": "<p>It's been weird the last couple of months, driving around the plywood-lined canyons of Hollywood&mdash;the endless construction zone, the castles of scaffolding and the drywall façades that mark the parking garages, the Scientology test centers, the mini-malls of tomorrow. Between rows of handbills for 8 Mile and Christina Aguilera's Stripped there are stark grids of them, white on black, with a single word: NIRVANA. And for a moment, it's as if nothing has changed in the ten years I've lived in Los Angeles. The payphones are still plastered with flyers beckoning models and movie extras, and you can still get a pretty decent slice of pie for six bucks. I'm still secretly infatuated with the oversized billboards that hawk made-for-cable movies down on the Sunset Strip, and I still think In 'n' Out Burgers are overrated. But somehow it's comforting to see the handbills&mdash;ghostly, surreal tombstones, reverent in their simplicity.</p><p>Had Kurt Cobain not shot himself in the face in April 1994, it's hard to say how different the world might be. The commercial explosion of alternative rock began with the four-chord blitzkrieg of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", decimating the glass ceiling that had taunted major-label hopefuls like R.E.M., The Flaming Lips, and The Pixies in the 80s. The majors responded by hiring battalions of silver-tongued A&R; reps to find a successor for the band, bloating their rosters with gimmicky wannabes and booking Butch Vig, Jack Endino, Steve Albini, Scott Litt and Brad Wood solid through 1998. While the feeding frenzy brought deserved attention to idiosyncratic bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, it ended with the \"alternative\" tag being co-opted by any and every new band, and soon the uniformly aggressive sounds of Bush, Live, and Silverchair ruled the airwaves. Kurt Cobain did not live to see this.</p><p>Nor did Cobain live to see the music-biz megamergers of the late 90s, which found a liquor empire acquiring venerable Hollywood labels like A&M;, Geffen, and DGC (Nirvana's label) and booting literally hundreds of bands&mdash;including Cobain's beloved Raincoats and Meat Puppets&mdash;from the majors. Surely Cobain would have reacted with abject disgust to the brazen payola which successfully poised Limp Bizkit as the new alt-rock prototype, or with disappointment as the old-school punk stylings of Green Day and The Offspring gave birth to the eerily homogenous, overcompressed frat-rock that currently dominates your friendly neighborhood Clear Channel or Infinity affiliate.</p><p>Likewise, Pitchfork was not around in 1991 to guardedly praise the slick, but undeniably classic Nevermind, to shake our heads in bafflement at the curiosity shop of Incesticide, or to hold lighters aloft at the majestic bombast of In Utero. Had Kurt Cobain lived to mark the ten-year anniversary of his biggest success in September 2001, he would have gotten his Leonard Cohen afterworld, and if it wasn't his weekend to keep Frances Bean he probably would have written a song about it. Perhaps he'd have recognized the budding songwriting chops of bandmate Dave Grohl and begun a songwriting collaboration/competition worthy of Lennon and McCartney, or taken a couple of years off before emerging with a brilliant, basement-recorded solo album (and a beard).</p><p>Instead, I find myself in the curious position of eulogizing Nirvana based on this fourteen-track best-of collection whose very existence is the result of a legal settlement. Exciting, huh? I think we can all agree that Sid & Nancy would've been a much more compelling story if, rather than Nancy Spungen dying in a Chelsea Hotel bathroom, she had survived Sid Vicious, kicked her habit, taken acting lessons, hired a phalanx of attorneys to force evil journalists and record companies to cease and desist their dastardly anti-Nancy conspiracies, and published Sid's private diaries for a $2 million payday. Long story short, Grohl and Krist Novoselic spent a year compiling an exhaustive box set with heaps of previously unreleased material, demo and rehearsal recordings, live gems, and the like; Courtney Love insisted on releasing this more conventional best-of first.</p><p>On the one hand, this radio-friendly unit shifter is indeed an artful selection of the band's most seminal material&mdash;four cuts each from Nevermind and In Utero, two from Incesticide and Unplugged in New York, and one from Bleach. Then, of course, there's the bait: the haunting, previously unreleased \"You Know You're Right\", recorded during Nirvana's last-ever studio session, and laced with tantalizingly literal expressions of the physical and mental pain that dominated the last months of Cobain's life.</p><p>On the other hand, the very existence of Nirvana is a cynical assessment of the current retail climate&mdash;a party mix for parents who want to appreciate Cobain's Lennon-esque knack for great melodies without having to click past \"Scentless Apprentice\" or \"Territorial Pissings\". With the possible exception of \"Rape Me\", Nirvana is utterly inoffensive: an impulse buy from Columbia House, perhaps, with no more artistic value than The Eagles' Greatest Hits or the Beatles' 1. If the kids want a righteous Nirvana mix, they'll burn one&mdash;let the yuppies pad Frances Bean's college fund with their filthy dotcom lucre.</p><p>Nirvana lies all of its cards on the table immediately with the familiar chugging rhythms of \"You Know You're Right\", Novoselic's bass menacing as Cobain rakes the strings above the bridge of his beloved Mustang for a dissonant, Thurston Moore-on-Zoloft effect. The song itself is something of a sketch: Kurt reportedly rewrote several lyrics just before the recording session and intentionally slurs where the words aren't quite there (er, \"Let's talk about someone else/ Steaming soup begins to melt\"?). \"You Know You're Right\" predictably hits all the familiar Nirvana marks, and pointed lines like, \"I will move away from here,\" and, \"Nothing really bothers her/ She just wants to love herself,\" seem aimed directly at Love, hinting that ragged dissections of marital discord might have dominated Nirvana's fourth album.</p><p>This is one of the most beguiling mysteries of Nirvana: how a thrift store-sweater-wearing kid from trailer-park Aberdeen went from the carefree jangle of \"About a Girl\" to the stormy malevolence of \"All Apologies\" (which pointedly rhymes \"married\" with \"buried\"; Cobain would be both shortly after writing it). \"About a Girl\" feigns nonchalance, but there are omens beneath the surface that would haunt much of Cobain's short life&mdash;the intrinsically unhealthy relationship that festers more out of apathy and convenience than genuine affection. \"I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry,\" Cobain sings with matter-of-factness.</p><p>In his liner notes for Nirvana, David Fricke notes that Cobain wrote \"About a Girl\" after an extended session listening to Meet the Beatles, and while the connection is not immediately apparent, the song does serve as a blueprint for some of Cobain's most tuneful later compositions. Built around a mostly two-chord groove, the song veers in unexpected directions for the power choruses, made all the more effective by Cobain's unique guitar tuning. It's curious, based on the clean guitars and tinny cymbals that dominate here, how Nirvana ever came to be identified with grunge, the genuinely dirty and moody sound more readily associated with contemporaries Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Tad than the punk-metal hybrid Nirvana favored.</p><p>This is followed by Incesticide's two most accessible cuts. \"Been a Son\", from 1989's Blew EP, sounds like a test run for Nevermind, all rigid harmonies and tight, churning guitar (interestingly, the version here restores 30 seconds of music inexplicably cut from the Incesticide mix, including Novoselic's bass solo). \"Sliver\", one of the few Nirvana songs to directly address biographical details from Cobain's childhood, turns a simple visit to grandma's into a traumatic episode of parental abandonment, confusion, and fear.</p><p>Next up are the quartet of selections from Nevermind, which rightfully explode from the mix just as \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"In Bloom\" seemed to slice through your Passat's shitty speakers on your way to high school. I still contend it's Grohl's punishing drum attack and not the famous four-chord riff that sells \"Teen Spirit\" (even Cobain admitted the song was a derivative pastiche of Boston's \"More Than a Feeling\" and The Pixies), though Andy Wallace's slick-as-Valvoline mix remains the gold standard of the soft verse/loud chorus dynamic. Likewise, \"Come as You Are\" gleans its hook directly from Novoselic's rubbery bassline slithering in and out of the mix with frightening stealth.</p><p>But \"Lithium\" and \"In Bloom\" are wholly Cobain's, with references tailor-made for the American everyteen: \"Today I've found my friends/ They're in my head\"; \"I'm so ugly, but that's okay 'cause so are you.\" Both knowingly turn the enthusiastic \"yeah yeah yeah's\" of the Beatles into snarling expressions of sarcasm&mdash;an allusion literalized in the \"In Bloom\" video, which pitched Nirvana as 60s idols with matching outfits on an Ed Sullivan-esque variety show (which in turn inspired the complete wardrobe of vintage Weezer). It's interesting how Nevermind, written and recorded well before the crest of sudden fame crushed Cobain's spirit, almost seems more jaded than its successor&mdash;\"Teen Spirit\" and \"In Bloom\" deriding fans as mindless drones that demand entertainment, yet \"don't know what it means.\"</p><p>By contrast, In Utero, which begins with the words, \"Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I'm bored and old,\" and ends with an apology, is full of curiously thoughtful retractions and carefully worded sentiments. The provocatively titled \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"Rape Me\" represent Cobain's sympathy for, and fascination with, the female of the species. I've always considered \"Heart-Shaped Box\", with its elliptical guitar figure and explosive choruses, to be one of Cobain's most accomplished compositions. For all its heavy-handed symbolism, the song strikes deepest to Cobain's preoccupation with birth, the menstrual cycle, and female anatomy, wound tightly with primal tension in the verses and released with sublime catharsis in the choruses.</p><p>But \"Rape Me\"&mdash;meant to be an anthem of empowerment from the perspective of the victim&mdash;comes off as a shallow and transparent attempt to court controversy. The four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" riff (Nirvana would often tease live audiences with a few licks from \"Teen Spirit\" before launching into its intellectually stunted first cousin). The seemingly tacked-on bridge (\"My favorite inside source/ I'll kiss your open sores\") is one of Cobain's most awkward, and I think most of us could have done without the distressed round-robin choruses of \"Rape me! Rape me!\" that close the song.</p><p>\"Pennyroyal Tea\" is presented here in a \"previously unreleased\" alternate mix (actually, it's widely available on the 'clean' version of In Utero) that basically nudges the guitars and Cobain's harmony vocals up ever so slightly. The mix was prepared by Scott Litt for a single withdrawn after Cobain's suicide (the single included \"I Hate Myself and Want to Die\" as a b-side). Cobain's fascination with female bodily processes continues (pennyroyal tea was famously used to induce abortion in colonial America) as he enumerates remedies he's tried to relieve his own pain&mdash;warm milk and laxatives, but not heroin.</p><p>\"Dumb\" is one of Cobain's most underrated efforts, a populist revision of \"Lithium\" that replaces Nevermind's misanthropy with earnest self-deprecation. With a jaunty guitar hook that rivals \"Polly\" or \"About a Girl\", \"Dumb\" finds Cobain not sneering at his fans with distaste, but pining for the simple pleasures of wasting time and taking drugs (well, sniffing glue) with his friends. Kera Schaley's cello is \"Dumb\"'s secret weapon, overshadowing Novoselic's simple bassline and lending the bridge (hands down, Cobain's best) a transcendent country-rock lilt: \"Skin the sun, fall asleep/ Wish away, the soul is cheap/ Lesson learned, wish me luck/ Soothe the burn, wake me up.\" The emphatic harmonies in the final refrains (\"I think I'm DUMB, I think I'm DUMB...\") are among Cobain's most vulnerable, successfully conveying a deep longing in a way that the overambitious \"Pennyroyal Tea\" and \"Rape Me\" miss completely.</p><p>Nirvana closes with two cuts from Unplugged in New York: a low-key reading of In Utero's somber \"All Apologies\" and an inspired cover of David Bowie's \"The Man Who Sold the World\". Keen selections, but unfortunately the loss of fidelity between the crystalline studio recordings and a live performance that was only supposed to sound good on TV gives this collection a distinctly incomplete feeling.</p><p>So do I give Nirvana a 10.0 for the unimpeachable quality of the material, or a 2.0 for the crass cynicism for which it's exploited? I mean, this collection is by no means essential&mdash;Nevermind and In Utero are. I almost wish that the release of Nirvana had been postponed another year so that Courtney Love could have seen Matador's illuminating and respectful double-disc packaging of Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted, which offers the original album, an entire live show, two Peel sessions, three singles, and previously unreleased material&mdash;all for the same suggested retail price as Nirvana. The packaging includes hand-scribbled pages from Stephen Malkmus' notebooks (but not his whole goddamn diary) and liner notes written by band members and people who were actually there&mdash;not just some rockcrit eager to unpack his adjectives. It's probably the best reissue of any album I've ever seen, and not just because it's an indie rock classic, but because it's assembled with such selfless affection.</p><p>By comparison, Nirvana feels like a rush job&mdash;reverent to the memory of Kurt Cobain, but disrespectful, even patronizing, of his infinitely patient fans. It would have been fantastic, for instance, to finally hear the original Steve Albini mixes of \"All Apologies\" and \"Heart-Shaped Box\", or favorites like \"Sappy\" (a huge radio hit here in southern California) and \"Spank Thru\" placed in the greater context of Nirvana's better-known repertoire. Dozens of illuminating b-sides and compilation tracks (everything from covers of the Velvet Underground and the Wipers to a full-band reading of Grohl's excellent \"Marigold\") are conspicuously absent here, doubtlessly because the publishing royalties don't go to Love. But at least the floodgates are open, with both a rarities collection, and yes, that box set finally in the pipeline.</p><p>Since words are cheap, though (and Cobain's diaries are only $20.97 over at Amazon), I'll leave you with a quote from Cobain himself, quoted by Fricke in defense of this album's crassness: \"All the albums I ever liked were albums that delivered a great song, one after the other.\" Hey, I like albums like that, too, Kurt. It's just that records like Nirvana, with its 24-bit remastering job to smooth the transitions between drummers and producers, deprive the listener of the very thing they should be generously supplying: context. And while Nirvana does indeed look and sound great, honoring Cobain's legacy with all the peace, love, and empathy you can eat, I'll always listen to the original albums instead.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Will Bryant, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Cockburn himself has had jazz composition training and many of his songs have jazz textures and complex arrangements. This lays a firm groundwork for Occhipinti's instrumental interpretations and the resulting album is a successful combination of faithfulness to the original works and experimentation. Arranged for a core trio of guitar, bass, and drums with guests, Cockburn's songs are re-created and reborn without losing the spirit of the piece. It doesn't hurt that Hugh Marsh and Jon Goldsmith, who have played on many Cockburn tours and recordings, are featured on the album (in fact, Goldsmith is the producer) and that Cockburn himself makes an appearance. From the wild and chaotic take on the title song to the moody \"Live on My Mind,\" Creation Dream is an album worth seeking out by any fan of jazz, Occhipinti, or Cockburn.</P>— <B>Rob Caldwell</B>"

Souther, Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits, and Jennifer Warnes. Backed by Elvis' touring band from the late '60s and '70s, this all-star lineup shines on Orbison classics ranging from rockers like \"Ooby Dooby,\" \"Oh, Pretty Woman,\" and \"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\" to yearning ballads like \"In Dreams,\" \"Crying,\" and \"It's Over.\" Though some DVD extras like a biography or discography would have been nice, Roy Orbison: Black &amp; White Night will delight Orbison fans with its well-chosen setlist, refined production values, and strong performances.</p><p>—  <b>Heather Phares</b></p>"

Sounding like the bastard offspring of Mick Jagger and Van Morrison, Parker sneers his way through a set of stunningly literate pub rockers. Instead of blindly sticking to the traditions of rock & roll, Parker invigorates them with cynicism and anger, turning his songs into distinctively original works. \"Back to Schooldays\" may be reconstituted rockabilly, \"White Honey\" may recall Morrison's white R&B bounce, and \"Howlin' Wind\" is a cross of Van's more mystical moments and the Band, but the songs themselves are original and terrific. Similarly, producer Nick Lowe gives the album a tough, spare feeling, which makes Parker and the Rumour sound like one of the best bar bands you've ever heard. Howlin' Wind remains a thoroughly invigorating fusion of rock tradition, singer/songwriter skill, and punk spirit, making it one of the classic debuts of all time.</p><p><b>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

Most observers, including Parker himself, blamed his U.S. label, Mercury Records, for failing to give him the promotion he needed Stateside; eager to find a more suitable corporate partner, Parker opted to finish off his contract with Mercury via that time-honored form of contractual obligation filler, the double-live album. In many respects, The Parkerilla practically screams \"Let's get this over with,\" from the skimpy running time (54 minutes, including a studio re-recording of \"Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions\" that filled side four) and unimaginative set list, to a slightly dodgy mix that keeps losing track of the horn section, and a sequence that has a hard time keeping one of the most exciting acts of the day in forward gear. However, Parker and the Rumour were too good on-stage for The Parkerilla to feel entirely like a throwaway; Parker's vocals are tough and soulful at every turn, the Rumour get more of a chance to show off their instrumental prowess here than they did on their studio recordings, and when the players connect with the right song, as they do on \"Back to Schooldays,\" \"Soul Shoes,\" and \"Gypsy Blood,\" it's hard not to wish this hadn't been such an obvious rush job, since the potential for a great concert set was clearly there. (The live take of \"Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions\" is also superb, and makes mincemeat of the silly disco-influenced studio recut that closes out the album.) The Parkerilla has a reputation as a tossed-off disaster, and while it's a lot better than that, you don't have to know the back story to hear a band biding their time until something better comes along on this set.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>While it was something short of a hit, Squeezing Out Sparks did win a measure of richly deserved American recognition for Graham Parker & the Rumour, and for the follow-up, Parker's American record label, Arista, paired him up with hotshot producer Jimmy Iovine. The idea looked good on paper; Iovine had produced or engineered great sounding hard rock records for Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Patti Smith, and his tough but vibrant sound would seem the perfect match for Parker and his band. But one listen to The Up Escalator reveals that Iovine's trademark sound somehow escaped him for this project; the recording and mix are flat and poorly detailed (Brinsley Schwarz's lead guitar and Stephen Goulding's drums suffer the most), and the often mushy audio manages the remarkable feat of making the Rumour, one of the most exciting rock bands of their day, sound just a bit dull. But Parker fights the muddy sound every step of the way, and if his batting average as a songwriter is a shade lower than on Squeezing Out Sparks, he certainly offers up his share of A-list material, including the incendiary \"Empty Lives,\" the passionate \"The Beating of Another Heart,\" and \"Endless Night,\" which features one Bruce Springsteen on backing vocals. Parker's singing is sharp and commanding, and even though the mix lets them down, the Rumour's performances are tough and precise throughout. The Up Escalator failed to catch the ears of the mass audience, and Parker would soon part ways with the Rumour, but if this album doesn't present them in the best light, it shows that they could play tough, passionate rock & roll that could survive even the most adverse recording conditions.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>When Graham Parker issued the Jack Nitzsche-produced Squeezing out Sparks in 1979, many inside the music industry -- from execs to critics -- figured that his next one would be it, since Squeezing just missed, though it was celebrated by nearly everyone who heard it. Two of Parker's first three albums -- Howlin' Wind and Heat Treatment -- were top-notch, hard hitting rock & roll albums full of great songs and mud-slinging pub rock production that connected in England. It felt like only a matter of time. Arista in its infinite wisdom paired Parker with Jimmy Iovine for The Up Escalator in 1980, and for some reason, Iovine decided to slicken up the singer/songwriter and his band rather than the hard-edged production that clicked when he worked with Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty. While the songs were there, the sound wasn't, and it must have been discouraging for Parker. His moment had come and gone. Parker wasn't about to let fate cheat him, though, and for 1982's Another Grey Area, he teamed with veteran producer Jack Douglas, and placed his band on recording hiatus in favor of a slew of studio musicians including Nicky Hopkins, Hugh McCracken (!), David Brown and George Small among others. Things start well enough with the mid-tempo rocker \"Temporary Beauty\"; with its Springsteen-esque piano and ondioline courtesy of Hopkins, the rounded lead guitar lines fall into place, wrapping themselves around Parker's voice on the refrains, and it works. Parker nearly spits out his words, full of irony, empathy, piss and vinegar. They even hold up on the title track, which cooks along with a bitter edge, a brisk tempo set by a snare/hi-hat combination and six strings upfront pushing the singer. Female backing vocals to fill it in and the bassline nearly percolates. But Douglas' production begins to wear thin by \"Big Fat Zero,\" despite Parker's fine writing. He doesn't seem to be able to capture the knife edge the band tries to counter the vocals with. It's all swirl and twirl without resolution or warmth. Ironically, it's the rawness on Parker's earlier records that made them warm. The reliance on \"new wave\" sounding electric keyboards also mars the tunes. The ballad \"Dark Side of the Bright Lights,\" works well, as does the horn-driven, funky \"You Hit the Spot.\" But the sameness of some of the rockers such as \"Can't Waste a Minute\" and the poignant \"Crying for Attention\" suffer. \"It's All Worth Nothing Alone\" is punched up a bit, but there still seems to be this glassfloor sheen on everything, which is entirely at odds with the biting humor and scathing social observations Parker makes in both his lyrics and his delivery. Ultimately, Another Grey Area is another \"might have been if\" set for Parker, and about the last time he believed a word of what anyone from a record company ever said to him.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>There's a wonderful, solitary beauty to the performance captured on this CD, from Philadelphia's Theatre of Living Arts in October of 1988. True, Parker doesn't do any radical re-tooling of any of his repertory in the manner of, say, Bob Dylan. But he does give us a lot of that repertory, going back more than a decade to Howlin' Wind, and into some unexpected corners of his work; fans may quibble about the choices, but taken on its own terms, what's here is delightful. The combination of his voice and a solo acoustic guitar, plus a relaxed venue and an obviously appreciative crowd, seem to have yielded a perfect vibe for the duration of the show. What's more, stripping Parker's songs to their basics is a good idea, lending them a folk-like spontaneity and intimacy that gives the words more meaning and the music more of a pronounced (yet still understated) beauty. Even \"Three Martini Lunch\" achieves a quiet, rootsy splendor and honesty. And Parker's voice rises to the occasion, with an elegant expressiveness that's much more (if not impossible) difficult to achieve in an amplified setting. Strangely enough, \"Back in Time,\" the one song from Mona Lisa's Sister, his most recent studio album at the time, sounds slick and commercial next to the older repertory, though it's still fine listening, and might have made a great single in this form. And then there are the audience participation, clap-along numbers, such as \"Hotel Chambermaid\" and \"Don't Let It Bring You Down,\" which can make the listener wish there'd been a video account of this show as well; even non-fans can float away on the ebullience of moments like these. And Parker closes the show with an artistically very risky move: white artists have been covering Sam Cooke songs for decades (Parker did it with \"Cupid\" on Mona Lisa's Sister); but \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" isn't just any Sam Cooke, or any song, trading as it does in images of racism, grief, and longing. Parker does pull it off, just. Southside Johnny is still the white artist best-suited to do that song, if anyone is, but Parker's restrained playing and raw emoting get him by, to a satisfying final.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In the year before his death in the fall of 1973, Gram Parsons recorded two superb solo albums, and Warner Brothers has conveniently reissued them in their entirety on a single compact disc. Since many of the same musicians played on both G.P. (released in January of 1973) and Grievous Angel (which appeared in stores almost exactly a year later), the two albums flow together quite well as a single set. And while no bonus tracks were added, the booklet features well-written essays on Parsons from John M. Delgatto and Marley Brant, the complete liner notes from both albums, and lyrics for all the songs on the disc (which weren't included in the original vinyl issues). While the material and performances on G.P. are a shade stronger than on Grievous Angel, both albums have more than their share of pearly moments, and this disc is a treat from start to finish; James Burton's guitar leads are chicken-pickin' at its smartest and most tasteful, Al Perkins' pedal steel is the definitive sound of country & western heartache, fiddler Byron Berline effortlessly reveals how he became one of Nashville's leading session musicians, and Parsons' duets with the young Emmylou Harris are nothing less than sublime. And would anyone who loves either country or rock really want to be without a CD that includes songs like \"A Song for You,\" \"The New Soft Shoe,\" \"Big Mouth Blues,\" \"$1,000 Wedding,\" or \"In My Hour of Darkness\"? While the definitive Gram Parsons collection has yet to be compiled, G.P./Grievous Angel gives you everything you really need from his solo career, and these 20 performances are among the most influential and satisfying music the genre of country-rock would ever produce.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Mark Deming</strong</p>"

Patton's 78s have been collected in several fine packages, including the JSP box called Complete Recordings, Catfish's three-disc budget box called Definitive Charley Patton, and the last word in all this, the impressive (and expensive) seven-disc Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues from Revenant Records. This single-disc selection from Proper works as an inexpensive single-disc introduction to Patton, and it contains his best-known songs like \"Pony Blues,\" the two-part \"High Water Everywhere,\" \"Down the Dirt Road Blues,\" \"High Sheriff Blues,\" and \"Revenue Man Blues.\" Since Patton's rhythms and overall approach can be repetitive at times, casual listeners wondering what all the fuss is about might be better served with a single disc like this one that hones things down a bit, but Patton's work is both the Big Bang and the epicenter of country blues, so going a little deeper and springing for one of the box sets is well worth the time and expense.</P><p>&mdash; <b>Steve Leggett</b></p>"

And as it is only slightly less thorough -- the Document discs include extra takes on \"Elder Green Blues,\" \"Hammer Blues,\" and \"Some of these Days I'll Be Gone\" -- this compilation seems the likely choice for anyone with an interest in pre-war Delta blues. Both affordable and handsomely packaged, the three-disc box includes extensive liner notes written by blues historians Keith Briggs and Alex Van Der Tuuk, with reminiscences by Patton crony Son House.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Travis Drageset</strong></p><hr/><p>The late 1800’s/early 1900’s, the term “redneck” had drastically different connotation than that which it carries today. Initially it was a verbal short hand to describe the Irish and Scottish immigrant farmers down south. After a day in the fields their necks burnt a lobster red. Like all who joined the great melting pot with dreams and hopes of something better, they brought their songs to sing with them. Folk melodies, murder ballads, played with a lot of the instruments which would be used for the early country music. This mixed with the sung laments of plantation slaves birthed the blues.</p><p>The earliest blues was a complex amalgam of these three seemingly divergent sources, country, folk and plain song brought over by the slaves. In the far future practitioners may have more chops, but the construction and influences would never again be as open minded, nor as organically mixed.</p><p>The embodiment of this first great wave of bluesmen was Charlie Patton. The exact date of his birth is often debated. Given sometimes as April 1887 or 1891. He himself was never sure, the later date being supplied by his parents for a 1900 census poll. He could not read or write except his name which he always slowly spelled out loud C-h-a-r-l-i-e. Ironically throughout his oeuvre it is spelled Charley.</p><p>Charlie was descended of mixed blood which included white, Native American and African American. The oddly pejorative term “good hair” (Caucasian-like) was often used to describe him when not talking about his music.</p><p>His family was religious and disapproved of his music and his casual teachers. The music was referred to as “Devil’s music” and his romance with it often earned him beatings from his father. Eventually, for whatever reason his father eased up, even buying Charlie a guitar. It was shortly after this he hit the road never again to return home for any real length of time.</p><p>Charlie’s main recorded output was the blues, but this was far more a financial decision on the part of the record company than a personal artistic choice on Charlie’s part. It was the same commercial consideration which largely kept Charlie’s less blues like pieces from ever seeing wax.</p><p>He did not seem to mind. Often to give an audience their money’s worth, when performing Charlie would toss and catch his guitar, play the underside percussively, drum like or when the mood struck him, behind his head. Considering what was resonating from him, all far from necessary.</p><p>Although he never liked to complain, like many artists of his day (and sadly, in ensuing decades) Charlie was taken advantage of by record companies. He and other artists would have to commute to Northern cities to record or in makeshift studios set up in barns or flop houses.</p><p>These early blues men were pursued by record companies not out respect for their artistic merits but in hope of creating an African American record buying (phonographs too) public. With few exceptions this was driving vision behind these small companies.</p><p>Pony Blues was successful, Charlie’s biggest seller (Paramount Records). In keeping with the times only the smallest trickle of money went to him. From his point of view, while never becoming rich, he was kept in sandwiches, whiskey and smokes. Always happy enough to not have to do manual labor as often.</p><p>Pea Vine Blues used a new gimmick thought up by the record company. The record was released with a contest. The singer was listed as “The Masked Marvel” its cover depicting an illustration which looked like Charlie donning a Lone Ranger styled mask. Contestants were asked to guess his identity. The winner received a Paramount Record of their choice. The contest entry forms accompanied the record all 10,000 sold out. Staggering when you consider that this was well before the age of mass media or quick communication. Paramount Records hedged their bets by also doing up 7000 promo posters and ads in The Chicago Defender, the premier paper for the other side of segregated America.</p><p>The initial pressing quickly sold out creating the market for a second pressing, a then rarity for such a specialized market.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Charlie had recorded (briefly) some religious hymns under the pseudonym J.J Hadley. Either name was an accepted answer for the contest.</p><p>Charlie was of average height and slight build (135lbs) but some of his material was musical boasts concerning his prowess and potency. (Charlie as a proto rapper?). Mostly though, he and other blues forefathers would recite topical verse over often simple but hypnotic beats. Charlie is believed to be the first one to use the now standard twelve bar blues pattern.</p><p>Initially, before the lexicon of blues standards was born, the tales in Charlie and his peers songs were intricate, image rich American Gothic. Flannery O’Connor meets the juke joint.</p><p>In Charlie’s lyrics, depending upon your point of view, God or the devil was ever present, not as an incarnation, but as natural calamities. Floods, the taste of one’s mortality, even boweevils. Despite the commercial considerations of what Charlie recorded, there was always more than just some woman having done him wrong. Deeper themes whose narrative complexity still retain their power in this modern age when Charlie’s way of life has long since vanished.</p><p>Another key appeal of Charlie’s work was his vocals. The lyrics were often obscured. The cadence of his voice being used as a second instrument. There is something about the sound of those simple, yet hypnotic beats mixing with that voice. It reaches deep down into you, a primal twitch. I like to listen to this in the dark. You should listen to this in the dark, listen anywhere desolation and appetite can be poetry.</p><p>It was said that Charlie had, had eight wives. At the very least he had eight roommates. With a hair trigger temper he had fought with all of them.</p><p>When not in jail, sick or recording, this American troubadour was out living the life he would represent in his art. Reporting on what he saw and interjecting his own opinions. One of the strongest tracks off of CD #2 is “High Water Everywhere”. This was based off of the 1927 Mississippi flood and its after effects as he witnessed them. It is from the episodic growl as much as the cabaret theater world of Brecht/Weil that Tom Waits would build his initial musical foundation  off of.</p><p>Long time brother in arms Willie Brown spent years observing and playing with Charlie. From the practical application of this apprenticeship Willie became a great blues man in his own right. It was from Willie in the 1920’s a teenage Robert Johnson attempted to learn.</p><p>With the onslaught of the depression, many small record labels folded, times were tough all around and Charlie made due the best he could. By the mid 1930’s, Charlie, in his mid forties began to feel the effects of his lifestyle. A fight one night ended with Charlie having his throat slit and living to sing about it. Bad woman, good cocaine and strong whiskey with an endless supply of cigarettes to mark the time in between each.</p><p>1934 saw the depression finally beginning to bottom out. People no longer needed to be tunnel-visioned on how to eat, where to find work. It would be several more years until it was done with completely. The theory that affordable distractions will always make money in times of trouble has been proven again and again.</p><p>W.R Calaway of The American Record Corporation wanted to record Charlie. For what would be Charlie’s last sessions he tracked the artist and his wife Bertha Lee who would share vocal duties, down to a Mississippi jail where they were both serving time for having had one of their knock down drag outs at a house party. W.R Calaway made bail and brought the pair to New York.</p><p>New York was having one of its bad winters. Charlie was already frail and sick. Both in lyrical content and in his haunted performance Charlie seems to have felt the ebb and flow of his mortality.</p><p>One of Charlie’s last recorded songs was 34 Blues, 34 being slang for “go away”. Three months after his final sessions while living on a plantation with another woman Charlie died of a heart condition brought on by an attack of rheumatic fever. As he lay dying, in delirium, it was to the reciting of one of the religious hymns he recorded as J.J Hadley he occupied his last days until death finally took him.</p><p>The sound on these three CDs is good, it has been cleaned up, but not sanitized to the point of loosing its soul in studio artificiality. At times there is the ambient presence of a 78’s hiss. It works, it belongs. The effect is akin to listening to some of the great prewar Edith Piaf recordings which contain the same hiss. It furthers the effect of being spoken to from another time, without ever distracting or lessening the art. So well does it work, it almost seems as if these two artists, so different, both incorporate the hiss and technological limitations into their deliveries and technique.</p><p>The songs are all presented in chronological order which I always think is a nice touch. Aside from the aforementioned “High Water Everywhere” another personal favorite (CD #2) is “Mean Black Moan” which features a trance inducing guitar pattern, with the singing violin sounding almost like an upper register clarinet all occurring while the tale is told.</p><p>Henry Sims on violin is perfect. He had a touch which managed to be both raw and subtle. He would go on to work with later day blues man Muddy Waters. It offers a glimpse of what might have been if Charlie had had opportunity for more instrumentation or at least further sympathetic accompaniment.</p><p>The packaging is nice. The three CDs are packaged in hard cardboard sleeves to look like old  78’s which are housed in a good looking little box with an eighteen page informative booklet.</p><p>This compares nicely with “The Best of Charlie Patton” (1 CD Yazoo). Yazoo was one of foremost revivalist of early American music chroniclers. This is one CD and not really that much less than this three CD set.</p><p>The crown jewel for any serious collector is “Screamin’ and Hollerin’ the Blues:The Worlds of Charley Patton” (7 CDs Revenant Records) This is literally functional art. Designed to look like a large 78’s record box, it includes lots of reading material including the long out of print thesis on Charlie by John Fahey, stickers interviews and other Charlie related literature. An investment to be sure, but worth it.</p><p>It was not until 1980 Charlie was actually induced into The Blues Foundation’s hall of fame. In 1990 singer John Fogerty paid for a proper funerary monument to be erected. Other Mississippi blues men are talked about and sited more often. Charlie’s stuff, because of its deeply personal delivery would be far harder to emulate. This is the king. From the roots of this musical tree would flow far reaching and diverse branches.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Maxwell Chandler</strong></p>"

Against the odds&mdash;as well as against the band's wishes, apparently&mdash;their debut became a phenomenon, an alt-rock figurehead as crucial as Nevermind in ushering in and defining the parameters for mainstream rock. Vedder's self-doubts ran as deep as Cobain's, but he expressed them bluntly and directly rather than poetically and obscurely. Oh and also, he's still alive.</p><p>Deeply invested in the cathartic possibilities of punk and classic rock, Pearl Jam seemingly made music as a form of self-therapy, an idea that took hold with nearly a decade of alt-rock acts to come. The band is routinely blamed for the self-gratifying Stone Temple Pilots, Creeds, and Nicklebacks that followed Ten, but the band naturally never set out to remake rock music in its own image. Suspicious of the hedonism of the arena rock that preceded them, Pearl Jam were a solemn band, and Ten sounds nothing if not entirely serious about animating Vedder's self-doubts. At times, it's a bit overwrought (\"I don't question our existence/ I just question our modern needs\"), but the earnestness with which Vedder sang and the band played these songs belies the decade's reputation as a period of pervasive irony. Ultimately, the 1990s wouldn't have been so bad if Pearl Jam's followers hadn't aped their self-seriousness so relentlessly.</p><p>Nevertheless, Ten remains impressive and occasionally moving 18 years later, even gentrified with a shiny reissue. The public perception of the album is watered down thanks mainly to the excision of \"Alive\", \"Jeremy\", and \"Even Flow\" as singles. The latter two may be the album's least remarkable tracks: \"Jeremy\" is the most pat Freudian psychodrama on an album full of them, and \"Evenflow\" romanticizes homelessness as spiritually transcendent. But \"Alive\" remains potent not only because Vedder touches on some seriously transgressive shit here (dead fathers, hints at incest, survivor guilt), but mostly because the band rock the hell out of that coda.</p><p>Today, Ten lives and dies by its album tracks, and while there are a few clunkers, most are pretty ballsy in their disdain for expectations. Granted, as a new band with few realistic prospects for the kind of success they quickly achieved, Pearl Jam were working with a very different set of expectations than the ones retroactively assigned to them. On songs like \"Once\", with its insistent breakdowns, and \"Black\", with strangely dramatic vocalizations, there's a hardscrabble dynamic that the band would be unable to capture on subsequent releases. \"Why Go\" is ferocious in its outrage, with Vedder delivering his most pained vocals, and Stone Gossard and Mike McCready match him on every song, translating Vedder's howls into messy, edge-of-the-precipice solos and paint-peeling riffs like the one that anchors \"Deep\".</p><p>In addition to the original album as produced by Rick Parashar and mixed by Tim Palmer, the new reissue includes a second disc, titled Ten Redux, that includes a new mix by Brendan O'Brien. A few of these new versions appeared on 2004's best-of Rearviewmirror, and O'Brien, who has worked with Pearl Jam on most of their subsequent albums, brings Vedder's ad libs to the forefront, sharpens some of the guitar riffs, and generally cleans up the murkiness. Sounding like 2005 rather than 1991, Ten Redux misses the point: The album's murkiness was one of its chief attractions, its flawed spontaneity feeding the songs' of-the-moment intensity. Ultimately, these new versions have less to do with Pearl Jam's music than with O'Brien's superfandom.</p><p>Ten Redux closes with a paltry six bonus tracks. \"2,000 Mile Blues\" is atrocious Jimi worship, \"Evil Little Goat\" is Vedder's best Jim Morrison impersonation, and neither \"Breath\" (here retitled \"Breath and a Scream\") nor \"State of Love and Trust\" sound as vital here as they did on the Singles soundtrack. These tracks are obviously intended not to overlap with 2003's Lost Dogs: Rarities and B-Sides, but flipsides like \"Dirty Frank\" and \"Yellow Ledbetter\" were surprisingly popular satellites orbiting Ten, played often on radio stations that didn't typically delve that deep into any artist's catalog and shouted at concerts by fans who weren't that fanatic. Their absence limits the reissue, creating an incomplete portrait of the band in its earliest days.</p><p>Ten deserved better than Ten Redux and the paltry bonus tracks. Fortunately, the reissue also includes a DVD of Pearl Jam's 1992 performance on \"MTV Unplugged\". The fashions are of course dated (nice fuzzy hat, Jeff Ament) and Vedder's stool-bound intensity can be fairly ridiculous, but the DVD is a useful and entertaining document of their intense live sets. Thanks to the tight rhythms of drummer Dave Abbruzzese and bass player Ament, the songs lose little of their momentum in this setting, which handily showcases the guitar interplay between Gossard and McCready. But this is Vedder's show&mdash;a live, public debut for his idiosyncrasies. Taking the stage in a tight jacket and backwards baseball cap, he gradually unleashes himself during the show, first letting his hair down and then eventually losing the jacket. By show's end, he's balancing precariously on his stool and scrawling PRO CHOICE!!! on his arms with a Sharpie. Pearl Jam may have shunned the spotlight, but they were born showmen.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Death and despair shroud the album, rendering even the explosive celebration of vinyl \"Spin the Black Circle\" somewhat muted. But that black cloud works to Pearl Jam's advantage, injecting a nervous tension to brittle rockers like \"Last Exit\" and \"Not for You,\" and especially introspective ballads like \"Corduroy\" and \"Better Man.\" In between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music — the mantrafunk of \"Aye Davanita,\" the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of \"Bugs,\" and the chilling sonic collage \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me.\" Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons.</p><p><b>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>A strange phenomenon with anthemic hard rock bands is that when they begin to mature and branch out into new musical genres, they nearly always choose to embrace both the music and spirituality of the East and India, and Pearl Jam is no exception. Throughout No Code, Eddie Vedder expounds on his moral and spiritual dilemmas; where on previous albums his rage was virtually all-consuming, it is clear on No Code that he has embraced an unspecified religion as a way to ease his troubles. Fortunately, that has coincided with an expansion of the group's musical palette. From the subtle, winding opener, \"Sometimes,\" and the near-prayer of the single, \"Who You Are,\" the band reaches into new territory, working with droning, mantra-like riffs and vocals, layered exotic percussion, and a newfound subtlety. Of course, they haven't left behind hard rock, but like any Pearl Jam record, the heart of No Code doesn't lie in the harder songs, it lies in the slower numbers and the ballads, which give Vedder the best platform for his soul-searching: \"Present Tense,\" \"Off He Goes,\" \"In My Tree,\" and \"Around the Bend\" equal the group's earlier masterpieces. While a bit too incoherent, No Code is Pearl Jam's richest and most rewarding album to date as well as their most human. They might be maturing in a fairly conventional method, but they still find new ways to state old truths.</p><p><b>&mdash; Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>Joe Strummer once claimed that the Clash had stardom in their hands, then they dropped it on the floor and broke it. Pearl Jam took the opposite tact: they purposely left stardom behind. Nirvana may have ushered in the age of grunge and alternative rock, but Pearl Jam were the biggest band in the land during the first half of the '90s, dominating radio airwaves, MTV, and college dorms alike. Most bands would have embraced such widespread acclaim, but the quintet bristled at this vein, and started to restlessly explore new musical territory, a move that eventually whittled their fan base down to just the hardcore by the beginning of the next decade. That hardcore following was still large, and the band could still have the occasional surprising crossover hit, like the 1999 cover of J. Frank Wilson's teen tragedy classic \"Last Kiss\" that went to number two on the Billboard charts, but they were no longer the biggest band in the land.</p><p>Spanning two discs, <i>Rearviewmirror</i> (Greatest Hits 1991-2003) chronicles that journey and it does an expert job not only of capturing the moment when Pearl Jam were monstrously popular, but proving that they still turned out good music even when they were fading from the spotlight. Unlike most career-spanning, multi-disc retrospectives, <i>Rearviewmirror</i> does not emphasize latter-day albums in order to achieve a sense of balance that's inherently phony. Of the 33 tracks, only 12 date from the post-<i>Vitalogy</i> era, which means that the bulk of the collection concentrates on their early-'90s heyday, and nearly every radio hit and concert staple is here, outside of the Victoria Williams cover \"Crazy Mary\" and \"Tremor Christ.\" While their presence would have been nice, they're not terribly missed, partially because such non-LP cuts like \"State of Love and Trust,\" \"I Got ID,\" \"Last Kiss,\" and \"Man of the Hour\" are collected here, but mainly because the compilation plays so well.</p><p>The songs are divided into the \"Up Side\" and \"Down Side,\" meaning the first disc has all the rockers and the second disc has all the ballads. At first, this seems like a questionable strategy, since it's usually preferable to have all the hits follow in chronological order, but what makes this work is that the songs on each disc are presented in chronological order, and they sustain their mood quite well (this is partially helped by Brendan O'Brien's new mixes of \"Once,\" \"Alive,\" and \"Black,\" which retain the feeling of the original songs but remove much of the dated glossy sheen in the production). Distilled to their hits and anthems, all of Pearl Jam's best qualities shine through and they sound bigger, better, and frankly more coherent than they do on their full-length albums. And that's why <i>Rearviewmirror</i> is a cut above most '90s hits collections: it not only gives casual fans all the hits, but it captures why the band mattered, while providing a better listen than their proper LPs in the process.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><p>As many others have done this year, the other night I went to see the Pixies' reunion tour. Next week, the Nirvana box set is finally released, as is a new two-disc expanded version of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral; Low's upcoming Sub Pop record kicks off with a track whose rhythm section and vocal melody sound like a miniature version of Alice in Chains; Q magazine named The Red Hot Chili Peppers the Best Act in the World Today at its 2004 awards show; TV commercials for Green Day's American Idiot reminds us that 10 years ago they released Dookie; and now Pearl Jam are lionized with the two-disc, 33-track, best-of album, Rearviewmirror. I'd be frightened that we're about to undergo a full-blown 90s alternarock revival&mdash;an era depressingly and backhandedly praised as much for what it was not (e.g. the hair metal that it \"kicked out,\" or the nu-metal that some of it slowly morphed into) than the music it produced. But then, it never went away, did it?</p><p>In recent years, Billy Corgan's Zwan, a reunited Jane's Addiction, the Scott Weiland-fronted Velvet Revolver, and the Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine mashup Audioslave have released records to varying degrees of commercial success. Prior to that, the nascent sounds of grunge remained among the dominant North American hard rock templates throughout the 90s and into this decade, living on in a lineage that extended from its Seattle roots through Bush and Candlebox to Creed and Nickleback.</p><p>Oddly, Pearl Jam have remained a constant since the days when 120 Minutes graduated to Alternative Nation, transitioning from stadium fillers to one of American rock's largest and most beloved cult bands, a Grateful Dead for the great washed. After deftly turning their backs on fame just as much of the public seemed poised to turn on them, Pearl Jam cultivated the unwavering support of a cabal of devotees who followed the band across a string of studio albums that casual observers have likely forgotten&mdash;No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act&mdash;and the almost comical release of every live show from their 2000 tour, a move that, depending on your level of cynicism, was either a thank you or an unintentional fuck you to their lemmingesque fanbase. Musically, Pearl Jam slightly spiced up their sound over the course of a decade, adding a few Eastern-tinged delicacies and some garage-rock snackfood to their typical meat-and-potatoes diet. By the time Creed became a permanent fixture on late-90s rock radio, the Florida band sounded as much like Pearl Jam as, well, Pearl Jam themselves.</p><p>Rearviewmirror divides the band's career into an \"up side\" and a \"down side\"&mdash;the former are the earnest rockers, the latter are the earnest ballads&mdash;although the monikers would also have been appropriate had they arranged the record chronologically. The \"down side\" to Pearl Jam's career allowed many people to romanticize the group's shift away from the spotlight as one purely of choice, and the band has since been characterized by honesty, good intentions, and yeoman's work, the sort of qualities that often make for turgid, sometimes rote, faceless music.</p><p>In truth, Pearl Jam were always planted squarely in the middle of the road. While Nirvana was characterized by punk's sound as much as its ethos, Soundgarden had one foot in contemporary metal, Smashing Pumpkins mixed 80s goth and new wave in with their glam, and Green Day, NIN, and the RHCP were clearly creatures of the post-punk era, Pearl Jam was always a classic rock band, the one alt-nation superstar that completely ignored both punk and its aftermath. Pearl Jam were all solos and riffs and lighters-aloft, arena-rock sentiment; like so many 60s rockers, they looked to the Asian sub-continent for their first flirtations with \"growth\" and \"maturity\"; they even cuddled up to the \"right\" rock 'n' roll architects (Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Neil Young). To claim Pearl Jam as the greatest rock band of our time&mdash;as many listeners and critics do&mdash;is virtually a negation of the past 30 years of guitar-based music, a relieved sigh that the values of the 70s aren't completely lost.</p><p>And... that works for a lot of people. Pearl Jam struck chords within listeners like few of their contemporaries. Those diehards probably looked at the Rearviewmirror tracklist and chuckled, wondering why it didn't include this rarity or that B-side (it does have a few key ones, e.g. \"Yellow Ledbetter\") or a handful of what the album rock stations used to call \"deep cuts.\" This comp isn't for them, though; it's for the rest of us, and a lot of listeners will likely glance at it, wonder where the hell \"Crazy Mary\" is, and consider it a handy career-spanner&mdash;all the Pearl Jam they'll ever need. If they buy it, those listeners will likely be surprised that&mdash;despite some non-descript titles (\"Corduroy\", \"Go\", \"Immortality\", the title track)&mdash;they remember most of these tracks, and despite slipping well below the radar, the band has, in many ways, improved over the years.</p><p>The record seemingly begins the same way as their debut, Ten, but this version of \"Once\" (like \"Alive\" and \"Black\") has been slightly re-mixed by Brendan O'Brien. Hardly radical and barely noticeable, the new versions buff the shine from the originals, actually improving three of the band's better, more melodic early tracks. On the album's first disc, the band's years of popularity&mdash;through third album Vitalogy&mdash;are only highlighted by the Singles track \"State of Love and Trust\" and the forceful \"Not For You\".</p><p>A lot of the other big guns are better left unremembered: The five-against-one mutterings of \"Animal\"; \"Evenflow\", \"Rearviewmirror\", and \"Go\" plod along, monuments to the appropriateness of the tag \"grunge\"; \"Spin the Black Circle\" is their first step toward the clumsy romanticism of bygone days; and \"Jeremy\" remains as painful as ever. Perhaps that last track is only truly powerful when coupled with images of Vedder's emotive pantomimes, hard-scrawled title cards that say things like \"the serpent was subtil [sic]\" and \"90210\", or a shirtless boy both wrapped in the American flag and standing in front of a wall of flames and crouching in the woods in front of an overblown photo of a teeth-baring fox...</p><p>On the up side, the garage-esque \"Do the Evolution\" is either over-the-top fun or completely ridiculous, depending on whether or not you believe Pearl Jam actually possess a sense of humor (in this case, I think it's the former), and \"I Got Shit\" (formerly \"I Got ID\"), \"Save You\", and \"Hail, Hail\" have a few more shades than the gray of the band's grunge era.</p><p>On the way down, things are also scattered. Like they do on the early rockers, Vedder's vocal diversions, tics, and lack of enunciation occasionally move from exaggerated emoting into self-parody (see, in particular, \"Given to Fly\"). His voice is still the band's hallmark sound&mdash;a mealy-mouthed, gravely style that influenced a decade of really, really shitty music&mdash;and it's still fun to impersonate; unfortunately, on pain-wracked attempts to convey more universal emotions (the glib \"Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town\", the lyrical disaster \"Wishlist\", \"Better Man\", the awkward cover of \"Last Kiss\"), it's not very fun to listen to.</p><p>Even when Eddie's opening his mouth, the tunes are often excruciatingly drab dirges&mdash;\"Immortality\" and \"Nothingman\" are the biggest offenders. (Yet ironically, the most overtly dirge-like track&mdash;the almost mantra-esque, Eastern-tinged \"Who You Are\"&mdash;is one of the set's most effective.) Elsewhere, the patient \"Off He Goes\", \"Nothing As It Seems\", and \"Man of the Hour\" and the solipsistic \"I Am Mine\" all carry a more weathered, wise sense of self, and these tracks greatly upstage the more youthful and clumsy neo-emoisms of the band's better known songs&mdash;in particular its ballads.</p><p>In some ways, it makes sense that Pearl Jam are improving as they slip further from the gaze of contemporary listeners and into the neolithic caves of mid-70s classic rock. For all the harm it unwittingly did to rock radio&mdash;and for as comical as it can be in its most unchecked moments&mdash;Vedder's voice is powerful and can even be captivating. The more considered and time-tested tones it now carries fit the band's more subtle shading.</p><p>In full ham-fisted stadium rock mode, Pearl Jam now oddly seem miles away from Nirvana, still the best of their one-time Seattle contemporaries. Instead, they're not-so-distant cousins to the denim brigade, the faceless 70s arena rockers who dutifully punched time clocks and produced no-nonsense, sometimes hook-filled rock. Today, Pearl Jam seems bruised, ever so slightly more adventurous, and, thanks to the devotion of their fans, they're afforded the chance to dress up as rock iconoclasts rather than take a slide toward VH1-ready adult contemporary balladry. It's like punk never happened.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Scott Plagenhoef, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Nearly 15 years after Ten, Pearl Jam finally returned to the strengths of their debut with 2006's Pearl Jam, a sharply focused set of impassioned hard rock. Gone are the arty detours (some call them affectations) that alternately cluttered and enhanced their albums from 1993's sophomore effort, Vs., all the way to 2002's Riot Act, and what's left behind is nothing but the basics: muscular, mildly meandering rock & roll, enlivened by Eddie Vedder's bracing sincerity. Pearl Jam has never sounded as hard or direct as they do here — even on Ten there was an elasticity to the music, due in large part to Jeff Ament's winding fretless bass, that kept the record from sounding like a direct hit to the gut, which Pearl Jam certainly does. Nowhere does it sound more forceful than it does in its first half, when the tightly controlled rockers \"Life Wasted,\" \"World Wide Suicide,\" \"Comatose,\" \"Severed Hand,\" and \"Marker in the Sand\" pile up on top of each other, giving the record a genuine feeling of urgency. That insistent quality and sense of purpose doesn't let up even as they slide into the quite beautiful, lightly psychedelic acoustic pop of \"Parachutes,\" which is when the album begins to open up slightly. If the second half of the record does have a greater variety of tempos than the first, it's still heavy on rockers, ranging from the ironic easy swagger of \"Unemployable\" to the furious \"Big Wave,\" which helps set the stage for the twin closers of \"Come Back\" and \"Inside Job.\" The former is a slow-burning cousin to \"Black\" that finds Pearl Jam seamlessly incorporating soul into their sound, while the latter is a deliberately escalating epic that gracefully closes the album on a hopeful note — and coming after an album filled with righteous anger and frustration, it is indeed welcome. But Pearl Jam's anger on this eponymous album is not only largely invigorating, it is the opposite of the tortured introspection of their first records. Here, Vedder turns his attention to the world at large, and while he certainly rages against the state of W's union in 2006, he's hardly myopic or strident; he's alternately evocative and specific, giving this album a resonance that has been lacking in most protest rock of the 2000s. But what makes Pearl Jam such an effective record is that it can be easily enjoyed as sheer music without ever digging into Vedder's lyrics. Song for song, this is their best set since Vitalogy, and the band has never sounded so purposeful on record as they do here, nor have they ever delivered a record as consistent as this. And the thing that makes the record work exceptionally well is that Pearl Jam has embraced everything they do well, whether it's their classicist hard rock or heart-on-sleeve humanitarianism. In doing so, they seem kind of old fashioned, reaffirming that they are now thoroughly outside of the mainstream — spending well over a decade galloping away from any trace of popularity will inevitably make you an outsider — but on their own terms, Pearl Jam hasn't sounded as alive or engaging as they do here since at least Vitalogy, if not longer.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>No, really&mdash;this album is the return to form that Pearl Jam fans have been waiting for since Ten. Or Vs.. Or Vitalogy. Or whichever album was the last on which Pearl Jam were a fully accredited rock band. This eponymous effort&mdash;the group's eighth      studio full-length, and first for J Records&mdash;is the most consistent effort the group's released since its second album. No pump organ-flecked spoken-word jags about insects, no meandering Eastern-tinged meditations on life, no songs about Jeff Ament's dog. Just 13 tracks of thoughtful, middle-aged, post-grunge rock'n'roll for the thoughtful, middle-aged, post-grunge fellow in all of us.</p><p>But it gets pretty boring pretty damn quick. Think what you will of the group, but there's no denying their growth. Despite having the wide eyes of Alternative Nation turned toward them&mdash;selling 17 million copies of their first two records&mdash;Pearl Jam decided to take the road less traveled, and that seemed to make all the difference in maintaining the band's creative viability. Of course, this choice is where they broke with the lion's share of their fan base&mdash;millions who bought into Pearl Jam's original MO weren't      willing to put up with creative wanderlust.</p><p>On Pearl Jam, that's what you get from start to finish (barring one accordion cameo in the minute long reprise of \"Life Wasted\"). While there's no shirt-rending Jesus Christ poses to be had here, this is as close to the righteous bombast of their heyday as they're likely to ever get again, for better or worse. One thing that has returned, unfortunately: An emphasis on Eddie Vedder's voice, an acquired taste's acquired taste. That his mushmouthed mewling and moaning became the template for a slew of copycat chest-thumpers is the      stuff that keeps vocal coaches up at night.</p><p>The \"weird\" Pearl Jam albums found Vedder's singing improving ever so slightly, to the point that he was actually singing without any odd affectations&mdash;the uh-huhs, the oooh-yeahs, the arghs. On this album, though, he's back to the multi-line mulching, growling for all he's worth through its more aggressive tracks.

		"review": "<p>Pearl Jam made peace with their hard rock past on their eponymous eighth album, but its 2009 sequel, Backspacer, is where the group really gets back to basics, bringing in old cohort Brendan O'Brien to produce for the first time since 1998's Yield. To a certain extent, the band has reached the point in its career where every move, every cranked amp, every short tough song is heralded as a return to form -- call it the Stones syndrome -- and so it is with Backspacer, whose meaty riffs have no less vigor than those of Pearl Jam; they're just channeled into a brighter, cheerier package. Despite this lighter spirit, Pearl Jam remain the antithesis of lighthearted good-time rock & roll -- they're convinced rock & roll is a calling, not a diversion -- but there's a tonal shift from the clenched anger that's marked their music of the new millennium, a transition from the global toward the personal. Ironically, by looking within the music opens up, as the group isn't fighting against the dying light but embracing how this most classicist of alt-rock bands is an anachronism in 2009. Of course, Pearl Jam were an anachronism even back in 1992, worshiping the Who instead of the Stooges, but this odd out-of-phase devotion to the ideals of post-hippie, pre-punk rock is better suited to bandmembers in their forties than in their twenties; fashion has passed them by several times over, leaving Pearl Jam just to be who they are, comfortable in their weathering skin. Pearl Jam battled their success for so long, intent on whittling their audience down to the devout, that it often felt like a chore to keep pace with the band because no matter the merit of the records, they always felt like heavy lifting, but that's no longer the case: here, as on the self-titled 2006 album, it sounds as if they enjoy being in a band, intoxicated by the noise they make. This means, all things considered, Backspacer is a party record for Pearl Jam -- a party that might consist of nothing but philosophical debates till the wee hours, but a party nonetheless -- and if 18 years is a long, long wait for a band to finally throw a party, it's also true that, prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun. [A Deluxe Edition was also released.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>If you're between the ages of, say, 25 and 35, chances are you either significantly overrate or underrate Pearl Jam. Either you carry a certain nostalgist's sentiment for one of your early rock touchstones (I fall into this camp), or you view them as the root of all that was overwrought and evil about mid-to-late-90s guitar music. Sure, everyone knows PJ sold eleven trillion albums between 1991 and '94, but still I imagine it's difficult for relative young'uns to reconcile how strong an opinion so many people in a specific demographic have about a group that hasn't been commercially or critically relevant for over a decade.</p><p>Backspacer, the group's ninth studio album, seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster. Virtually the whole record settles into the same formula the band's been dutifully churning out since the dawn of the millennium&mdash;lively but almost utterly hookless riff-driven hard rock. Lather, rinse, repeat. And when I say \"riff-driven\" I really mean \"almost entirely riff-dependent,\" because musically the riffs themselves are typically the only things worth your attention.</p><p>PJ's long-dormant punk and hardcore proclivities (ugh, \"Lukin\") have been rising to the surface with greater regularity in recent years, and I'll admit in short bursts this bulldozing approach can be somewhat satisfying. The opening four songs kick-start and then keep up a certain pleasing level of propulsiveness, with the goofily fast-and-loose \"Gonna See My Friend\" (hey, is that an actual bassline I hear?) and Thin Lizzy-ish double entendres of \"Johnny Guitar\" being particularly listenable. Sooner or later, however, you remember these guys wouldn't know a melody if it bit them in the ass. What's worse, this chugging blitzkrieg negates the power of the band's greatest weapon, Eddie Vedder's voice, which can display its craggy richness and masculine grace only when the band isn't trying to break land-speed records. (I know some folks hate Ed's singing, but it mostly seems like they're reacting to the fact that his voice launched a thousand Nickelbacks, which is like hating \"The Simpsons\" because of \"Family Guy\" or \"American Dad\".)</p><p>The gentle \"Just Breathe\" might seem like the perfect opportunity for Vedder to finally dust off those resonant pipes, but instead he sings the tune with a distractingly country-ish catch in his voice, plus the tune is numbingly syrupy and the lyrics, after a promisingly pointed start (\"I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love\") devolve into tedium. The same hit-or-miss sensitivity marks \"The End\"&mdash;Vedder inexplicably finds it necessary to remind us he's \"just a human being\" on one song and \"just another human being\" on the other&mdash;but at least \"The End\" manages to land on the right side of affecting thanks to its painfully honest depiction of romantic dissolution (\"This is not me/ You see/ Believe/ I'm better than this/ Don't leave\"). Still, we have to rely on \"Amongst the Waves\" to deliver anything remotely resembling the soaring anthemics that used to be a PJ trademark (what I wouldn't give for a \"Light Years\" even). The back half of the album sure isn't inclined to help, largely abandoning even the modest steamrolling enjoyment of the record's initial jolt in favor of thoroughly forgettable mid-tempo dreck, save for \"Supersonic\", which nonetheless sounds like a band trying to be the Ramones minus the fun.</p><p>It's an extremely odd thing to say about a band that for three or four years was the biggest rock megalith on the planet, but nowadays Pearl Jam are the very definition of anonymously workmanlike, seemingly plugging along with their heads down from one colorlessly unimaginative album to the next. Once upon a time this was a group that was on top of the world and yet still took all kinds of bizarre chances, recording shit like lengthy tape experiments and songs about bugs&mdash;often ridiculously self-indulgent, sure, yet always surprising. Now, paradoxically, with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Joshua Love, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<DIV align=left><B>THE GOLDBERG VARIATIONS AND MURRAY PERAHIA<BR></B><BR>Bach described the Goldberg Variations, his seemingly innocent tune followed by thirty variations, merely as a keyboard \"practice-piece,\" composed for his talented protégé Johann Gottlieb Goldberg to play on the harpsichord. But this scholarly exercise demands the kind of virtuoso skills to strike fear in the heart of any keyboard performer. Dexterity, speed, lightness of touch, dazzling independent fingerwork and, ultimately, deeply felt musicianship are essential ingredients of a reading. In addition, the passion and drama in Bach's music must be readily tangible.<BR><BR>The Goldberg Variations remained for many years a greatly admired but often avoided masterpiece. Over-respectful scholarship and careful musicianship had made it into one of those Great Works that few players were anxious to perform in public and only dedicated listeners really wanted to hear. Then, in 1955, an interpretation by the then-virtually-unknown pianist Glenn Gould forced musicians and listeners, fans and critics alike, to reassess Bach's monumental achievement. And now, nearly half a century later, Murray Perahia, unquestionably one of the greatest pianists of his generation, gives his own reading of this cornerstone work.<BR><BR>As the producer of some of Murray Perahia's early recordings, more than twenty years ago, it is hard to describe how heartwarming it is to hear the joy, pathos, audacity, drama, triumph, thoughtful reflection, and breathtaking virtuosity he brings to his deeply musical interpretation of this great work, helping to remind us why music is the most moving of all the arts.<BR><BR><B>Paul Myers</B> <BR><BR><B><BR>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE GOLDBERG VARIATIONS</B></DIV><BR>Playing the wonderfully varied, colorful and emotionally differentiated pieces that make up the Goldberg Variations is one of the most challenging experiences a pianist can face. Through all the joys or disappointments, the enthusiasms or frustrations that one goes through in learning the music, an overriding question always presents itself: How does so much invention, so much fantasy and imagination come from such a simple-seeming 32-bar aria based on a \"Fundamental Bass\"? After all, what is this Fundamental Bass, as Bach called it, but a series of chords, and not very complicated ones at that? Part of this question can never be answered because in a way it would be like defining genius, and what's more, a particular genius, Bach. Part of it, though, every pianist must answer for himself or herself, and this is my attempt to explain some of the things that were important to me.<BR><BR>First, I think, one must take a closer look at the chords of the \"Fundamental Bass\" because the inspiration for the entire piece is found in the accumulation and release of tension by the harmonies of these very chords. And certainly harmony was of crucial importance to Bach. In 1737, after Johann Adolph Scheibe had written a criticism of Bach's vocal music, claiming the compositions were deprived of their \"natural element by a turgid and confused style,\" Bach circulated a reply written by his friend Johann Abraham Birnbaum, defending the complexity of many voices when they serve to bolster or clarify the harmony. As Birnbaum wrote: \"Music consists of harmony, and harmony becomes far more complete if all the voices collaborate to form it.\" Seen from this point of view, these chords are the result of all the voices participating in and unfolding their tensions.<BR><BR>Below is a reduction showing the harmonic plan of the entire Aria (figure 1).<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG height=135 alt=\"figure 1\" src=\"http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89243/gfx/notes-1.gif\" width=475 border=0></CENTER><BR><BR>Though, quite naturally, the bass line leads and directs the general movement of the Aria, the top voice, or soprano, as the most exposed member, is an important contributor and not just incidental. The movement of the bass from G to D is answered by the soprano, traversing a fifth from d to g, a process delayed for a considerable time by its going to its own neighboring or auxiliary tone e2. The tension caused by these different forces creates the harmonies that we hear.<BR><BR>The structural chords of the Fundamental Bass are delineated in greater detail below (figure 2), with the numbers under the bass notes suggesting the movement of the other voices.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG height=299 alt=\"figure 2\" src=\"http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89243/gfx/notes-2.gif\" width=515 border=0></CENTER><BR><BR>As can be seen, the first 8 bars only define the tonic key (G Major), but in the next eight bars the music explores what seems to be the key of the dominant (D Major). After the double bar, the tension is driven a step further (quite literally, a step above D to E Minor). Here three voices take the place of the usual four, and the effect is more sorrowful than anything experienced thus far in the Aria. Finally, and most touching of all, in the last eight bars, the harmony returns to the tonic.<BR><BR><IMG height=57 alt=\"figure 3\" hspace=12 src=\"http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89243/gfx/notes-3.gif\" width=151 align=right vspace=4 border=0>Through the activity of the top voice in measures 25 to 27 (figure 3), we can see how the melody moves from e2 down to d2 and on to c2. At that point, measure 23, the motion is speeded up (everything is in semi-quavers to the very end), and the melody rises ever upward, delaying yet again its need to descend to g1 and transfiguring its return to the tonic. In a kind of extra-musical analysis, it is as if the melody were reaching for heaven before coming to rest on earth.<BR><BR>One reason I have dealt at length with the Aria is because it serves as the structural blueprint for the entire Goldberg Variations. Not only does the foregoing plan hold true for each of the Variations, despite their complex counterpoint and intricate canons, but the movement of the Aria is reflected in the progression of all the 32 pieces that make up the Goldberg Variations -- from the Aria through its 30 variations to its restatement.<BR><BR>Much has been made in the past of the importance of the number 3 in the Variations (for instance, a canon occurs every three variations). While that is true, I feel that the number 8 is more significant in terms of the dramatic contents. Thus, the division of the Aria into 8-bar sections with an overall caesura at the double-bar (after measure sixteen) is reflected in the structure of the whole piece. Counting the Aria as number one, the first break occurs after the eighth piece played, Variation 7, which is marked \"tempo di giga\" (Bach's own designation in the Handexemplar), a dance that always ends suites. The equivalent medial break in the Aria at measure 16 is mirrored in the Variations by a medial break after Variation 15, the sixteenth piece played. Indeed, Variation 16 signals a new beginning with a French Ouverture and accompanying fughetta.<BR><BR>When we reach Variation 24, a calming, pastoral canon at the octave, it is as if the piece were entering its final phase. After all, we should not be expecting more canons since intervals after the octave will be the same (i.e., the ninth equals the second, the tenth equals the third, and so on). Still, Bach surprises us with more canonic pieces -- the canon at the ninth and the Quodlibet -- but they will be part of the larger drama that ensues. Variation 24 along with Variation 25 are like the 25th and 26th measures of the Aria, the turning point. Indeed, with Variation 25, the temperature changes completely. The semitoned intensity of this darkly chromatic piece, the minor key, the desperate and anguished mood-- all these help to create what seems to be a programmatic depiction of the Crucifixion or, at the very least, of the deathly atmosphere it evokes.<BR><BR>After this and until the Quodlibet, all the pieces seem to have a headlong drive, much like the motion in semiquavers we noticed at the equivalent point in the Aria. The programmatic analysis here would be of the Resurrection: Variation 26, ascends like a soul in flight; Variation 27, an unaccompanied canon on the ninth, caught up in this same movement, is like two voices talking animatedly, perhaps even in mocking tones; Variation 28, with its very high register and shimmering trills is all transcendence; Variation 29 brings these trills back down to earth and to glory.<BR><BR>Finally, in Variation 30, the Quodlibet, with its earthy folk songs and animated rustic feel, comes the climax, and the accumulated motion of these last variations is at last released. The Quodlibet is a climax in many ways, in that while not a strict canon itself, it sums up the idea of canonic imitation in the most compositionally virtuosic manner. The Variations come to their final resolution with the restatement of the Aria. These noble, radiant lines bring the music to rest. Indeed its simplicity belies the complexity in this most moving of musical apotheoses.<BR><BR><B>Murray Perahia</B>"

		"review": "<p>The Wall was Roger Waters' crowning accomplishment in Pink Floyd. It documented the rise and fall of a rock star (named Pink Floyd), based on Waters' own experiences and the tendencies he'd observed in people around him. By then, the bassist had firm control of the group's direction, working mostly alongside David Gilmour and bringing in producer Bob Ezrin as an outside collaborator. Drummer Nick Mason was barely involved, while keyboardist Rick Wright seemed to be completely out of the picture. Still, The Wall was a mighty, sprawling affair, featuring 26 songs with vocals: nearly as many as all previous Floyd albums combined. The story revolves around the fictional Pink Floyd's isolation behind a psychological wall. The wall grows as various parts of his life spin out of control, and he grows incapable of dealing with his neuroses. The album opens by welcoming the unwitting listener to Floyd's show (\"In the Flesh?\"), then turns back to childhood memories of his father's death in World War II (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 1\"), his mother's over protectiveness (\"Mother\"), and his fascination with and fear of sex (\"Young Lust\"). By the time \"Goodbye Cruel World\" closes the first disc, the wall is built and Pink is trapped in the midst of a mental breakdown. On disc two, the gentle acoustic phrasings of \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" and the lilting orchestrations of \"Nobody Home\" reinforce Floyd's feeling of isolation. When his record company uses drugs to coax him to perform (\"Comfortably Numb\"), his onstage persona is transformed into a homophobic, race-baiting fascist (\"In the Flesh\"). In \"The Trial,\" he mentally prosecutes himself, and the wall comes tumbling down. This ambitious concept album was an across-the-board smash, topping the Billboard album chart for 15 weeks in 1980. The single \"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\" was the country's best-seller for four weeks. The Wall spawned an elaborate stage show (so elaborate, in fact, that the band was able to bring it to only a few cities) and a full-length film. It also marked the last time Waters and Gilmour would work together as equal partners.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rovi Staff</strong></p>"

Waters spins this off into a treatise on the futility of war, concentrating on the Falkland Islands, setting his blistering condemnations and scathing anger to impossibly subdued music that demands full attention. This is more like a novel than a record, requiring total concentration since shifts in dynamics, orchestration, and instrumentation are used as effect. This means that while this has the texture of classic Pink Floyd, somewhere between the brooding sections of The Wall and the monolithic menace of Animals, there are no songs or hooks to make these radio favorites. The even bent of the arrangements, where the music is used as texture, not music, means that The Final Cut purposely alienates all but the dedicated listener. Several of those listeners maintain that this is among Pink Floyd's finest efforts, and it certainly is an achievement of some kind — there's not only no other Floyd album quite like it, it has no close comparisons to anybody else's work (apart from Waters' own The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, yet that had a stronger musical core). That doesn't make this easier to embrace, of course, and it's damn near impenetrable in many respects, but with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction — Waters had no interest in a group setting anymore, as this record, which is hardly a Floyd album in many respects, illustrates. Distinctive, to be sure, but not easy to love and, depending on your view, not even that easy to admire. [The Final Cut was reissued in a remastered edition in 2004. This edition added \"When the Tigers Broke Free\" — originally heard in the soundtrack to The Wall, but its moody, war-obsessed soundscape is better suited for The Final Cut — as the fourth track, inserted between \"One of the Few\" and \"The Hero's Return,\" where it fits nicely into the album's narrative.]</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

Fans were eager for an album that sounded like classic Floyd, which is what Momentary Lapse was. But what they really thirsted for was a live spectacle from Floyd, where they could hear the old tunes and see all the old stunts. That's what they got on the 1987/1988 Pink Floyd world tour, which is documented on the double-disc set The Delicate Sound of Thunder. Gilmour's reunited Floyd was intent on recreating the sound and feel of classic Floyd, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the oldies feel like the classic records, only with Gilmour taking each vocal. He and Floyd deliver well, but this is a recreation that makes less sense on record than it did on-stage, where the nostalgia was justified. Here, it feels passable but never compelling. This is professional, competent, and, often, even enjoyable music, yet, like many souvenirs, it never once feels necessary.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

There's no question that the group is comprised of talented musicians, including the number of studio professionals that augmented the trio on tour. Whether they're inspired musicians is up to debate. A large part of Pink Floyd's live show is based on the always impressive visuals; on the Division Bell tour, they closed each show with an unprecedented laser extravaganza. In order for the visuals and the music to coincide, the group needed to play the sets as tightly as possible, with little improvisation. Consequently, an audio version of this concert, separated from the visuals, is disappointing. Pink Floyd play the greatest hits and the new songs professionally, yet the versions differ only slightly from the original recordings, making Pulse a tepid experience.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Sympathy takes a back seat to cynicism here, and while that strips the record of some depth, Prine's irreverence is consistently thrilling, making this one of his best. It's not as uniformly brilliant as the debut, but it did steer his music in a new direction -- where that record is often hallmarked for its rich sensitivity, Sweet Revenge established cynicism as Prine's dominant voice once and for all. Although he could still crank out a great ballad when he felt like it, from now on his records largely followed a more conventional rock & roll muse, a choice that eventually gained him more mainstream attention. \"Please Don't Bury Me,\" \"Christmas in Prison,\" \"Blue Umbrella,\" and \"A Good Time\" are a few of the jewels on this one.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Jim Smith</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Released in 1980 by Asylum, Storm Windows would be John Prine's last attempt to record on a major label. One reviewer referred to the album as Prine's \"best-sounding record,\" but one could argue that the production removes a great deal of the singer/songwriter's rough charm. While earlier albums like Diamonds in the Rough (1972) had seemed almost non-produced, Bruised Orange (1978) found the perfect balance between gruff and professional. Storm Windows isn't a bad album, but the songs and \"studio musician\" production lack the bite of Bruised Orange. The five-minute title track digs deepest, with Prine offering lovely lines like \"And down the beach the sandman sleeps/Time don't fly it bounds and leaps.\" One has to wonder, however, if lyrics like \"The spirits were high, til' the well went dry\" are autobiographical. Both \"Storm Windows\" and \"Sleepy Eyed Boy\" hint at disillusionment, as though an older Prine is looking back at his younger self. In this way, Storm Windows seems more confessional than early efforts like Sweet Revenge (1973). Other catchy pieces like \"Shop Talk\" and \"Just Wanna Be With You\" rock harder, but they're more or less throwaways. While Storm Windows captures Prine on autopilot, fans will enjoy listening to his reflections at this transitional stage.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr.</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Self-proclaimed prehistoric royalty Queens of the Stone Age are back from the desert wastes of California,     and they're putting the 'rock' back in 'blowing shit up' (in a healthy, non-terrorist kind of way).  Now,     it's no secret that, when it comes to rock's metal edge, these Queens want badly to be kings; you need     look no further for proof than 2000's blistering, thuggish Rated R, on which frontman Josh Homme's     searing guitars and theatrical vocals brought the band close enough to their goal to sniff the fleurs     de lis.  That, however, is history, and with Songs for the Deaf, the Queens have hit a new peak     in their development: the sound is more massive, the chaos is more calculated, and with hired gun Dave Grohl     at the kit, the band has an unprecedented drive that leaves them poised for their strongest bid for power yet.     \"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire\" embodies the greatest strengths of rock     at its hardest-- stunning riffs, breakneck speed, and guitars that churn and spit like a threshing machine.     It's riddled with decades-old metal cliches, but the Queens know what their audience expects, and they use     this knowledge to continually twist rock stereotypes into a vicious full-nelson until they beg for mercy.     It's fantastic, and this is just the first track.     \"No One Knows\" changes Songs for the Deaf's pace by sliding into an easy groove, sleazing its way     across a dimly-lit bar, half-drunk and reeking of cheap cologne, to put the moves on your girlfriend (or,     you know, you, depending).  This is four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality, folks, and it's the     second installment in this album's triad of genius, completed subsequently by the next track, \"First It     Giveth\". \"Giveth\" brings the drama like a champ, with Homme singing in pained falsetto over punishing riffs     during the verses, and opening up into aggro-overdrive for the appropriately apocalyptic chorus.     But along the path to greatness, there are pitfalls, and one Homme often falls into here is the old \"chamber     of lost souls\" effect (made popular by Alice in Chains on some of their later albums), which he uses to     fill out the backgrounds of some of these songs.  The multitracked Hommes aaah'ing melodramatically in     undead unison make slogging through \"Hanging Tree\" and \"Go with the Flow\" a pretty grim endeavor.  It     doesn't help that these songs churn along interminably long after their riffs have run dry, either.  And     worse still, the band has quit winking at their metal excesses entirely, toeing the line between mindless     fun and xFC-metal gothery.  Fortunately, this is only a temporary decline, but that these two tracks hit     back-to-back in the dead center of the record makes for a much steeper dropoff than if they'd been sequenced     farther apart.     There's also the issue of the between-song skits.  As skits go, these are pretty tame, but that doesn't     make them any less obtrusive.  The album even opens with one: the sign-on of KLON (that's \"clone\") radio,     \"the station that sounds more like everybody else than anybody else.\"  It's a broad parody of the Clear     Channel wavelength empire, and while admittedly pretty fucking funny, the target is a bit obvious--     especially given that PS2's \"Grand Theft Auto III\" beat them to the punch two years ago and pulled it off     expertly.  My biggest problem with these interruptions, though, is that they do little for the aggregate     effect of the album-- after a couple playthroughs, they only serve to stifle the momentum QOTSA manage     to develop.     Yet, this same biting cleverness also pervades many of the songs, lending an air of spontaneity and plain     good times-- there's a fake stop in one of the early tracks that's so ludicrous I laughed out loud.  And     there are even better moments to be had elsewhere: the wavering surf guitar on \"Another Love Song\", or the     good old-fashioned brain-sickness of \"Six Shooter\" and \"Mosquito Song,\" the latter played lovingly by what     sounds like the orchestra of the damned.     When these guys are on, it truly is the wrath of the righteous.  However, Songs for the Deaf     vacillates constantly between soaring heights and mind-numbing lows, making for a true hit-or-miss     affair.  But even if they can't have it all, the guys do offer as real a showcase of metal-tinged panache     and stellar songwriting as anyone might hope for from a band labeled 'stoner-rock.'  Besides, if the entire     album was as strong as the first three tracks, it'd probably burn you alive.  As it stands, Queens of     the Stone Age settle for attempted murder.  And that ain't bad at all.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Eric Carr, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p><i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> functioned as the starting point for <i>Up</i>, R.E.M.'s first album without drummer Bill Berry and their first that truly repudiates the legacy of jangle pop. Up is dominated by keyboards, muted percussion, buried guitars, and moody melodies -- only \"Daysleeper\" finds the group in familiar sonic territory. What's striking about the album is that it doesn't sound like a dramatic departure; even without the ringing guitars, it sounds like R.E.M., albeit R.E.M. trying to be adventurous and hip. To a certain extent, that's a good thing, since it proves that the band has developed a signature sound more elastic than many would have predicted, and that they are skilled enough to successfully take risks with their sound. Above all else, <i>Up</i> is an accomplished and varied record, the work of smart record-makers. It is also the work of veteran musicians -- for the first time, R.E.M. sound like they're playing catch-up, trying to keep their hip status intact. Occasionally, they pull it all together, as on the ominous opener \"Airportman\" and the darkly seductive \"Suspicion,\" but they stretch their capacities to the breaking point nearly as often, as on the Pet Sounds pastiche \"At My Most Beautiful,\" which comes off as second-rate High Llamas. Most of <i>Up</i>, however, falls in between those two extremes, winding up as self-consciously moody, down-tempo songs that fail to make an impression because they either don't take enough chances or they fail to speak directly -- they are simply well-crafted tracks that are easy to admire, but hard to love. Ultimately, that is what distinguishes this new incarnation of R.E.M.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>R.E.M. began their Warner contract in 1988 as the biggest band to emerge from the college-radio-fueled American underground. Fifteen years later, they released <i>In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003</i>, the first overview of their long stint at Warner Records. During that decade and a half, R.E.M. had a turbulent journey. At the outset, their legend and influence as one of the key &mdash; if not the key &mdash; bands of the American underground was firmly in place, but their success kept growing, culminating in a breakthrough to international stardom in 1991 thanks to \"Losing My Religion\" and <i>Out of Time</i>. For a few years there, they were one of the biggest bands in the world, standing as role models and godfathers for the alt-rock explosion of the '90s; even as grunge ruled the U.S. and U.K., R.E.M. were having their biggest hits with the brooding <i>Automatic for the People</i> (1992) and the guitar-heavy return-to-rock <i>Monster</i> (1994). Then, midway through the decade, the road got a little bumpy. The <i>Monster</i> tour was plagued with problems, the most noteworthy being drummer Bill Berry's on-stage aneurysm in 1995. He left the band the next year, not long after the band parted ways with Jefferson Holt, their longtime manager who was immortalized in their 1984 song \"Little America.\" Singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, and Mike Mills struggled to find their footing as a trio as they tackled more ambitious projects that found an ever more selective audience. Truth be told, this transition started on the final Berry album, 1996's <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i>, which found R.E.M. expanding their sonic template to acclaim from critics and hardcore fans, even if they started to see the audience they won over the previous decade start to shrink.</p><p>All this means the Warner era for R.E.M. doesn't represent one particular phase of their career &mdash; during their time at Warner, they went through two phases, with the first half being the culmination of their rise and the second being their awkward return to cult status. This divide is clear and fairly easy to pinpoint. In his track-by-track liner notes (neatly mirroring his notes for the 1987 rarities comp <i>Dead Letter Office</i>), Buck claims that dividing line is pre- and post-\"Losing My Religion,\" which is true at least as far as stardom goes, but it could be argued that the classic period ended with Automatic, since that follow-up to Out of Time showed that R.E.M. could not only live with the fame, but flourish within it. Everything that followed Automatic came from a different narrative and derived from a different starting point, one that was removed from the jangle pop that lay at the heart of their first ten years as recording artists. Related, yes, but quite different &mdash; more self-conscious, heavily produced, and deliberate, occasionally reaping great results but just as often sounding labored. It was a great contrast to early R.E.M., where the music seemed to flow naturally and easily. Though it has no early IRS material, In Time paints this contrast effectively, not only through the Green and Automatic material, but even through more recent material &mdash; the new song \"Bad Day\" and the 2001 revamp of \"All the Right Friends\" (contrary to Buck's claim in the liners that the band did cut this for IRS; it even appeared as a bonus track to a European reissue of <i>Dead Letter Office</i>). Both are built on a swirling, jangling folk-rock guitar line, propulsive rhythms, intertwined vocal harmonies, and urgent vocals from Stipe. In other words, they sound like classic R.E.M., and they should &mdash; they date from the '80s and bear co-writing credits with Berry. Unfortunately, they sound much fresher than the other new song, the overly fussy \"Animal,\" which is the problem with In Time in a nutshell: the two phases of R.E.M.'s career don't sit well together, but here, they're given close to equal space. R.E.M. the quartet does get more time than R.E.M. the trio, and the latter did produce some really nice tracks, which are chronicled here: \"The Great Beyond\" is a minor masterpiece, \"All the Way to Reno\" is the best of their faux-lounge phase, and \"Imitation of Life\" and \"Daysleeper\" are good classicist R.E.M. Still, the immaculate production of Pat McCarthy's work with Buck, Mills, and Stipe has a denser, heavier, more laborious feel than Scott Litt's work with Berry, Buck, Mills, and Stipe, and the two not only don't fit together, the oddity of the pairing points out that there are a number of missing singles &mdash; a full 17, if international releases and radio-only hits are counted (and, given the nature of '90s rock, they do count). And these aren't minor songs, either; they're modern rock radio staples: \"Pop Song 89,\" \"Texarkana,\" \"Drive,\" \"Ignoreland,\" \"Bang and Blame,\" \"Strange Currencies,\" \"Crush With Eyeliner,\" \"Bittersweet Me,\" and \"Shiny Happy People,\" the latter of which is roundly hated by the band yet nevertheless should be on a hits compilation for the sake of completeness. Of course, not all the songs could fit on a mere 18-track compilation &mdash; and if they went for a double-disc set, they'd be better off with a career-spanning set &mdash; but the song selection leaves something to be desired, even if it does present a reasonably accurate portrait of R.E.M. the adult alternative pop band, and it certainly does point out the inconsistencies of the band's Warner work. So, in that sense, In Time is an effective collection, but it also remains a little disappointing since it not only could have been done better, but by its very nature, this compilation can't help but point out the creative cul-de-sac R.E.M. found themselves in at the end of their Warner career. It's not the fate that anyone would have predicted in 1988.</p><p>[In Time was also released as a double-disc limited edition, encased in a see-through plastic slipcase and containing a poster of the trio, plus an extended booklet containing Buck's track-by-track notes for the 15-track collection of B-sides, compilation tracks, rarities, and oddities. Longtime fans should not see this as <i>Dead Letter Office</i>, Vol. 2. For one thing, by <i>Monster</i>, R.E.M. had run out of interesting non-LP rarities and started releasing an endless series of live versions as B-sides. Before that, a lot of the B-sides were instrumentals, not full-fledged songs. Those full-fledged songs were saved for various-artists compilation albums, and of those, there are two brilliant songs &mdash; \"Fretless\" and \"It's a Free World Baby,\" two <i>Out of Time</i> outtakes that Buck admits should have been on the album. Apart from that, there's only one more real non-LP song of note here, and that's the New Adventures outtake \"Revolution,\" which is of equal quality to the album. After these three songs, there are some good B-sides that nevertheless aren't much more than B-sides: the acoustic version of \"Pop Song 89,\" the rushed spoken word lark \"Chance (Dub),\" William S. Burroughs singing \"Star Me Kitten,\" a good alternate version of \"Leave,\" and worthy live versions of \"Turn You Inside-out\" and \"Country Feedback.\" Of course, it's hard not to notice that there are roughly 25 B-sides and compilation tracks that could have made the cut, and while none of them are consequential, longtime fans may wonder why such enjoyable instrumental throwaways like \"Memphis Train Blues\" were left behind, or why there's a seeming aversion to any of the good cover versions the band did during the '90s (including Syd Barrett's \"Dark Globe,\" Suzanne Vega's \"Tom's Diner,\" Iggy Pop's \"Funtime,\" and Richard Thompson's \"Wall of Death\"). Cuts like these may be missed, but this bonus disc is still a worthy way to get most of the non-LP highlights R.E.M. released during the Warner years, particularly because \"Fretless\" and \"It's a Free World Baby\" are so good. Finally, initial pressings of In Time carried a misprint on their spines that billed the collection as the best of 1998-2003, which could be seen as a revealing Freudian slip, in a way.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><p>The main peril of writing about R.E.M. is that otherwise rational people tend to form torturously private relationships with this band. I am one of them. As with any long-term engagement, there's a back catalog of injury: some of us felt slighted by R.E.M.'s eager dash to the big leagues; some can't get over \"Shiny Happy People\"; still others considered the band officially defunct when Bill Berry quit (consider, for a moment, the integrity of a band that makes a drummer's departure seem catastrophic). But now comes the ultimate challenge: helplessly watching R.E.M. sink into the classic-rock Lethe.</p><p>The symptoms came on fast: \"The One I Love\" gets a round of Clear Channel airplay on the flashback circuit, and the next thing you know there's a greatest hits package out there whose chronology begins with the band's seventh record. They're old. We're old. The upside is that I'm less likely to receive any mail telling me SUCK IT YOU PIECE OF SHIT REM R0X0RZ.</p><p>Questionable though it may be for these paragons of rock rectitude to milk the vile \"two new songs\" format for their latter-day hits collection, *In Time, in its own safe way, logically picks up where * Eponymous left off. So discuss the lopsided sequence and the strange curatorial choices (\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\" but no \"Drive\"?), but let's not forget that R.E.M.'s best tracks come pretty close to the pinnacle of what one can do with a riff, a verse and a chorus.</p><p>The obligatory Two New Songs included here are actually a song and a half: \"Bad Day\" spent about 15 years as a half-completed B-side famous for carrying the germ of \"It's the End of the World As We Know It\". The lyrics are new&mdash;angry and direct&mdash;but you can still scream \"I feel fine\" over the chorus, which has retained the original chord progression. \"Animal\", the other new track, is one of those vaguely Middle Eastern stomps that Buck's Rickenbacker occasionally throws up (see also: \"I Could Turn You Inside Out\", \"You\"), and has a great singalong hook, with Stipe gleefully yelping \"What's the big deal?\" as the harmony slides into a minor key. It would have been right at home on R.E.M.'s most substantive 90s offering, New Adventures in Hi-Fi.</p><p>As something of a commercial non-starter, Adventures is represented here by only two tracks: \"E-Bow the Letter\" and the cutie-pie \"Electrolite\" (whose space might have been more deserved by \"Bittersweet Me\"). Monster is, wisely, all but erased from the band's discography&mdash;only \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" made the cut (although sadly not the live Letterman version with vocals by Dan Rather). Up, the band's first album as a trio, is correctly represented by the majestic waltz \"Daysleeper\" and \"At My Most Beautiful\", which marks the start of R.E.M.'s current Brian Wilson fixation. The inclusion of \"All the Right Friends\", off the Vanilla Sky soundtrack, severely stretches the definition of the word \"hit,\" but the song (written in 1979) is baggage-free fun that deserves another shot. Of course, Automatic for the People is the clear winner here, at least by Warner's standards: this disc includes no less than four of its songs, which should make you feel pretty stupid if you a) own it, or b) don't.</p><p>The bonus disc on the album's pricier edition promises \"rarities and B-sides,\" but don't get your hopes up; it's long on live performances of hits and short on the kind of drunken studio fuckery that made Dead Letter Office such a blast. The highlights here are a fantastic trip-hop version of \"Leave\" (less a remix than a rescue operation, really), and a spare demo of Reveal's \"The Lifting\" that shows the precise moment at which the producers should have stopped fiddling with the material. There is one very welcome Dead Letter Office-esque track, though: \"Star Me Kitten\" narrated by W.S. Burroughs in a series of depraved howls.</p><p>And there you have it: a great album that you probably already own piecemeal, impossible to pan but even harder to endorse. In Time will make a handy proselytizing tool for weaning your niece off Matchbox 20. To you, it's an unintentional reminder that R.E.M. are a classic and still-relevant band not because of, but in spite of, their commercial success.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Idov, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

The anthemic guitar heroics present on Pablo Honey and even <i>The Bends</i> are nowhere to be heard here. Radiohead have stripped away many of the obvious elements of guitar rock, creating music that is subtle and textured yet still has the feeling of rock & roll. Even at its most adventurous -- such as the complex, multi-segmented \"Paranoid Android\" -- the band is tight, melodic, and muscular, and Thom Yorke's voice effortlessly shifts from a sweet falsetto to vicious snarls. It's a thoroughly astonishing demonstration of musical virtuosity and becomes even more impressive with repeated listens, which reveal subtleties like electronica rhythms, eerie keyboards, odd time signatures, and complex syncopations. Yet all of this would simply be showmanship if the songs weren't strong in themselves, and OK Computer is filled with moody masterpieces, from the shimmering \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and the sighing \"Karma Police\" to the gothic crawl of \"Exit Music (For a Film).\" <i>OK Computer</i> is the album that establishes Radiohead as one of the most inventive and rewarding guitar rock bands of the '90s.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Bonnie Raitt may have switched producers for her second album Give It Up, hiring Michael Cuscuna, but she hasn't switched her style, sticking with the thoroughly engaging blend of folk, blues, R&B, and Californian soft rock. If anything, she's strengthened her formula here, making the divisions between the genres nearly indistinguishable. Take the title track, for instance. It opens with a bluesy acoustic guitar before kicking into a New Orleans brass band about halfway through -- and the great thing about it is that Raitt makes the switch sound natural, even inevitable, never forced. And that's just the tip of the iceberg here, since Give It Up is filled with great songs, delivered in familiar, yet always surprising, ways by Raitt and her skilled band. For those that want to pigeonhole her as a white blues singer, she delivers the lovely \"Nothing Seems to Matter,\" a gentle mid-tempo number that's as mellow as Linda Ronstadt and far more seductive. That's the key to Give It Up: Yes, Raitt can be earthy and sexy, but she balances it with an inviting sensuality that makes the record glow. It's all delivered in a fantastic set of originals and covers performed so naturally it's hard to tell them apart and roots music so thoroughly fused that it all sounds original, even when it's possible to spot the individual elements or influences. Raitt would go on to greater chart successes, but she not only had trouble topping this record, generations of singers, from Sheryl Crow to Shelby Lynne, have used this as a touchstone. One of the great Southern California records.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In 1984, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were a long shot to make it to the 21st century. They were a party band back then&mdash;too funky for hair metal, too cock-obsessed for college rock. (And that name, perfectly encapsulating the band's essence while being incredibly gauche.) They wrote songs about their dicks; they then stretched cotton socks over those same dicks and jumped around on stage without fear of gravity. They were revered as a potent live act__,__ and got some songs on the radio, but they'd yet to make a strong step forward&mdash;their own label balked at giving them resources. The decade passed with small successes&mdash;a gold record for 1989's Mother's Milk&mdash;and unexpected tragedies, such as the death of founding guitarist Hillel Slovak, with the hope of something better to come. In the music world, they were definitely not a big deal.<p>And then, the world changed. By now, the hagiography about Nirvana's Nevermind* *has been well-repeated: It terraformed the radio into new, unfamiliar shapes, it sparked a 10,000% rise in flannel sales; it broke pained groaning as a pop sound, etc. But it also set the tone for a decade more permissive of what a popular rock band could sound and look like, in ways that would reverberate far away from grunge or flannel obsessives. Their success allowed a fomenting alternasphere of bands who didn't adhere to existing mainstream norms to rise up: Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden… and suddenly, the Chili Peppers. Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nevermind, a neat coincidence for historical records, and perfect timing for their attempt at fitting into a broader cultural milieu. In its title&mdash;a phrase as ridiculous as their name&mdash;were the irreducible elements of their previous records, distilled into a declarative statement.<p>Teenaged guitarist John Frusciante had been hired after the untimely death of Slovak, who passed away from a heroin overdose in 1988. Slovak rooted the band in their early sped-up punk-funk sound, a slurry molding of acts like Gang of Four, Jimi Hendrix, and Parliament-Funkadelic (George Clinton produced their second album, Freaky Styley). On those records, the Chili Peppers sounded like a live band trying to rein it in, with varying success. They'd never recorded two records with the same lineup, forcing them to continually jel on the fly. Frusciante changed all of that. His melodic instincts were languid and expressionist&mdash;a counterpunch to a rhythm section that wrote funk for moshing, allowing them to write open-hearted songs for the first time in their career. He found his footing following an up-and-down recording for Mother's Milk, which forced him to shed his identity as a kid playing with his heroes. \"The first year or so I wanted to be in the band so bad, I wanted to do a good job so much,\" he said in an oral history of the group. \"I was trying too hard to be like what I thought a Chili Pepper should be rather than just being myself… musically on guitar and in my personal life.\"<p>Part of this smoothing process was also due to their newly signed multi-million record deal with Warner, which pretty much necessitated they try to release something approaching a blockbuster. As producer, they brought in Rick Rubin, who by 1991 was already a monastic, perma-bearded guru with a reputation as band whisperer, having made high-profile career-best records with Slayer, the Cult, Danzig, and half the rap world. Unlike early producers, who gave the Chili Peppers specific direction and sounds to shoot for, Rubin allowed them to relax. Instead of recording in a studio, the band decamped to a spacious house in Laurel Canyon, where most of the members lived in between sessions. (Drummer Chad Smith commuted from his nearby Los Angeles home, because he was spooked by rumors the house was haunted; Frusciante reported once hearing a woman scream in some coital outburst, while Anthony Kiedis said psychic mediums had detected \"sexual energy\" in the house. Believe what you will.)<p>Funky Monks, a documentary capturing the whole operation, presents an interaction between Frusciante and Kiedis that sums up the pull-and-push between their newfound artistic focus and their irrepressible sophomoric fuckery. Frusciante, earnest and clean-shaven, is exuberant. \"We're making an amazing, amazing, groundbreaking, revolutionary, beautiful, artistically heightened, incredible record,\" he gushes. Next to him, Kiedis suppresses an eye-roll, deadpanning: \"If Baron von Munchausen had ejaculated the four of us, being the Red Hot Chili Peppers, onto a chessboard, I would have to say Rick Rubin would be the perfect chess player for that particular board.\" Frusciante, undone by his own guilelessness, grins like a dork.<p>But Kiedis was learning to be earnest, too. \"Under the Bridge\" might have remained a scribbled-down poem had Rubin not spotted it while flipping through Kiedis' notebook; he suggested he show it to the band, despite Kiedis' reservations that it didn't sound like it could be a Chili Peppers song. He was right, but that didn't matter: They worked out a tempo and key, and later, Frusciante came up with a lonesome chord progression for what would become their defining moment. The power ballad sounded wildly different than anything they'd ever recorded; the lyrics were completely unmuddled by Kiedis' rhetorical gesticulations, speaking plainly about an isolation felt after wandering the city in search of something your loved ones couldn't provide. Millions of MTV viewers didn't need to shoot heroin in order to connect with Kiedis' allusive plea to be freed from his demons: \"I don't ever want to feel like I did that day/Take me to the place I love, take me all the way.\"<p>The video, which featured the enduring shot of Kiedis running shirtless in slow motion toward the camera, looking very zen-Danzig, played constantly on MTV, pushing their record sales even higher. It legitimized them as a \"serious\" band, for all their denuded giddiness, and became a mainstay of MTV's \"Buzz Bin\" section, which plucked out promising singles and pushed them toward greater success. \"Buzz Bin\" videos were explicitly programmed to play three times a day, seven days a week, for eight weeks, while also receiving tangential news coverage around the network&mdash;and the Chili Peppers had two of them in \"Under the Bridge\" and \"Give It Away.\" In an era where MTV could still break new bands, that was no small tool in pushing their music to the mass audience they'd always craved. As they shared airspace with artful videos like \"Losing My Religion\" and \"Jeremy,\" a band that had once written a song called \"Party on Your Pussy\" was suddenly meaningful.<p>The faded, tender spirit of \"Under the Bridge\" went with yearning songs like \"Breaking the Girl\" and \"I Could Have Lied,\" both penned about Kiedis' doomed relationships. (The latter was allegedly inspired by a brief fling with Sinéad O'Connor&mdash;imagine *those *conversations.) They sounded sweeter, and somehow mature. For a long time, the Chili Peppers had been preoccupied with the grime and uninhibited physicality of sex. As Kiedis put it in his autobiography, which is punctuated every 15 pages with an X-rated anecdote: \"You're young and you're not jaded yet and so the idea of being naked and playing this beautiful music with your best friends and generating so much energy and color and love in a moment of being nude is great. But you're not only nude, you've also got this giant image of a phallus going for you.\"<p>That says it all, as does the album's subject matter. A lot of songs are about what the boys liked to do best. The title track? It's about fucking. The Cretaceous oogie-boogie of \"Funky Monks,\" in which Kiedis sneers \"Every man has certain needs/Talkin' ‘bout them dirty deeds\"? It's about fucking. \"Sir Psycho Sexy,\" an over-eight-minute wet dream defined by its burping bass tone and letter-to-Penthouse lyrics? It's about fucking. \"Suck My Kiss,\" with its \"Mr. Brownstone\" flow and fighter's groove? Definitely about fucking&mdash;and by the way, one guess what the original title was supposed to be? The unapologetic attitude toward sex was reflected in the extended jams that dot the album. The Chili Peppers saw no need for a 30-second outro when two or four minutes might work, creating extra time for dancing and whoever-knows-what.<p>You don't have to read the Kiedis book to intuit that the Chili Peppers saw nakedness not just as lascivious romp&mdash;though, of course, there was that&mdash;but as pathway to a more unconscious, unrestrained state. They weren't total goons; they were into mindfulness, and all that. The album opens with \"The Power of Equality,\" an explicitly anti-racist missive where Kiedis professes his love for Public Enemy and bellows \"Say what I want, do what I can/Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan.\" \"The Righteous and the Wicked\" intones about a forthcoming environmental apocalypse owing to man's selfish behavior, with Frusciante's guitar tone sounding like a dark cloud pumped through a smokestack. Their gestures toward social justice were hardly sophisticated, less a well-reasoned dialogue than a full-throated \"Racism fuckin' sucks,\" but that was the point. They were the partially-clothed id, barreling toward the funk and stumbling across inclusiveness along the way. During their performance at Woodstock ‘99, they were asked by Jimi Hendrix's sister to cover one of the late guitar legend's songs as tribute; they picked \"Fire,\" which they'd performed for years, and ripped into it right as real bonfires were spreading at the festival, leading to the not-inaccurate charge they were literally fanning the flames. They mostly meant well, but didn't always stick the landing.<p>They were also still sometimes prone to fratty, unjustifiable behavior: Kiedis was once convicted of indecent exposure, and Flea and Smith were charged with battery and sexual harassment after an incident where they spanked and yelled at a female fan present for an \"MTV Spring Break\" performance. Many more examples of inappropriate behavior are out there, and while it's easy to imagine their defense&mdash;\"We were just having fun\"; \"we got out of control\"; \"we were too drunk\"; pick one&mdash; it doesn't mean they weren't acting like assholes. This attitude found a home with a certain segment of listeners. In his book, Kiedis notes the label's concerns that \"a large segment\" of their fan base would be alienated by a shot in the video for \"Warped\" where he and Dave Navarro (who played with them in the ‘90s; it's a long story) briefly kissed. As they got older, the Chili Peppers never really grappled with the ramifications of all their bad behavior (like, say, the Beastie Boys). They were a classic Los Angeles rock band, a city where thousands of behaviorally repugnant transgressions have been ignored in the name of entertainment.<p>At their best, they folded their unbridled mentality into their burgeoning pop sensibility. \"Give It Away\" remains one of the memorable rock singles of the '90s. Led by Flea's hiccuping bass line, and filled out by Frusciante's chrome-plated guitar work, it split the difference between the lizard-brain rock of their early days and the blissed-out spirituality they would later adopt. Kiedis was extremely on one, waxing existential like a naked priest you find at Burning Man: \"There's never been a better time than right now\"; \"Low brow but I rock a little know how\"; \"Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue.\" Gutter-minded it seemed, lines like \"what I've got you've got to get it put it in you\" weren't sly ways of suggesting he'd like to hug and kiss you. (It's a reflection on how love&mdash;the spiritual, not physical kind&mdash;has to be *given *away, taken from a life lesson gifted by the musician and artist Nina Hagen, with whom he was briefly involved.) Likewise, \"Come and drink it up from my fertility\" wasn't only a literal request to suck his dick, even if he grabbed his junk in the video.<p>For all the snark that Kiedis'&mdash;shall we say&mdash;unique lyricism attracts, he was nonpareil amongst rock singers at chaining solecistic, seemingly dada-esque thoughts into melodically effortless, rap-inspired verse. Though the Chili Peppers would inevitably inspire \"rap-rock,\" that wallet-chained spectre haunting the conclusion of the ‘90s, Kiedis' rubbery delivery, filled with hard inflections to catch your ear, softened what could've been an ugly clash of styles. \"Give It Away\" was certainly the best example of that virtuosic talent. It was also aided by an instantly eye-catching video, directed by French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui, which must have been storyboarded simply: \"We're gonna take you to the desert, smear you in silver paint, and let you Chi Pep the fuck out.\" The indelible image of the shined-up Chili Peppers edited together in the same frame, writhing and flowing in balletic motion, snapshotted their vibe better than a million magazine profiles could.<p>Generation-signifying album it might be, it's hard not to notice that a quarter of the record could be lost at no harm. \"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\" sounds like the worst of the limpid funk-rap they'd later inspire; \"Apache Rose Peacock\" and \"Naked in the Rain\" are redundant with other tracks; \"The Greeting Song\" is openly despised by Kiedis himself, who said he was pushed to write it by Rubin. (Here he is, unequivocal: \"To this day, I hate that song. I hate the lyrics, I hate the vocals.\")<p>Of course, no one is listening to the album 25 years later because of \"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\". It's endured as a document of the moment when the Chili Peppers went widescreen&mdash;when they suddenly seemed like a band that might last for another 25 years. In 2016, the Chili Peppers signify nothing but themselves. But unlike the surviving members of the 1991 alt-rock class, their new music gets on the radio, and they remain massively popular by conventional metrics. (Their latest album debuted at #2 on the charts; a worldwide stadium tour is ongoing.) *Blood Sugar Sex Magik *is also a lodestone for a brand of more aggressive, politically negligent rock music that would emerge by the end of the ‘90s. Their red-blooded punk-funk hybrid was the Beatles to a generation of misunderstood, aggro listeners who started bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit, and that sound was best exemplified on this record. Maybe that's a dubious legacy, but it still makes them a significant reference point for any serious look at how the decade would turn out.<p>Flea once praised Chad Smith's drumming by saying he kept them from \"floating off into the sissy-boy ether,\" which explains their subliminal tilt toward jock rock. Nevertheless, a special mysterious something permeates the album. They were directly influenced by the darkened moods of Jane's Addiction, their closest peer in the alternative scene (which is part of why Navarro joined the band), who drove them to pull something unexplained from the fringes of their creativity. It's in the glitchy, lapping solo that plays in \"Give It Away,\" the ghostly flute touches on \"Breaking the Girl,\" the pyrotechnic outro to \"Sir Psycho Sexy.\" It's in the album's mythology: \"They're Red Hot,\" a cover of the apocryphally Satan-indebted Robert Johnson, was recorded outdoors on top of a hill, as though the band were communing with the dead. A cosmic weariness brought on by Kiedis' drug addiction, and the band's realization of mortality in the wake of Slovak's death, surrounds the songs. It's seen through the lens of antic cock rock, but it's there.<p>All of it set the stage for the whole mystical California thing that would define their later years, and allow them to grow into a legacy rock band. It unlocked their ability to write any type of song within the Chili Peppers framework, and enabled them to write their biggest album, Californication, upon Frusciante's reunion with the band due to a brief, exhausting separation. Frusciante would eventually leave again, and the band would struggle to reach the same creative heights, but it didn't matter. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Super Bowl halftime performance, the bass solo at Kobe's last game&mdash;they slowly became iconic, known by their mononyms and their socks and the pleasure of trying to imitate Kiedis' inimitable flow off the top of your head. Not bad for some Cali yucks.<p>&mdash; <strong>Jeremy Gordon, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

On 70 minutes of music recorded in a San Francisco club, Redman often indulges in close interplay and exciting tradeoffs with Metheny; the two clearly inspired each other. The recording quality is decent, and the performances overall actually exceed Wish in passion and creativity. Highlights include \"Blues for Pat,\" an 18½-minute version of \"St. Thomas\" and \"Carla's Groove.\" All Joshua Redman and Pat Metheny fans will want this one.</p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b>"

Those descriptions can certainly be applied to Redman's music, which, while pulling at the boundaries of modern hard bop, is also fairly easy to grab on to. Joined by his regular bandmembers of the period (pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade), Redman performs a full set of originals which, although not derivative, do fit into the straight-ahead tradition. At this point in time, Redman was growing from album to album, having already started at a high level. A fine outing.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Scott Yanow</b></p>"

Redman has long evinced the influences of such similarly inclined legends as Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and John Coltrane, and Back East is no exception — which isn't to say it's business as usual. Admittedly, while this is a straight-ahead acoustic jazz date, it is one ripe with creative energy that finds Redman's knack for deeply thoughtful improvisation and unexpected rhythmic interplay in full flower. Recorded prior to the passing of Redman's father, saxophonist Dewey Redman, in 2006, the album is dedicated in his father's memory and not only features the elder Redman alongside his son, but Redman even gives him a solo turn on the last cut. Interestingly, Back East finds Redman ruminating on alternate meanings of the title: as in the \"Back East\" of cities like New York and Boston or as in Eastern philosophies and religious beliefs. This leads Redman to myriad musical settings, including the funky swing of \"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" and the more raga-influenced and expansive post-bop of the original \"Zarafah.\" Joining Redman here is a cadre of top-notch rhythm players, including bassists Larry Grenadier, Reuben Rogers, and Christian McBride; drummers Ali Jackson, Brian Blade, and Eric Harland; and saxophonists Chris Cheek and Joe Lovano.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Matt Collar</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>Being Lou Reed in 1972 was a raw deal: two years after walking away from one of the greatest and most influential bands in rock history, he found himself a penniless, strung-out wreck, with a career suddenly and seriously on the wane.  To make matters worse, his self-titled solo debut, released earlier that year, was a monumental flop, a hastily thrown together collection of second rate re-recordings of Velvet     Underground outtakes that lacked the intensity and focus of his earlier music.  Reed was at a crossroads, unsure of which direction to take his newfound independence. At the same time, a new trend was emerging across the pond.</p><p>Glam rock began to flower in 1971, and by the following year had swept up countless British kids, turning them from restless, discontended youths to consummate, androgynous hipsters decked out in platforms, sequins and imposing hair.  It was the first mainstream rock movement to openly acknowledge the Velvets' influence, and in Marc Bolan, Ian Hunter and Bryan Ferry, Reed began to see his protégés: the coarse, primal rock 'n' roll he pioneered had found its     audience. One of his progeny, a young David Bowie, was hot off the success of his chart-topping The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, and was perhaps the most vociferous in his love of the Velvets and the     incalculable influence they'd had on his music.  When given the chance, Bowie and guitarist Mick Ronson offered to produce Reed's solo follow-up: what followed was undeniably one of both glam rock's and Reed's     finest moments, one that gave him a left-field radio hit and a blueprint for much of his solo work to follow.</p><p>Thirty years on, Transformer still sounds startlingly fresh, free from many of the clichés that taint other similarly minded records of the period. It also works as an interesting diversion from most of VU's work: where they clearly had a full-band aesthetic, and often leaned toward the avant-garde, Transformer took the strong pop undercurrent that ran throughout their records and indulged.  It's still fascinating to hear Reed outside the messy underproduction of the Velvets, yet even with Bowie and Ronson broadening the arrangements, Transformer feels remarkably natural.  Their production work was so loaded that, were it not for the incredibly focused songs beneath, it might have been overbearing. But with a solid base, the ornate arrangements help bring these songs to life, lending Reed's music a broader palette.</p><p>Lou himself, by contrast, sounds as intimate as ever on the record's more sedate tracks, crooning in a sensitive lilt that maintains his blissful, effortless cool. Transformer kicks off with the aptly titled \"Vicious\", a stiff, snot-nosed Godzilla of a rock song, decked out in leather and eye shadow, and drenched in the kind of punchy power chords intimately familiar to anyone owning VU's odds-and-sods compilations. Its gleefully tongue-in-cheek lyrics are among the album's highlights, with Reed's impetuous condescension beating down his subject's ego: \"When I see you walking down the street/ I step on your hands and I mangle your feet/ You're not the kind of person that I     even want to meet.\" Elsewhere, \"Perfect Day\" earns the distinction of being among the least characteristic songs Reed ever wrote; while its power ballad production and melody are enjoyable on their own terms, the song feels trapped under his dry vocal delivery, and falls somewhat flat as a result. \"Satellite of Love\" is still the bizarrely affecting centerpiece, serving as a poignant reminder of Reed's underrated gift for melody, which often eclipsed the signature, visceral abrasiveness he's more often recognized for. And of course, there's \"Walk on the Wild Side\", the classic tale of NYC gender-bending that garnered Reed the only real commercial airplay of his career.</p><p>This new edition adds acoustic demos of \"Hangin' Round\" and \"Perfect Day\", the latter notable for a newfound emotional push in its minimalism.  The remastering is nicely executed, clarifying the sound without bastardizing the occasionally dated production. This, along with the incredibly thorough liner notes and beautiful packaging make the reissue worthwhile for those who already own the record, and a must for first-timers just delving into Reed's solo work.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Matthew Stephens, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>River was a looser and rootsier affair than Terry Reid's first records, taken from a sprawl of sessions in London and California that generated enough material for several albums. The very looseness that gives the effort some charm is the same quality, however, that keeps it from being a major work. The songs mostly sound unfinished, as if they're friendly jams in which Reid and the musicians (including, most notably, David Lindley on half the album and percussionist Willie Bobo on the title track) are working out some song ideas or twisting around some riffs. It often brings to mind those parts of songs where the likes of Van Morrison, Tim Buckley, or Robert Plant sing-scat improvised-sounding vocal passages. The difference is that, for the most part, those singers used such sections to embellish solid songs. On River, the quasi-stream-of-consciousness vocal ramblings are the songs. The first four of the seven songs are very much in a funky, laid-back blues-rock groove, prominently featuring Lindley on steel, slide, and electric guitars. Reid, and the album itself, really begin to find more of an individual voice on \"River,\" where beguiling Latin-Brazilian elements are introduced in the guitar, melody, and rhythm. The final two cuts, \"Dream\" and \"Milestones,\" back Reid's vocals only with acoustic guitar, and have a romantic melancholy that likewise makes them highlights of this highly personal but uneven record.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p><hr/><p>Much is made of the failures of Terry Reid's career. The man who turned down the vocalist slot in Led Zeppelin (and recommended Robert Plant to Jimmy Page); the man who as a teenage prodigy had his early albums irreparably mangled by manager/producer Mickie Most; in short a man who many name-drop as the artist who fate dealt a bad hand. Yet, few people actually mention his triumphs. For, following a seemingly endless search for a sound and working methodology to suit his incredible voice, Reid did strike creative gold by the early 70s and River was to be his masterpiece.</p><p>High profile tours in the US throughout the late 60s supporting the likes of Cream and the Rolling Stones (Terry was at Altamont on that fateful night) honed his craft into something almost totally new at the time. On his journey he'd befriended legendary multi-instrumentalist David Lindley of psychedelic world music pioneers, Kaleidoscope (coincidentally one of Jimmy Page's favourite bands), whose slide work graces River. An incendiary live turn was captured on film during the 1971 Glastonbury festival and it showed how Terry's funky folk blues was evolving into a similar abstraction that Van Morrison had stumbled over with Astral Weeks.</p><p>It's this jazzy abstraction that makes River such a treasure. With Lindley in tow, Reid made his first attempt to capture his muse in London with Yes's engineer Eddie Offord, but too much 'looseness' made the results somewhat frustrating. Only the freeform acoustic tracks, ''Dream'' and ''Milestones'', survive from these sessions and, while the meandering scat style is hard to grasp at first, the whole ambience is insidious, just as the theme of the river and its journey pervades the whole album.</p><p>Moving to America and working with Atlantic Recordsüber-producer Tom Dowd, the album became a yin-yang experience, with its first side a bluesy electric trip through just three prolonged jams, and the second featuring the two aforementioned tracks plus two other acoustic beauties (''Live Life'' and the sublime ''River'').</p><p>Lindley's guitar work is as fluid as Reid's way with words. Phrases and lines become mere sounds in Terry's mouth. To call these tone poems 'rambling' is to misunderstand the deeply charged emotion and pioneering spirit that marked the turbulent recording process. The river theme is perfectly mirrored by song structures that flow, ebb and never, for one instant, remain static. Of course, the Reid jinx wasn't lifted by this wonderful album. One more classic (Seed Of Memory) was to follow in 1976 and then it seemed as if Terry and the world reconciled themselves to never being as huge as he undoubtedly deserved to be. His influence on subsequent artists was, however, significant. Just try listening to Robert Palmer's Sneaking Sally Through The Alley after this album! Reissued at last, now the world can finally catch up.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Chris Jones</strong></p>"

Most of the Stones' early albums suffer from three or four very weak cuts; Now! is almost uniformly strong start-to-finish, the emphasis on some of their blackest material. The covers of \"Down Home Girl,\" Bo Diddley's vibrating \"Mona,\" Otis Redding's \"Pain in My Heart,\" and Barbara Lynn's \"Oh Baby\" are all among the group's best R&B interpretations. The best gem is \"Little Red Rooster,\" a pure blues with wonderful slide guitar from Brian Jones (and a number one single in Britain, although it was only an album track in the U.S.). As songwriters, Jagger and Richards are still struggling, but they come up with one of their first winners (and an American Top 20 hit) with the yearning, soulful \"Heart of Stone.\"</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

A strong acoustic Delta blues flavor colors much of the material, particularly \"Salt of the Earth\" and \"No Expectations,\" which features some beautiful slide guitar work. Basic rock & roll was not forgotten, however: \"Street Fighting Man,\" a reflection of the political turbulence of 1968, was one of their most innovative singles, and \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" with its fire-dancing guitar licks, leering Jagger vocals, African rhythms, and explicitly satanic lyrics, was an image-defining epic. On \"Stray Cat Blues,\" Jagger and crew began to explore the kind of decadent sexual sleaze that they would take to the point of self-parody by the mid-'70s. At the time, though, the approach was still fresh, and the lyrical bite of most of the material ensured <i>Beggars Banquet's</i> place as one of the top blues-based rock records of all time.</p><p>[The Rolling Stones' London/ABKCO catalog was reissued in August of 2002, packaged in digipacks with restored album artwork, remastered, and released as hybrid discs that contain both CD and Super Audio CD layers. The remastering — performed with Direct Stream Digital (DSD) encoding — is a drastic improvement, leaping out of the speaker yet still sounding like the original albums. This is noticeable on the standard CD layer but is considerably more pronounced on the SACD layer, which is shockingly realistic in its detail and presence yet is still faithful to the original mixes; Richards' revved-up acoustic guitar on \"Street Fighting Man\" still sends the machine into overdrive, for instance. It just sounds like he's in the room with you. Even if you've never considered yourself an audiophile, have never heard the differences between standard and gold-plated CDs, you will hear the difference with SACD, even on a cheap stereo system without a high-end amplifier or speakers. And you won't just hear the difference, you'll be an instant convert and wish, hope, and pray that other artists whose catalog hasn't been reissued since the early days of CD — Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, especially the Beatles — are given the same treatment in the very near future. SACD and DSD are that good.]</p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b>"

		"review": "<p>Live'r Than You'll Ever Be is a bootleg recording of the Rolling Stones' concert in Oakland, California, from 9 November 1969. It was one of the first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States. The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones' label Decca Records to release the live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. Live'r is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history, released in December 1969, just two months after the Beatles' Kum Back and five months after Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder. Like the two earlier records, Live'r's outer sleeve is plain white, with its name stamped on in ink.</p><p>Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was recorded by \"Dub\" Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser shotgun microphone and a Uher \"Report 4000\" reel-to-reel tape recorder. It was the first audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed;  some sources consider it the first live bootleg. Though the sound is not nearly as clear as the official release of Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording, especially one of that era. The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound. Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States, recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album. At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham's staff, who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970.</p><p>The recording was made available about one month after the concert, and it became popular enough to spur speculation that the Stones released Ya-Ya's as a response to the bootleg and the quality was high enough that it was rumoured that the band had even released the bootleg themselves. The recording has been released through several bootleg labels, including the original release by Lurch and shortly thereafter Trademark of Quality (catalogue number 71002), Swingin' Pig, and Sister Morphine, usually documenting only the second set. The Swingin' Pig release even replace performances of \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and \"Under My Thumb\" with different recordings from the band's 10 November performance in San Diego and their two-night stint in New York City and attempted to enhance the sound quality by using de-clicking technology—both changes have drawn criticism in comparison to the original Lurch Records release.</p><p>Live'r Than You'll Ever Be was favourably reviewed by Greil Marcus in the 7 February 1970 issue of Rolling Stone. He praised its sound and speculated that it may have been recorded from the stage; footage from this concert was recorded by ABKCO Records for the film Gimme Shelter. The album also received praise as a more authentic example of the Stones on stage because Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! was heavily overdubbed in many places. Richie Unterberger has noted that the recording is inferior to the sound quality of Ya-Ya's, but displays a spontaneity that the official recording lacks and this helps to explain its long-lasting appeal to fans. Reviewing the album in 1970, Wim Wenders called it \"the best Rolling Stones record.\"</p><p>The album eventually sold enough to qualify for a gold record RIAA certification, with TMOQ sources claiming that it had sold 250,000 copies by November 1970; 150,000 of which were produced by other bootleggers. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, the magazine included it in a list of best-selling bootlegs in 1971, noting that hard sales figures were impossible to confirm, but six-figure numbers had been routinely discussed. The sleeve's generic design was copied by The Who's 1970 album Live at Leeds.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Wikipedia</strong></p>"

Part of the reason why the record was initially greeted with hesitant reviews is that it takes a while to assimilate. A sprawling, weary double album encompassing rock & roll, blues, soul, and country, Exile doesn't try anything new on the surface, but the substance is new. Taking the bleakness that underpinned Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers to an extreme, Exile is a weary record, and not just lyrically. Jagger's vocals are buried in the mix, and the music is a series of dark, dense jams, with Keith Richards and Mick Taylor spinning off incredible riffs and solos. And the songs continue the breakthroughs of their three previous albums. No longer does their country sound forced or kitschy -- it's lived-in and complex, just like the group's forays into soul and gospel. While the songs, including the masterpieces \"Rocks Off,\" \"Tumbling Dice,\" \"Torn and Frayed,\" \"Happy,\" \"Let It Loose,\" and \"Shine a Light,\" are all terrific, they blend together, with only certain lyrics and guitar lines emerging from the murk. It's the kind of record that's gripping on the very first listen, but each subsequent listen reveals something new. Few other albums, let alone double albums, have been so rich and masterful as Exile on Main St., and it stands not only as one of the Stones' best records, but sets a remarkably high standard for all of hard rock.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Legendary as it may be, Exile on Main St. presents a challenge for deluxe remastered reissues. Much of its myth lies in its murk, how its dense, scuzzy sound is the quintessential portrait of rock stars in decadent isolation, the legend bleeding into its creation so thoroughly it is impossible, and unnecessary, to separate one from the other. Without this nearly tactile sound, Exile wouldn’t be Exile, so remastering the record is a tricky business because it should not be too clean. The remaster on the 2010 reissue -- available in a myriad of editions containing variations of a single-disc remaster and a second disc expanded with ten unreleased tracks - doesn’t quite avoid that trap. When “Rocks Off” kicks off the record, what was previously dulled like aged silver is now is too bright: Mick Jagger’s vocals leap and the keyboards ring clearly. Because this is Exile on Main St., a record recorded in a decaying French mansion, it’s impossible to scrape all the grime away from its layers, but the overall impression is that the original master tapes are now presented in high definition: it’s possible to hear what most individual instruments are doing on each track, which may lead for a greater appreciation of the Stones' monumental musicianship, but it’s somewhat at the expense of the album’s mystique.</p><p>Another pitfall in the plans for this deluxe expansion: there aren’t a whole lot of completed unreleased songs. The Stones had a habit of working leftovers from the prior album into a finished product, sometimes taking years to complete a song -- a practice that resulted in great songs but not much left in the vaults. Which isn’t to say there was nothing left behind from Exile’s sessions: the Stones were living where they were recording, so they produced an enormous amount of music, working out the kinks in a song (represented here by alternate takes of “Loving Cup” and a Keith Richards-sung “Soul Survivor”), or wholly reworking an existing song as they did with the loose-limbed “Good Time Women,” which was later revised as “Tumbling Dice.” On occasion, they completed a song that didn’t make the cut, such as “I’m Not Signifying,” a heavily bootlegged shambolic blues that is just about as good as anything on the finished album, but usually they created instrumental beds designed to be completed later with vocals. In this particular case, a handful of these tracks were completed much, much later, with the band finishing up the songs some 38 years later for this deluxe edition. A great deal of attention was paid to making the new additions relatively seamless, with the band going so far as to bring in the long-departed guitarist Mick Taylor for some overdubs. If the end results don’t quite feel as thick as Exile, they nevertheless do feel remarkably like the classic Taylor era. Apart from “Following the River” -- a drowsy piano ballad that tries to rouse itself to blues-gospel -- these are good, sometimes excellent songs, particularly the loose, hip-shaking “Dancing in the Light” and the charging “Plundered My Soul.” At first it's hard not to stare at these hybrid tracks with skepticism, particularly because they’re eating up room that could have been used for other alternate takes, or perhaps the instrumentals themselves, or the occasional bootlegged song that didn’t make the cut, such as “Blood Red Wine,” but once that suspicion fades, you’re left with a handful of very good additions to the Stones songbook -- songs that don’t hold a candle to Exile but are remarkable re-creations of Taylor-era rock & roll, songs that could easily have been slid onto It’s Only Rock 'N Roll, when the group was easing into their grooves, confident that they were the greatest rock & roll band on earth.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Despite an absence of the band's best-known songs, the sweaty, grimy Exile on Main St. has grown into the Rolling Stones' most universally acclaimed record. Despite dozens of hits, putting together a cohesive album often seemed to be beyond the Stones, tripped up by either manager Allen Klein's publishing-rights parasitism or the band's 1970s hubris. That leaves a catalog in which only Exile is built not on hits but on vibe and: the album's singularly sleazy sound and making-of legend.</p><p>To create Exile, the band escaped Britain as tax exiles, decamping to a French villa. Paradoxically, the posh surroundings created the band's rawest effort. They were a heroin-ragged band, jamming late into the night with calloused fingers and vocal cords in a stale basement with sweaty walls. So the best thing a remastered reissue of the record can do is not give the production a bath, a shave, and a haircut. Happily, this new cleanup job doesn't Photoshop out the flaws and flubs, with the band's loose performances still presented in all its debauched glory.</p><p>Of course, like most treasured nuggets of rock history, that story is undermined by pesky facts. In Stones in Exile, the documentary released with this 38th anniversary reissue, producer Jimmy Miller talks about isolating each band member in a different room of the villa to make the impromptu studio work. That's a fitting image for the Rolling Stones at the time&mdash;while the band was musically at its peak, it was in practice at its most fractured, with singer Mick Jagger and bassist Bill Wyman barely involved for the bulk of the recording. The Exile we know and love is actually the hybrid product of two sessions, two bands really: the Keith Richards-led material from Nellcôte shotgun-wed to the Los Angeles gospel dabbling of Jagger and co-conspirator, keyboardist and former Beatles collaborator Billy Preston.</p><p>In a way though, Jagger's lack of involvement may have been the key to Exile's success (and probably explains his oft-voiced dislike of the record). With Richards at the helm, the record sounds closest to the American roots music the band relentlessly name-dropped. Vocally, Richards' nasal whine fights for space with Jagger more than anywhere else in their history, adding thrillingly imperfect harmonies. The rest of the supporting cast also gets more of the spotlight: the brilliant barrelhouse piano of Nicky Hopkins singlehandedly defines \"Loving Cup\" and \"Torn and Frayed\", Mick Taylor adds counterpoint leads and the toodling bassline of \"Tumbling Dice\", Al Perkins' pedal steel and Bobby Key's sax contributes soul and country cred.</p><p>But despite his relative absence, Jagger's contributions on the back half of the record give Exile its dramatic arc. Though the album's concept record status has always been somewhat oversold, the plot does chart a rough path from drunken late-night revelry to next-day regret: The last third of the record looks back on the first two-thirds with a wince and a headache. \"I Just Want to See His Face\", \"Let It Loose\", \"Shine a Light\"&mdash;there's a profound need for redemption here unique to the Stones, an odd moment of guilt for a band known for consequence-free sexual bluster. As the last complete sentence of the album says, \"you're going to be the death of me.\"</p><p>Unlike the album proper, the bonus tracks are given a clean scrubbing, and it's blatantly obvious in places that Jagger's vocals are circa 2009, not 1972. That added grooming offers the experimental results of an Exile sans Nellcôte&mdash;still a band in the zone, but more Jagger-dominant and sterilized. Still, many of the unreleased songs work: \"Plundered My Soul\", wins on the merits of its falsetto backing vocals, and \"So Divine (Aladdin Story)\" is like a pastiche of Aftermath-era Stones played by an older, saltier band.</p><p>If allowing Jagger to touch up those vocals was the price to pay to allow Exile receive the tribute it deserves, it's still a bargain. All the same, it's a bit strange to see the Stones, somehow still alive, on the talk show circuit celebrating the product of their darkest years, treating their addictions, tax evasion, and near-breakup as just a colorful set piece on Rolling Stones: The Ride. The true thrill of Exile on Main St. is that it doesn't require all that backstory to be dramatized and Ken Burns-ed&mdash;all the pain, fun, joy, and regret of being the biggest rock band on Earth, kinda loving it and kinda hating it, is right there in the filthy grooves of the record. Oh, what a beautiful buzz.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Not an official Rolling Stones release, the assembled band does contain three-fifths of the group (Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts) along with session man extraordinaire Nicky Hopkins and guitarist Ry Cooder. The band stumbles through keyboard-dominated original numbers such as \"Boudoir Stomp\" and \"Edward's Thrump Up,\" as well as more conventional cuts like a cover of Elmore James' \"It Hurts Me Too.\" Yet the songs never get beyond giving the listener the impression they were thrown together during a drunken night's rehearsals. In that sense the album is a bit of a letdown; though any Stones fan would surely clamor for lost material from the band's golden age, Jamming With Edward instead makes one wish it had never been released.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Kurutz</strong></p>"

From that platform, the idea of taking it back to small clubs, live, lean and pared down without succumbing to the worn \"unplugged\" treadmill, seemed an inspired move. Patched together from an embroidery of tour rehearsals and live club dates in Paris and Amsterdam, the project was an extension of acoustic sets the group introduced on the North American leg of the Voodoo Lounge tour. The concept offered an invigorating opportunity to dust off some rough gems from the past that no longer felt at home on scoping stadium stages. Unfortunately, the cover photo depicting a lean, determined, leather-clad combo in spartan black and white proves to be misleading advertising. Within the brave packaging lies a listless, lethargic Dorian Gray bluff. Spongy keyboards gunk many of the tracks. The much-touted cover of Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\" remains pointlessly devoted to the original. There are lazy, somnambulant versions of \"I'm Free\" and \"Let It Bleed\"; Keith Richards' painfully intoned \"Slipping Away\"; the dozens of lost songs that any fan would chose to have renovated before \"Angie.\"</p>&mdash; <b>Roch Parisien</b>"

Where Elvis' set is hurt by the simple fact that there are too many damn Elvis comps on the market, the Rolling Stones benefit greatly from the fact that there has not been any set that chronicles all their recordings from the '60s through the '90s. It also benefits that this is the concept behind the record -- it's meant to be a journey through their biggest songs, not just the number one hits. Of course, the Stones couldn't have had a CD containing just their number ones that spanned one disc, much less two, because they never topped the charts that frequently. This is a liberating thing (compare it to Elvis', which got weighed down with the number ones, resulting in some subpar selections), since it opens the door for almost every Stones song of note to feature on this collection, along with four new songs (not great, but solid songs, all). Sure, there are many great Rolling Stones moments missing, and not just fan favorites Beggars Banquet or Exile on Main St., either -- \"Play With Fire,\" \"2000 Light Years From Home,\" \"Tell Me,\" \"Heart of Stone,\" \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\" \"Lady Jane,\" \"Time Is on My Side,\" \"Waiting on a Friend,\" \"I'm Free,\" and \"We Love You\" are all missing in action. The thing is, as the disc is playing, you don't miss any of them, and it feels like all the hits are here. At first, the nonchronological order seems to be a mistake, but both discs flow well, especially since they're roughly divided thematically (the first is devoted largely to the '60s, with the rest on the second). Yes, the Stones made great albums that should be in any serious rock collection, but if you just want a summary of their best moments, Forty Licks is it; it does its job as well as Beatles 1 did.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Listening to Something/Anything? is a mind-altering trip in itself, no matter how many shamelessly accessible pop songs are scattered throughout the album, since each side of the double-record is a concept unto itself. The first is \"a bouquet of ear-catching melodies\"; side two is \"the cerebral side\"; on side three \"the kid gets heavy\"; side four is his mock pop operetta, recorded with a full band including the Sales Brothers. It gallops through everything -- Carole King tributes (\"I Saw the Light\"), classic ballads (\"Hello It's Me,\" \"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\"), Motown (\"Wolfman Jack\"), blinding power pop (\"Couldn't I Just Tell You\"), psychedelic hard rock (\"Black Maria\"), pure weirdness (\"I Went to the Mirror\"), blue-eyed soul (\"Dust in the Wind\"), and scores of brilliant songs that don't fall into any particular style (\"Cold Morning Light,\" \"It Takes Two to Tango\"). It's an amazing journey that's remarkably unpretentious. Rundgren peppers his writing with self-aware, self-deprecating asides, indulging his bizarre sense of humor with gross-outs (\"Piss Aaron\") and sheer quirkiness, such as an aural tour of the studio at the beginning of side two. There are a ton of loose ends throughout Something/Anything?, plenty of studio tricks, slight songs (but no filler), snippets of dialogue, and purposely botched beginnings, but all these throwaways simply add context -- they're what makes the album into a kaleidoscopic odyssey through the mind of an insanely gifted pop music obsessive.</P><P>— <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>Terje Rypdal's recordings offer the listener an astounding array of styles - ranging from straight-ahead jazz played in small-combo settings to solo outings to mind-bending improvisations to orchestral compositions, and all points in between. His composition and playing and arranging are always tasteful and excellent, and the musicians he selects to execute his works are consistently first-rate. BLUE is no exception, falling into a trio of albums featuring roughly the same personnel, The Chasers - Terje on electric guitar (also adding some keyboard touches on this recordings), Bjørn Kjellemyr on electric and acoustic basses, and Audun Kleive on drums and percussion. The same players appear on Terje's previous album, CHASER, and on THE SINGLES COLLECTION (with the addition of Allan Dangerfield on keyboards). This is one of those delightful instances of musicians being so sensitively attuned to each other that they literally perform as a unit, delivering some astonishingly powerful and well-executed performances.Opening with the short intro track 'The curse', then moving deftly into the powerful 'Kompet Går', the set takes the listener through a breathtaking experience featuring both hard-edged and gently beautiful arrangements. Terje's guitar is the only 'lead' instrument in a traditional sense, but the basses and drums of his bandmates are equally in play here. Listen to the funk-driven string-snapping and sliding chords produced by Kjellemyr on 'Kompet Går', and the incredibly precise percussive bursts from Kleive on the same track - they set the stage nicely for Terje's entrance. His playing, as always, is stunning - listen to his trademark attack-muting, as well as his amazing innate melodic sensibilities...and turn it right up! This is an album that deserves extra volume - not to blast the neighbors, but to experience the dynamic subtleties involved.</p><p>As I mentioned, Terje has produced a lot of variations during his long and distinguished career - this is a great straight-ahead album to initiate new listeners, as well as (speaking as a long-time fan of ALL of his work) one of my overall favorites in his catalogue. Also check out (besides the other two with this band, mentioned above), ODYSSEY and WHENEVER I SEEM TO BE FAR AWAY (great early works), AFTER THE RAIN (a solo effort, where Terje plays everything), WAVES and DESCENDRE (his earliest work with frequent collaborator, trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg), EOS (an incredible duet album with cellist David Darling) and LUX AETERNA (his latest, one of his orchestral outings). His catalogue, almost entirely on Manfred Eicher's ECM label, is (thankfully) large and varied - and all of it very, very good.</p>"

		"review": "<p>With over 20 records under his own name and countless more as a collaborator, band member, or guest, guitarist Terje Rypdal has written and performed virtually in all styles of music that emanate from classical or jazz. As an improviser he is a brilliant thinker and spontaneous composer. As a proper composer he has written everything from pop singles to symphonies. Skywards is a return to jazz proper for Rypdal. He surrounds himself with familiar faces for this date, including cellist David Darling, bassist Palle Mikkelborg, Jon Christensen on drums, and Terje Tønnesen on violin. Also employed are Christian Eggen on piano and electronic keyboards and the additional drumming and percussion talents of Paolo Vinaccia. Rypdal's signature guitar sound, present in every moment of his solo breaks, has a soaring, piercing kind of emotional reach. It is indeed \"skyward\" in its sound. On this date he marries postmodern jazz (which sometimes harks back to its swinging past) with European improvisation, his own take on classical music (which sounds more like a Norwegian Morricone than Sibelius), and rock music, to create -- if this is possible -- a newly textured instrumental music that is free of all trappings. Nowhere is this more evident than on \"Out of This World (Sinfonietta),\" where the post-bop jazz in the first movement bleeds into a place where Darling's cello is allowed to break free of its traditional constraints and climb to the heavens along with Rypdal's burning guitar lines, which come as much from Jimi Hendrix as from John McLaughlin. About halfway through, the work moves into the territory of free improvising, before Rypdal brings it back to a processional, theatrical close. What follows are gorgeous, textured ambient balladry, precise salon music, and more free jazz/rock workouts. Skywards is Rypdal's most openly schizophrenic yet satisfyingly ambitious work in many years.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>Doug Sahm began his solo career in 1972, after the Sir Douglas Quintet finished its contract with Smash/Mercury and after Atlantic Records co-owner/producer Jerry Wexler convinced him to sign to his label. Wexler gave the Texas maverick the chance to cut a star-studded, big-budget album, shuffling him off to New York where Wexler and Arif Mardin helmed a series of sessions with an ever-revolving cast of musicians featuring Bob Dylan, Dr. John, David \"Fathead\" Newman, David Bromberg, and Flaco Jimenez, in addition to such Sir Doug stalwarts as Augie Meyers and the rhythm section of bassist Jack Barber and drummer George Rains (all but the latter were in the last incarnation of the Quintet, raising the question of whether the group was indeed finished or not, but such is the nature of Sahm's discography). This group cut a lot of material, which was whittled down to the 12-track album Doug Sahm and Band, released in early 1973. At the time, the record received a push from the label and was generally disparaged because of those very all-stars on whose back it was sold, but the years have been kind indeed to the album, and it stands among Sahm's best. Indeed, the heart of the album is not at all far removed from those latter-day Sir Douglas Quintet albums on Mercury, which isn't much of a stretch since Sahm never really strayed from his signature blend of rock & roll, blues, country, and Tejano, but the bigger band and bigger production give the music a different feel -- one that's as loose as the best Quintet material, but off-handedly accomplished and slyly freewheeling. Original reviews noted that there was an overtly country direction on And Band, but that's not really true on an album that has Western swing and rambling country-rock like \"Blues Stay Away from Me\" and the anthemic \"(Is Anybody Going To) San Antone\" jutting up against pure blues in \"Your Friends\" and \"Papa Ain't Salty,\" let alone loose-limbed rockers like \"Dealer's Blues\" and \"I Get Off\" or the skipping Tejano \"Poison Love,\" fueled by Jimenez's addictive accordion.</p><p>These are all convincing arguments that the larger band allowed Sahm to indulge in all of his passions, to the extent of devoting full tracks to each of his favorite sounds -- something that was a bit different than the Quintet records, which usually mixed it all up so it was impossible to tell where one influence ended and another began. That's still true on And Band -- for instance, witness the brilliant cover of Willie Nelson's \"Me and Paul,\" a country song goosed by soulful horns and delivered in a delirious drawl from Sir Doug -- but much of the album finds that signature Sahm sprawl being punctuated by style-specific detours where Sahm seizes the opportunity to stretch out as much as his guests seize the opportunity to jam with this American musical visionary. These are all characteristics of a jam session, which these sessions essentially were -- after all, on this album he only penned three out of the 12 songs -- but relying on covers also points out how Doug Sahm sounds so much like himself, he makes other people's tunes sound as if he wrote them himself. Again, that's something that was true throughout his career, but here it is in sharper relief than most of his records due to the nature of the sessions. And while it's arguable whether this is better than latter-day Sir Douglas Quintet albums -- or such mid-'70s records as Groover's Paradise or Texas Rock for Country Rollers for that matter -- there's no question that this is music that is vividly, excitedly alive and captures Sahm at a peak. It's pretty much irresistible.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"2\" data-line-end=\"3\"><a id=\"A1_Is_Anybody_Going_To_San_Antone_2\"></a>A1 (Is Anybody Going To) San Antone</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"4\" data-line-end=\"8\">Fiddle [Twin] — Doug Sahm, Ken Kosek*.<br/>Steel Guitar — Charlie Owens*.<br/>Vocals — Bob Dylan, Doug Sahm.<br/>Written-By — Dave Kirby*, Glen Martin*.<br/></p><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"9\" data-line-end=\"10\"><a id=\"A2_Its_Gonna_Be_Easy_9\"></a>A2 It’s Gonna Be Easy</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"11\" data-line-end=\"15\">Backing Vocals — Doug*, Jack*.<br/>Lead Vocals — Atwood*, Doug*.<br/>Steel Guitar — Charlie Owens*.<br/>Written-By — Atwood Allen.<br/></p><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"16\" data-line-end=\"17\"><a id=\"A3_Your_Friends_16\"></a>A3 Your Friends</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"18\" data-line-end=\"24\">Baritone Saxophone — Willie Bridges.<br/>Electric Piano — Arif Mardin.<br/>Lead Guitar — Doug Sahm.<br/>Tenor Saxophone — Fathead*.<br/>Trumpet — Wayne Jackson.<br/>Written-By — Deadric Malone.<br/></p><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"25\" data-line-end=\"26\"><a id=\"A4_Poison_Love_25\"></a>A4 Poison Love</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"27\" data-line-end=\"34\">Accordion — Flaco Jimenez.<br/>Dobro — David Bromberg.<br/>Harmony Vocals — Atwood*.<br/>Lead Vocals — Doug*.<br/>Mandolin — Andy Statman.<br/>Piano — Augie Meyer*.<br/>Written-By — Elmer Laird.<br/></p><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"35\" data-line-end=\"36\"><a id=\"A5_Wallflower_35\"></a>A5 Wallflower</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"37\" data-line-end=\"42\">Dobro — Dave Bromberg*.<br/>Lead Guitar — Bob Dylan.<br/>Organ — Dr. John.<br/>Vocals — Bob*, Doug*.<br/>Written-By — Bob Dylan.<br/></p><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"43\" data-line-end=\"44\"><a id=\"A6_Dealers_Blues_43\"></a>A6 Dealer’s Blues</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"45\" data-line-end=\"49\">Horns — Jack Walrath, Martin Fierro, Mel Martin.<br/>Lead Guitar — Doug Sahm.<br/>Soloist, Tenor Saxophone — David “Fathead” Newman.<br/>Written-By — Doug Sahm.<br/></p><h4 class=\"code-line\" data-line-start=\"50\" data-line-end=\"51\"><a id=\"B1_Faded_Love_50\"></a>B1 Faded Love</h4><p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"52\" data-line-end=\"56\">Fiddle [Twin] — Doug Sahm, Ken Kosek*.<br/>Steel Guitar — Charlie*.<br/>Vocals — Atwood*, Doug*.<br/>Written-By — B.

When one considers just how different Santana, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, and the Grateful Dead sounded, it becomes obvious just how much it was encouraged. In the mid-'90s, an album as eclectic as Abraxas would be considered a marketing exec's worst nightmare. But at the dawn of the 1970s, this unorthodox mix of rock, jazz, salsa, and blues proved quite successful. Whether adding rock elements to salsa king Tito Puente's \"Oye Como Va,\" embracing instrumental jazz-rock on \"Incident at Neshabur\" and \"Samba Pa Ti,\" or tackling moody blues-rock on Fleetwood Mac's \"Black Magic Woman,\" the band keeps things unpredictable yet cohesive. Many of the Santana albums that came out in the '70s are worth acquiring, but for novices, Abraxas is an excellent place to start.</p>&mdash; <b>Alex Henderson</b>"

		"review": "<p>The 2003 remastered, expanded reissue of the now-legendary collaboration between guitarists Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin can hardly be overstated. A hopelessly misunderstood record in its time by Santana fans -- they were still reeling from the radical direction shift toward jazz on Caravanserai and praying it was an aberration -- it was greeted by Santana devotees with hostility, contrasted with kindness from major-league critics like Robert Palmer. To hear this recording in the context of not only Carlos Santana's development as a guitarist, but as the logical extension of the music of John Coltrane and Miles Davis influencing rock musicians -- McLaughlin, of course, was a former Davis sideman -- this extension makes perfect sense in the post-Sonic Youth, post-rock era. With the exception of Coltrane's \"Naima\" and McLaughlin's \"Meditation,\" this album consists of merely three extended guitar jams played on the spiritual ecstasy tip -- both men were devotees of guru Shri Chinmoy at the time. The assembled band included members of Santana's band and the Mahavishnu Orchestra in Michael Shrieve, Billy Cobham, Doug Rauch, Armando Peraza, Jan Hammer (playing drums!), and Don Alias. But it is the presence of the revolutionary jazz organist Larry Young -- a colleague of McLaughlin's in Tony Williams' Lifetime band -- that makes the entire project gel. He stands as the great communicator harmonically between the two very different guitarists whose ideas contrasted enough to complement one another in the context of Young's aggressive approach to keep the entire proceeding in the air. In the acknowledgement section of Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme,\" which opens the album -- and on its alternate take added here -- Young creates a channel between Santana's riotous, transcendent, melodic runs, and McLaughlin's rapid-fire machine-gun riffing. Young' double-handed striated chord voicings offered enough for both men to chew on, leaving free-ranging territory for percussive effects to drive the tracks from underneath. Check \"Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord,\" which was musically inspired by Bobby Womack's \"Breezing,\" and dynamically foreshadowed by Pharoah Sanders' read of it, or the insanely knotty yet intervallically transcendent \"The Life Divine,\" for the manner in which Young's organ actually speaks both languages simultaneously. On this \"remaster,\" one can hear Young's real contribution to the sessions for the first time: he is mixed much higher here allowing all of his otherworldly chords, syncopations, and harmonic inventions to be heard at their proper weights. Young is the person who makes the room for the deep spirituality inherent in these sessions to be grasped for what it is: the interplay of two men who were not merely paying tribute to Coltrane, but trying to take his ideas about going beyond the realm of Western music to communicate with the language of the heart as it united with the cosmos. After three decades, Love Devotion Surrender still sounds completely radical and stunningly, movingly beautiful.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>While Ron Sexsmith has had little problem establishing his identity as a songwriter with the warm, compassionate intelligence of his lyrics, as a recording artist he's been a bit harder to pin down. After escaping the tape-loop jungle of Mitchell Froom's production on his first three major-label albums, Sexsmith has seen his music matched with the roots-oriented pop approach of <I>Blue Boy</I> and the subtle electronic textures of <I>Cobblestone Runway</I>, each successful but in decidedly different ways. At first listen, Sexsmith's sixth album, <I>Retriever</I>, sounds like an attempt to move back to the style of <I>Other Songs</I> or <I>Whereabouts</I>, but without the production excesses of those sessions; many of themelodies boast '60s-influenced pop hooks, and Martin Terefe's production subtly reinforces the Beatlesque qualities of the music, with occasional side trips into the land of '70s singer/songwriters (\"Whatever It Takes\" could almost pass for a lost Bill Withers track). But the results have a more open and organic feel than Froom's thematically similar work, employing real strings and less cluttered arrangements, and Sexsmith sounds quite comfortable in these surroundings.</p><p>While Sexsmith sounded decidedly awkward and self-conscious as a singer on his early albums, he's grown into a vocalist who delivers his material with a genuine and compelling commitment on his recent albums, and <I>Retriever</I> sounds like his most confident and accomplished set to date. And as a writer, Sexsmith is still gloriously one of a kind, a man who can write about love without sounding either cloying or bitter, and can document both the bright and dark sides of life with honesty, heart, and clear perception. Most songwriters could go their whole careers without penning a song as strong as \"How on Earth,\" \"Imaginary Friends,\" or \"For the Driver,\" and those are just three of the highpoints on <I>Retriever</I>; if you know Sexsmith's work, then you already have a good idea of how good this album is, and if you don't, this is a fine place to get acquainted.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p><hr/><p>Like Freedy Johnston and Aimee Mann, Ron Sexsmith is one of those below-the-radar singer/songwriters     trumpeted by critics and musicians indignant that the songwriter isn't a star already, dammit.  Despite     high-profile admirers like Elvis Costello and six highly praised albums on three labels, Sexsmith's career     has maintained a steady trajectory, neither sinking toward Johnston's obscurity nor rising to Mann's cult     status. Retriever is his sixth album in a not quite a decade, and as with each of its predecessors, it's     shot through with a shaky optimism to match Sexsmith's boyish looks, light lyrical touch, and charmingly     warbly voice.  The title suggests someone dumbly loyal, either blessed or afflicted with a canine devotion     to a lover, to friends, or to certain romantic ideas about life.  In keeping with recent albums like     Cobblestone Runway and Blue Boy, producer Martin Terefe sets Sexsmith's voice against a     lively full-band sound and bolsters it with dream-weaver string flourishes on \"Whatever It Takes\" and \"Not     About to Lose\".  Generally, the music recalls Jon Brion's work with Mann and Fiona Apple, but is never so     garishly ostentatious.          As usual, Retriever also features Sexsmith's studiously plainspoken lyrics, which work hard to reveal     a great deal without being stylistically idiosyncratic; he truly wants everyone to sing along to these songs     about \"happiness\" and \"sadness.\"  \"Hard Bargain\" is a surprisingly well-adjusted love song: \"How's a guy     supposed to fail/ With someone like you around?\"  If he didn't sound so convincingly smitten, you might     think this was a parody of those dark ballads so full of self-loathing and self-absorption.  And when he     sings lines like, \"I've seen tomorrow in her eyes,\" or, \"Dreams come true in heaven all the time,\" not only     is he keeping a straight, wholly unironic face, but he's almost self-consciously risking cornball sentiment.     He barely skirts this pitfall, but his willingness to tread that line creates an awkward vulnerability that     only makes him more endearing.          On the other hand, can someone be too earnest?  The same indefatigable hopefulness that sets Sexsmith apart     also makes Retriever a bit tiresome.  He instills every song with such gentle, unaffected feeling that     Retriever becomes monochromatic, lacking emotional variety.  A smirk or even a knowing one-liner     would have shaded that directness with some welcome humor.          The overearnestness takes the bite out of more topical songs like \"From Now On\" and \"Wishing Wells\", where     his uncomplicated lyrics become a liability.  Propelled by Ed Harcourt's piano, \"From Now On\" could even     make a rousing theme song for John Kerry's campaign-- especially if the musician-turned-candidate performed     it himself.  The lyrics, however, are too obvious and hammer-blunt: \"We live in times/ Where choice is frowned     upon/ Afraid to even raise/ Our voice in song.\"          But that same song contains another few lines-- \"They're in the business of panic and control/ We're in the     business of the heart and the soul\"--that bristle with heart-on-sleeve righteousness.  Sexsmith is always a     little more complicated than he appears, and his quiet perseverance-- through each song as well as over the     course of his career-- carries its own intricate poetry that belies the understatement of his persona.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

The Best of Wayne Shorter, which was released in 1998 within a series of other Blue Note best-ofs that were coming out at the time, is adequate, but with only one disc it's hard to cover any ground with a guy who's recorded around a dozen top-notch records as a leader for Blue Note, and then appeared on scores of others -- and that's where this collection wins. The second disc consists of appearances he made alongside such greats as Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, and Freddie Hubbard. Perhaps a Blue Note Wayne Shorter box set is in order? At any rate, \"Speak No Evil,\" \"Footprints,\" \"Witch Hunt,\" and \"Nefertiti\" prove to highlight Wayne Shorter's astounding career and in turn show off jazz composition in general -- as Shorter stands as the one of the genre's best songwriters. Recommended as a springboard into the full-length discs these tracks are culled from, The Classic Blue Note Recordings of Wayne Shorter hits the mark.</p>&mdash; <b>Jack LV Isles</b>"

That, however, didn't mean he couldn't make a great album, so Elektra matched the songsmith with producer Peter K. Siegel and turned them loose in the studio. With a shoestring budget, the two men gathered a handful of fine musicians — including guitarist David Bromberg, violinist Richard Greene, and steel guitarist Weldon Myrick — to record ten Siebel originals quickly. Despite, or because of, the small budget and lack of time, Siebel and company crafted an incredible record that still sounds vibrant 30 years after the fact. Woodsmoke and Oranges begins with three gems, the up-tempo \"She Made Me Lose My Blues,\" the jazzy \"Miss Cherry Lane,\" and the road song \"Nashville Again.\" Everything works in harmony here — Siebel's songs, the vocals, and the sparkling, multi-layered arrangements. In fact, throughout the album, the arrangements seem to push the singer forward to deliver taut, heartfelt performances. The slower ballads equal the upbeat material, with nods going to \"Louise\" and \"Long Afternoons.\" Like John Prine, Siebel is a singer/songwriter who has serious things on his mind, but doesn't forget to write memorable melodies to accompany the words. Although he'd never outdo his work on Woodsmoke and Oranges, few artists ever craft an album this good.</P><P>— <B>Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr.</B></P><HR><p>The first record may have drawn listeners for the opportunity to hear Siebel originals of songs they knew from elsewhere. This record does not have that same kind of pull but is every bit as good. His strong sense of melody and storytelling style paved the way for such current songwriters as Butch Hancock and Robert Earl Keen.</p>&mdash; <b>Jim Worbois</b>"

		"review": "<p>If any musical justification were needed for the breakup of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, it could be found on this striking collection, Paul Simon's post-split debut. From the opening cut, \"Mother and Child Reunion\" (a Top Ten hit), Simon, who had snuck several subtle musical explorations into the generally conservative S&amp;G sound, broke free, heralding the rise of reggae with an exuberant track recorded in Jamaica for a song about death. From there, it was off to Paris for a track in South American style and a rambling story of a fisherman's son, \"Duncan\" (which made the singles chart). But most of the album had a low-key feel, with Simon on acoustic guitar backed by only a few trusted associates (among them Joe Osborn, Larry Knechtel, David Spinozza, Mike Manieri, Ron Carter, and Hal Blaine, along with such guests as Stefan Grossman, Airto Moreira, and Stephane Grappelli), singing a group of informal, intimate, funny, and closely observed songs (among them the lively Top 40 hit \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\"). It was miles removed from the big, stately ballad style of Bridge Over Troubled Water and signaled that Simon was a versatile songwriter as well as an expressive singer with a much broader range of musical interests than he had previously demonstrated. You didn't miss Art Garfunkel on Paul Simon, not only because Simon didn't write Garfunkel-like showcases for himself, but because the songs he did write showed off his own, more varied musical strengths. [In 2004, Warner Strategic Marketing reissued Simon's studio albums as remastered editions with bonus tracks, packaged in a cardboard digipack. The remastering on Paul Simon is particularly startling &mdash; it's crystal clear, yet warm, easily the best-sounding version of this album yet pressed. The three previously unreleased bonus tracks on Paul Simon are also revelatory, containing a demo of \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" with a different verse and a radically different version of \"Duncan,\" which contains a different narrative than the final version. The third bonus track is an alternate version of \"Paranoia Blues\" that is more relaxed and laid-back than the album version.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>It's easy to write off <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i> as one of two things — Sly Stone's disgusted social commentary or the beginning of his slow descent into addiction. It's both of these things, of course, but pigeonholing it as either winds up dismissing the album as a whole, since it is so bloody hard to categorize. What's certain is that Riot is unlike any of Sly & the Family Stone's other albums, stripped of the effervescence that flowed through even such politically aware records as <i>Stand!</i>. This is idealism soured, as hope is slowly replaced by cynicism, joy by skepticism, enthusiasm by weariness, sex by pornography, thrills by narcotics. Joy isn't entirely gone — it creeps through the cracks every once and awhile and, more disturbing, Sly revels in his stoned decadence. What makes Riot so remarkable is that it's hard not to get drawn in with him, as you're seduced by the narcotic grooves, seductive vocals slurs, leering electric pianos, and crawling guitars. As the themes surface, it's hard not to nod in agreement, but it's a junkie nod, induced by the comforting coma of the music. And damn if this music isn't funk at its deepest and most impenetrable — this is dense music, nearly impenetrable, but not from its deep grooves, but its utter weariness. Sly's songwriting remains remarkably sharp, but only when he wants to write — the foreboding opener \"Luv N' Haight,\" the scarily resigned \"Family Affair,\" the cracked cynical blues \"Time,\" and \"(You Caught Me) Smilin'.\" Ultimately, the music is the message and while it's dark music, it's not alienating — it's seductive despair, and that's the scariest thing about it. &mdash;<b></b>"

		"review": "<p>There was no shortage of good psychedelic albums emerging from England in 1967-1968, but Ogden's Nut Gone Flake is special even within their ranks. The Small Faces had already shown a surprising adaptability to psychedelia with the single \"Itchycoo Park\" and much of their other 1967 output, but Ogden's Nut Gone Flake pretty much ripped the envelope. British bands had an unusual approach to psychedelia from the get-go, often preferring to assume different musical \"personae\" on their albums, either feigning actual \"roles\" in the context of a variety show (as on the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album), or simply as storytellers in the manner of the Pretty Things on S.F. Sorrow, or actor/performers as on the Who's Tommy. The Small Faces tried a little bit of all of these approaches on Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, but they never softened their sound. Side one's material, in particular, would not have been out of place on any other Small Faces release -- \"Afterglow (Of Your Love)\" and \"Rene\" both have a pounding beat from Kenny Jones, and Ian McLagan's surging organ drives the former while his economical piano accompaniment embellishes the latter; and Steve Marriott's crunching guitar highlights \"Song of a Baker.\" Marriott singing has him assuming two distinct \"roles,\" neither unfamiliar -- the Cockney upstart on \"Rene\" and \"Lazy Sunday,\" and the diminutive soul-shouter on \"Afterglow (of Your Love)\" and \"Song of a Baker.\" Some of side two's production is more elaborate, with overdubbed harps and light orchestration here and there, and an array of more ambitious songs, all linked by a narration by comic dialect expert Stanley Unwin, about a character called \"Happiness Stan.\" The core of the sound, however, is found in the pounding \"Rollin' Over,\" which became a highlight of the group's stage act during its final days -- the song seems lean and mean with a mix in which Ronnie Lane's bass is louder than the overdubbed horns. Even \"Mad John,\" which derives from folk influences, has a refreshingly muscular sound on its acoustic instruments. Overall, this was the ballsiest-sounding piece of full-length psychedelia to come out of England, and it rode the number one spot on the U.K. charts for six weeks in 1968, though not without some controversy surrounding advertisements by Immediate Records that parodied the Lord's Prayer. Still, Ogdens was the group's crowning achievement -- it had even been Marriott's hope to do a stage presentation of Ogden's Nut Gone Flake, though a television special might've been more in order. As with most Immediate Records releases, it has gone through multiple reissue cycles on vinyl and CD; the original LP came in a circular sleeve in keeping with the design of the cover, and was reissued in a more convention jacket during the 1970s and early '80s. Most of the CD versions until the 1990s were, in keeping with the poor state of the Immediate Records tape library, substandard in sound, but since 1994 or so there has been a succession of good-sounding digital remasterings.</p>&mdash; <b>Bruce Eder</b>"

		"review": "<p>While <i>Gish</i> had placed the Smashing Pumpkins on the \"most promising artist\" list for many, troubles were threatening to break the band apart. Singer/guitarist/leader Billy Corgan was battling a severe case of writer's block and was in a deep state of depression brought on by a relationship in turmoil; drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was addicted to hard drugs; and bassist D'Arcy and guitarist James Iha severed their romantic relationship. The sessions for their sophomore effort, <i>Siamese Dream</i>, were wrought with friction -- Corgan eventually played almost all the instruments himself (except for percussion). Some say strife and tension produces the best music, and it certainly helped make <i>Siamese Dream</i> one of the finest alt-rock albums of all time.</p> <p>Instead of following Nirvana's punk rock route, <i>Siamese Dream</i> went in the opposite direction -- guitar solos galore, layered walls of sound courtesy of the album's producers (Butch Vig and Corgan), extended compositions that bordered on prog rock, plus often reflective and heartfelt lyrics. The four tracks that were selected as singles became alternative radio standards -- the anthems \"Cherub Rock,\" \"Today,\" and \"Rocket,\" plus the symphonic ballad \"Disarm\" -- but as a whole, <i>Siamese Dream</i> proved to be an incredibly consistent album. Such compositions as the red-hot rockers \"Quiet\" and \"Geek U.S.A.\" were standouts, as were the epics \"Hummer,\" \"Soma,\" and \"Silverfuck,\" plus the soothing sounds of \"Mayonaise,\" \"Spaceboy,\" and \"Luna.\" After the difficult recording sessions, Corgan stated publicly that if <i>Siamese Dream</i> didn't achieve breakthrough success, he would end the band. He didn't have to worry for long -- the album debuted in the Billboard Top Ten and sold more than four million copies in three years. <i>Siamese Dream</i> stands alongside Nevermind and Superunknown as one of the decade's finest (and most influential) rock albums.</p>&mdash; <b>Greg Prato</b>"

		"review": "<p>Billy Corgan hasn't done a very good job speaking on his own behalf over the past decade, so let me feed him a line from the Greek philosopher Pittacus that would make a much better case for his legacy: \"The measure of a man is what he does with power.\" In 1995, nearly every other band at Smashing Pumpkins' level was in some way turning its back on its audience: Pearl Jam had started their principled retreat from the spotlight; U2 and R.E.M. were deep within their stagiest, most ironic phases and making their least satisfying music to date; Rivers Cuomo was well on his way towards making Pinkerton; Metallica discovered nail polish; and, of course, Kurt Cobain gave up on life itself. On a much smaller level, even Corgan's eternal rival Steve Malkmus had just released Wowee Zowee, a record whose sloppy sprawl was taken by Rolling Stone as proof that \"Pavement are simply afraid to succeed.\"</p><p>Given this mid-decade valley, it's understandable that the 2xCD Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness would be sneered at as self-indulgent. The Smashing Pumpkins hadn't made their appearance at Hullabalooza yet, so many were unaware the band had a sense of humor*.* Still, their reputation was played for laughs. But Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness turned out to be one of the most generous records of the decade. During a time when rock heroes were hard to come by, Smashing Pumpkins took it upon themselves to make a record that only teenagers could love and for many it was the only one they needed.</p><p>I suppose it's worth mentioning I was 15 when Mellon Collie came out and I would've told you at the time it was my favorite album ever made. Finally, I thought, here was our White Album, Physical Graffiti, or The Wall, but we could watch its legend being constructed in real time without all the received wisdom. It's true, a double album reeks of 70s-style excess that tries to edify its creators. It was meant as Smashing Pumpkins' monument to itself. But in the case of Mellon Collie, it was the only format that could contain the songwriting streak Corgan was going through at the time. Anything shorter would've done his fans a disservice.</p><p>This is not an exaggeration. Cull the 14 best tracks from the concurrently recorded The Aeroplane Flies High singles collection and you either have the fourth best Smashing Pumpkins album (behind the perpetually underrated Adore, ahead of Pisces Iscariot) or a strong third disc that would've made Mellon Collie the greatest triple-LP ever made. What becomes more obvious with time is that Mellon Collie, unlike its most common comparison The Wall, has no conceptual framework. There is no plot, almost no filler, and the organization of its two discs is iffy at best: The second song on the seemingly chronological first disc Dawn to Dusk is \"Tonight, Tonight\", while disc two, Twilight to Starlight, contains all of the ugliest metal songs. So Mellon Collie is a Smashing Pumpkins record that just so happens to be 28 songs in length, stunning in both its stylistic range and overall excellence.</p><p>This is perhaps the only Smashing Pumpkins record where they acted like an actual band rather than Corgan and his resentful charges. It's hard to pinpoint where the influence of James Iha or D'Arcy came into play (not so with the phenomenal drumming of Jimmy Chamberlin), but with the oversight of producers Flood and Alan Moulder, Mellon Collie was developed through protracted jam sessions and personal interplay. Siamese Dream, for all of its symphonic grandeur, was a fairly standard rock album and a solitary one-- nearly all of the guitar and bass parts were rumored to have been performed by Corgan himself. Meanwhile, Mellon Collie indulges in styles more associated with hermetic artists-- ornate chamber-pop (\"Cupid De Locke\"), mumbly acoustic confessionals (\"Stumbleine\"), and synthesized nocturnes (mostly everything after \"X.Y.U.\"). And it does so while feeling like the work of four people in a room.</p><p>Mellon Collie's remarkable breadth is the best indication of Corgan's ability to let loose. You could pick five songs at random and still end up with a diverse batch of singles that would make a case for Smashing Pumpkins being the most stylistically malleable multi-platinum act of the 90s. Maybe it wouldn't sell as many copies, but picture an alternate universe where heavy rotation met the joyous, mechanized grind of \"Love\", \"In the Arms of Sleep\"'s unabashed antiquated romanticism, the Prince-like electro-ballad \"Beautiful\", \"Muzzle\"'s stadium-status affirmations, or the throttling metal of \"Bodies\".</p><p>The ubiquity of the five songs that did become singles overshadows just how idiosyncratic and distinct they were in the scope of 1995. Has there been anything like \"Tonight, Tonight\" since? Orchestral strings typically signify weepy balladry or compositional pretension in rock music, not wonderful, lovestruck propulsion. While \"Tonight, Tonight\" is now inseparable from its Le Voyage dans la lune-inspired video, that the music existed without its guidance only stresses the Pumpkins' sonic creativity. \"Thirty-Three\" was the final and least heralded of the singles-- where on alt-rock radio was there room for a slowpoke, time-signature shifting country song with phased slide guitars and shuffling drum machines?</p><p>\"Zero\" and \"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\" are the ones that riled up the older folks and, yes, the lyrics are pissy and juvenile and fairly embarrassing. That said, they're far more interesting from a sonic perspective than they're often given credit for. They're the songs where Flood's digitized production fits better than the saturated, analog warmth Butch Vig lent to Siamese Dream. They're basically new wave performed as pop-metal.</p><p>And of course, there's \"1979\", the one everybody can agree on. On a record that reveled in 70s prog and pomp without being restricted to it, it sounds futuristic. And while just as youth-obsessed as everything else here, it's one of the few times where high school sounds like something that can be remembered fondly. Corgan loves to stress how it was the last song to make the record, and while its chorus does have an effortless charge embodying the \"urgency of now,\" it's the only Mellon Collie song that functions best as nostalgia. That reading is no doubt abetted by another fantastic video, but while \"1979\" is an unimpeachable song, the rush to praise it as an outlier does its surroundings a tremendous disservice. While Mellon Collie is the realization of all Billy Corgan's ambitions, most of the criticisms surround the lyrics for not being as personal as those on the tortured Siamese Dream. It's this way by design.</p><p>The terms \"sad machines\" and \"teen machines\" are interchangeably used during \"Here Is No Why\", a pep talk to the outwardly sullen mopes who Corgan urges to break free of either and ascend like its heroic guitar solo. \"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\" is notorious for its chorus, but teen angst doesn't fight fair; you need some seriously heavy ammo to resist it. The mudslide of distortion that ushers in its bridge leads towards two minutes of the most viscerally exciting music that Smashing Pumpkins produced. Then immediately after, the mournful \"To Forgive\" devastates with a personal detail that gives Corgan credibility in all of this: \"And I remember my birthdays/ Empty party afternoons.\" This is the kind of youthful, inexplicable emotional whiplash that can result in an immolating hatebomb called \"Fuck You (An Ode to No One)\" being followed by a giddy proclamation that \"love solves everything.\" It's clearly not a mature way of dealing with life, but that's only a problem if you somehow believe Mellon Collie isn't meant as rock 'n' roll fantasy. When Corgan declares \"I know that I was meant for this world\" during \"Muzzle\", it's your happy ending.</p><p>So, yes, most people who have developed a meaningful relationship with Mellon Collie did so in their youth. The question is whether you can get anything new from this in 2012. As with all of the Smashing Pumpkins reissues, Mellon Collie is giving: the Deluxe boxed set justifies its sticker shock by containing \"re-imagined cover art, velvet-lined disc holder and decoupage kit for creating your own scenes from the Mellon Collie Universe,\" which is everything you'd imagine and thensome. There are an extra 64 tracks and only a few of them appeared on The Aeroplane Flies High, though most of these inclusions are demos or alternate takes, the sort of thing that should only be listened to multiple times by people who are being paid to do so, i.e., music critics and Flood.</p><p>But there is a way of hearing the same album differently as you refract it through your own experiences. \"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\" is rumored to have contained 70 guitar tracks; it's a wedding vow punctuated by Corgan snarling \"youth is wasted on the young.\" This isn't meant to negate the intent of the 90 minutes that preceded it, it's a reminder of how Mellon Collie can communicate different things to someone who's 30 as opposed to 15. Revisiting it can feel like leafing through a high school yearbook-- not necessarily your own, just somebody's. And there's solace in how, for all of the navel-gazing that went on, the ridiculousness of it all somehow escapes you. What you wore, how you spoke, what you felt not so much seeming normal as just the way it is. You look at each person, thinking that they might hope to achieve the self-actualization promised by \"Muzzle\", to lose themselves in another person in the manner described by \"Beautiful\" or \"In the Arms of Sleep\", or to embrace their own awkwardness as a rallying cry like \"We Only Come Out at Night\". Those events were all right around the corner, as they are for just about anybody growing up, but when you're locked up in your room listening to Mellon Collie for hours on end, they seem as distant and fantastical as the album cover. When Corgan sings \"believe in me\" during \"Tonight, Tonight\", you don't have much of a choice if you want to escape.</p><p>I'd like to say \"they don't make 'em like this anymore,\" which is true if you want to talk about rock bands who make double-LPs that sell 10 million copies thanks in part to lavish videos that air constantly on MTV. They do make 'em like this, in spirit, albeit very rarely-- 2012 appears to be just as hostile as 1995 was towards embracing the life-altering possibilities of classic rock or pursuing actual populism. It's no wonder Corgan is so agitated about the state of rock music these days, since his critics won. But every now again, there will be something like M83's Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming and Japandroids' Celebration Rock-- that get there in their own way and express what the Pumpkins did on \"Tonight, Tonight\", that \"the impossible is possible tonight,\" as in right now. They have little to do with Mellon Collie except that they sacrifice being cool to show a deep respect for the way teenagers interact with music. When the world is a vampire, you don't want history lessons or a list of influences, you want fucking magic. You don't want lifestyle music, you don't want Our Band Could Be Your Life. You want music that you can live inside. Damn right Smashing Pumpkins shot for the moon on Mellon Collie, but only because they wanted to give you the sun and the stars.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Ian Cohen, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>A year before his major-label debut, XO, was released, it seemed unlikely that Elliott Smith would even be on a major, let alone having his record be one of the more anticipated releases of 1998. He had certainly earned a great deal of critical respect with his low-key, acoustic indie records and was emerging as a respected songwriter, but he hadn't made much of an impression outside of journalists, record collectors, and indie rockers. An Oscar nomination can change things, however. \"Miss Misery,\" one of Smith's elegantly elegiac songs for Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting, unexpectedly earned an Academy Award nomination, and he was immediately thrust into the spotlight. He was reluctant to embrace instant celebrity, yet he didn't refuse a contract with DreamWorks, and he didn't shy away from turning XO into a glorious fruition of his talents. Smith's songs remain intensely introspective, yet the lush, Beatlesque production provides a terrifically charming counterpoint. His sweetly dark melodies are vividly brought to life with the detailed arrangements, and they sell Smith's tormented songs -- it's easy to get caught up in the tunes and the sound of the record, then realize later what the songs are actually about. That's a sign of a good craftsman, and XO proves that not only can Elliott Smith craft a song, but he knows how to make an alluring pop record as well.</p>&mdash;<b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

There was an attempt to keep a demarcation between the two though, each track being assigned to one name or the other, with clear instrumentation and genre differences. Instead of this diversity being a strength, as it was on Milesago, it becomes jarring. The Murtceps numbers are generally straight-forward boogie numbers (with apparently an ear to the success of Daddy Cool - the guitar riff in \"Indelible Shuffle\" is very reminiscent of their \"Hi Honey Ho\"), with keyboards restricted to piano. The Spectrum numbers are ponderous mid-tempo numbers with a fuller range of keyboard sounds (courtesy new member John Mills), including the first use of synthesizers, but little of the fire we used to get from Lee Neale - or from anyone else in the band. The best number on the album is the one Murtceps number to break the genre straightjacket imposed on each identity, \"Real Meanie\". The best of the Spectrum numbers are \"I Think I Even Missed The Station\" and Ray Arnott's grooving \"It Would Be Nice\". \"Essay In Paranoia\", apparently a stage favourite at the time, is the most overtly proggy in it's multiple sections and use of synthesizer.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Simon - Progarchives.com</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Bruce Springsteen's make-or-break third album represented a sonic leap from his first two, which had been made for modest sums at a suburban studio; Born to Run was cut on a superstar budget, mostly at the Record Plant in New York. Springsteen's backup band had changed, with his two virtuoso players, keyboardist David Sancious and drummer Vini Lopez, replaced by the professional but less flashy Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg. The result was a full, highly produced sound that contained elements of Phil Spector's melodramatic work of the 1960s. Layers of guitar, layers of echo on the vocals, lots of keyboards, thunderous drums -- Born to Run had a big sound, and Springsteen wrote big songs to match it. The overall theme of the album was similar to that of The E Street Shuffle; Springsteen was describing, and saying farewell to, a romanticized teenage street life. But where he had been affectionate, even humorous before, he was becoming increasingly bitter. If Springsteen had celebrated his dead-end kids on his first album and viewed them nostalgically on his second, on his third he seemed to despise their failure, perhaps because he was beginning to fear he was trapped himself. Nevertheless, he now felt removed, composing an updated West Side Story with spectacular music that owed more to Bernstein than to Berry. To call Born to Run overblown is to miss the point; Springsteen's precise intention is to blow things up, both in the sense of expanding them to gargantuan size and of exploding them. If The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was an accidental miracle, Born to Run was an intentional masterpiece. It declared its own greatness with songs and a sound that lived up to Springsteen's promise, and though some thought it took itself too seriously, many found that exalting.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>There is such a strange feeling to be writing this, listening intently to the remastered version of Bruce Springsteen's breakthrough 1975 recording Born to Run, as if it hadn't happened at all but was happening in this moment. To look back at pop history as something of an oracle through the glass on its reverse side is always tricky. There was a lot at stake in rock & roll in those days. David Bowie was about to move into his next incarnation after the death of Ziggy Stardust and into his Berlin period; Queen was moving away from hard rock and into its own identity as well; Roxy Music was about to crack it; the J. Geils Band was shattering houses everywhere with its brand of roots blues and barroom rock; T. Rex was almost absent on American shores, and Kiss had stepped in mightily and faultily to cash in on it all. Meanwhile, the Faces were history, and the New York Dolls were disintegrating; Aerosmith were fighting each other, Led Zep were the power and glory of hard rock; Iggy was lost to addiction; Marvin Gaye and Motown were turning into something else, as was the Philly soul sound, mutating into the next phase of funk, and eventually disco. P-Funk were tearing it up musically and on the road, but not to many white audiences; Marvin Gaye was working on I Want You; Leroy Hutson was releasing the best albums of his career but to little notice of rock audiences; Miles was in retirement, and only Grover Washington was carrying the soul-jazz banner into the future with Mister Magic and Feels So Good. The Rolling Stones were doing their thing, but they were the Rolling Stones. And then the dread Yes and Jethro Tull and Emerson, Lake & Palmer were ruining rock for another five years. The time was right for something to happen, and happen it did. Springsteen and his E Street Band, armed with a slew of session players, came ambling out of the New Jersey shadows, having no idea what they were doing with a brand of guttersnipe, gritty rock infused with soul, R&B, garage band aesthetics, and a stage show that challenged even Mott the Hoople's, to conquer the world whether they wanted to or not.</p><p>In its present incarnation, finally remastered to full satisfaction of fans in the post-LP era, Born to Run sounds as startling, dynamic, and desperate as it did in 1975. The songs roar once more with all the drama of the young, where everything is at stake. Back porches, ramshackle motorcycles, the hidden intimacy of back streets, the violent danger of street gangs vying for turf, and the story of their life and death struggles told and retold with apocryphal detail from a group of observers to those who would retell and embellish them. There's the boredom of summer days and working nine to five just to break out into who knows what, and that desire -- the one that covers everything -- the one that knows that just beyond the confines of front yards and downtowns lies America, and some dream that would materialize if only one had the courage to run toward it. Springsteen's voice is full, raging, howling, crooning, and above all simply full of the magic of his own words as given life by a band who knows nothing except for putting it all on the line. In its present incarnation Born to Run once again proves its place among the greatest rock & roll albums ever recorded. This is it -- life, death, love, betrayal, and the dynamics of big-screen portrayals of the mysteries of everyday -- ordinary life boiled down to an explosive essence that carries within it everything rock & roll ever promised.</p><p>The bonus DVDs are something to behold as well. The Hammersmith Odeon concert from the tour that's included here has a set list to die for. It's adrenaline-filled and fear-drenched. These guys were scared and it fueled the gig. There's everything to prove, and the E Street Band had the quavering guts and naïveté to pull it off. These guys play their asses off; it's as if tomorrow they'll die so what the hell -- and given that the bile Brit music tabloids had the proven potential for, it was entirely possible, as Springsteen explains in his liner notes. The track list is simply incredible, from the cuts to the album at hand to those coming from Greetings from Asbury Park -- \"Lost in the Flood,\" \"Hard to Be a Saint in the City,\" \"For You,\" -- to those from The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle -- \"Fourth of July Asbury Park (Sandy),\" \"Kitty's Back,\" \"Rosalita.\" And as if this weren't enough, there is the classic \"Detroit Medley\" and \"Quarter to Three.\" This is a mind-blowing gig, filmed for preservation and forgotten about, until it was recently resurrected from Springsteen's own archives and mixed for this presentation by Bob Clearmountain.</p><p>As if all this weren't enough, there is another disc , Wings for Wheels, a kind of hodgepodge documentary on the making of the album with rare film footage from between 1973 and '75, concert footage, and the intimacy of the studio as this band struggled to keep their deal with the label -- they were on the verge of being booted into eternal obscurity as has-beens who couldn't deliver the big one. The fascination as Springsteen edits and works with Jon Landau to build the crazy, roaring Wall of Sound that became the single \"Born to Run\" is almost harrowing to watch -- not just as history, but as a gamble that paid off. This is as close to a fan's dream come true as it's going to get. But more than that, the package is the one that proves the reason for Springsteen's longevity. His faith and doubt, his willingness to go the distance, and his belief in the music itself as the conveyor of something bigger than himself to get the poetry across is awe-inspiring. Presented in this way, Born to Run is enough to make one accept that rock & roll is a force to be reckoned with rather than something to market cars, beer, and lingerie; it contains the mythic power of the ages, and dare it be said the proof that God himself can speak through a sleazy looking, beat, flesh and blood batch of street urchins using the ordinary as a means of speaking of the power, vulnerability, romance, and redemption of everyday life as something to be celebrated, struggled through, and cherished.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Try to picture the rock scene in 1974, when Bruce Springsteen started writing and recording the album that would thrust him into the national consciousness. Elvis had hit merely 18 years prior; Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and the Beatles had died or called it quits only three or four years earlier. Bob Dylan had been at it for a while and potentially seemed dated, though he was still only 33. The weight of pop music history was something that could be shrugged off, and with so much unexplored territory, bands felt an obligation to see where rock music might yet go.</p><p>In this environment Springsteen was just 24, still a kid; he'd been hailed as the New Dylan and had recorded two quirky albums but he wasn't a star. He had talent and ambition in equal measure but the thing that would put him over was his vision. Springsteen believed like no one else in the power and possibility of rock, which led him to places that seem strange and maybe even awkward to those who grew up with MTV and everything punk came to symbolize. His naïve but inspiring outlook found its purist expression in Born to Run, which Columbia has now reissued in a deluxe 30th Anniversary Edition packaged with two feature films&mdash;one documentary and one concert&mdash;on DVD.</p><p>Born to Run is a distinctive record, even in the Springsteen canon. Its world is one of impossibly romantic hyperrealism, where the mundane easily becomes fantastic, and it all happens line by line. Picture the depressed state of the Jersey Shore in the early 70s, the dull sense of an era gone, and then check Springsteen's description in the title track: \"The amusement park rises bold and stark and kids are huddled on the beach in the mist.\" This could have been a couple of bored teenagers sitting on a bench bullshitting, but with Springsteen's imagery, some glockenspiel, and a deep sax drone, it's transformed into filmic splendor. The next phrase ups the ante: \"I want to die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss.\" From one angle it's the kind of line that can make you wince, at best a silly emo cliché. The way Springsteen sang it in 1974, it wasn't a dorky diary confessional; it was unhinged expressionism, Kerouac with a bottle of red wine in his stomach. While everyone was zoning out in front of the TV this scruffy dude saw an opera out on the turnpike and a ballet being fought in the alley.</p><p>He wants to know if love is wild and real, he says, but reality isn't a particularly useful concept in the context of this record. A masterpiece Born to Run may be, but only on its own terms. Springsteen at this point didn't know much about women or relationships (\"She's the One\" is powerful and catchy but fails as a portrait of an actual person) but he had an instinct for drama, and his stories focus on plot and circumstance rather than character. Nearly every song touches on the central mythical image of the rock'n'roll era, the ideas of escape and abandon. The protagonist in \"Thunder Road\" thinks everything will change if he can make it out of town. The workers in \"Night\" suppress their daily rage by disappearing into a dark theater of sex after the whistle blows. Conflicts are all man vs. environment and man vs. society; Springsteen would get around to man vs. himself later, after he'd settled down and lived a little more.</p><p>The size extends to the sound, greatly improved on this reissue with the first wholesale remastering since it was first released on CD. Phil Spector was a well-known obsession of Springsteen's at the time, a logical complement to the room-sized thematic canvas he'd stretched. \"Jungleland\" and \"Backstreets\" are famously epic, but shorter songs like \"Thunder Road\" and \"She's the One\" seem constructed as mini-suites, with tinkly intros building to immense climaxes. The title track was Springsteen's \"Good Vibrations\", toiled over endlessly in the studio and smothered with endless layers of god knows what before finally being abandoned, flawed and perfect, to the loving arms of radio. His voice would never sound quite this strong again&mdash;perhaps he never pushed it as hard&mdash;and the slap-echo trailing a split second behind adds to the effect.</p><p>The first DVD, a complete 1975 show from the Hammersmith Odeon, is a major find. For someone like me who never got over the disappointment of only one song from 1975 on the Live 1975-85 box, this film is a revelation. The opening piano and harmonica version of \"Thunder Road\" is the scene setter, with a dim spotlight on Springsteen alone on a darkened stage and Roy Bittan playing somewhere behind. When the rest of the band joins him they have a ball, with a performance in turns earnest, theatrical, melodramatic, and clowning. It's an absolutely essential item in the Springsteen discography.</p><p>Wings for Wheels, the VH-1-ish documentary on the making of the record, is a third too long and will be of only marginal interest for anyone other than committed fans, but there's still something important here. If you can get past the repetitive and fawning testimonials from the band, producers, manager, etc., there's a wealth of information about the technical process of the album, with demonstrations of how songs evolved over time. Hearing the various parts of the dense \"Born to Run\" picked apart, for example, just the acoustic guitar or saxophone isolated, is like a mini course on how songs are mixed.</p><p>There's also Springsteen's own commentary on the songs&mdash;what they mean and how he wrote them&mdash;which is interesting if not always consistent with how I hear the record. When he says toward the end of the film that Born to Run was \"the album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedom&mdash;it was the dividing line,\" it seems to me he's exactly wrong. A dividing line may be visible, but Born to Run lies entirely on the dreamy and reckless side of maturity and is all the better for it. Every young person should be so lucky, to have a time in his or her life when the inflated romanticism of Born to Run makes perfect sense.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

This is the soundtrack for one of them, the Hammersmith Odeon concert, from beginning to end captured in vibrant sound. This show has been revered by tape traders and bootleggers for decades and never has it been presented better, thanks to Bob Clearmountain's fantastic mix. What makes this show so historically important is that it was the first time the band was able to travel overseas to play. (They were barred from doing so in the United States because of a legal battle with Springsteen's former manager.) In any case, well in advance of the gig the notorious British music weeklies began to create a pick-and-pan hype to build and topple a potential new rock messiah as they did all the time. Or, as Springsteen in his liner notes writes, \"...this week's Next...Big...Thing.\" The band was terrified yet geeked to play the hallowed hall. These guys were scared; it fueled the gig, and they pulled it off in spades. They have everything to prove, and plenty to stare down. (Hell, the media hype almost made them the standard-bearers for the entire history of American rock, whether they wanted to be or not — and they may not have believed it themselves, but they played like they felt the responsibility for it, overtly referencing Sam Cooke, Isaac Hayes, and even Boyce & Hart by including pieces of their tunes in Springsteen originals, showing where it all came from. And then, by using a portion of Celtic soulman Van Morrison's \"Moondance\" — who was taking his own bit from David \"Fathead\" Newman's read of his former boss Ray Charles — in \"Kitty's Back,\" they reveal clearly that the Beatles, the Stones, and the Who were nowhere to be found on this night.) Most of all, the E Street Band had the quivering guts and naïveté to pull it off. These guys play their asses off; it's as if tomorrow they'll die, so what the hell. The tape proves this show to be adrenaline-filled and fear-drenched. This is a mind-blowing gig. It was filmed for preservation and forgotten about until being resurrected by Springsteen.</p><p>The highlights? Hell, everything here. It begins with a tenderly desperate, under-orchestrated \"Thunder Road,\" sprints head on into a burning \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\" before whispering into a free jazz intro to a dramatic, swaggering \"Spirit in the Night\" that oozes street-smart Jersey soul. And the train never stops; it only slows a bit for moments at a time. And it's not for the band to catch its breath; it's for the crowd, whether it's the frighteningly intense \"Lost in the Flood,\" the shuffling country roots rock that introduces the rollicking \"She's the One,\" or the swaggering anthem of \"Born to Run,\" which only take listeners through a little over half of the first disc! They had the audience after \"Spirit,\" but they were into something deeper, wilder — check the spit and vinegar in \"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City\" — so they kept pushing harder. This was a young band that musically was as good as anybody on that night. They were rehearsed, confident, and armed with a collection of songs that virtually any musician worth his or her salt would kill to have written even one of. Disc two offers no letdown. There's arguably the single most intense read of \"Jungleland\" on tape, and a riotously joyful version of \"Rosalita\" to counter the theater of darkness just visited upon the crowd in the previous song. This version of \"Fourth of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\" is pure street urchin romance taken to the nth level. The E Streeters' read of the \"Detroit Medley\" is an homage to Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, whose scorching takes on Little Richard's \"Jenny Take a Ride,\" \"Devil with a Blue Dress,\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" offer spiritual inspiration. They stay on full stun with \"For You\" and cap it all with \"Quarter to Three,\" leaving the crowd to fall back into the night, wondering if they could believe what they'd just witnessed. Springsteen himself says the night was a blur to him and he never looked back for 30 years at the film or even listened to the show. While the soundtrack is only half the experience of the Hammersmith Odeon 1975 document, it's a worthy half and a necessary set to add to any Springsteen live shelf.</p> <p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>Coming three years, and one extended court battle, after the commercial breakthrough of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town was highly anticipated. Some attributed the album's embattled tone to Springsteen's legal troubles, but it carried on from Born to Run, in which Springsteen had first begun to view his colorful cast of characters as \"losers.\" On Darkness, he began to see them as the working class. One song was called \"Factory,\" and in another, \"Badlands,\" \"you\" work \"'neath the wheel / Till you get your facts learned.\" Those \"facts\" are that \"Poor man wanna be rich / Rich man wanna be king / And a king ain't satisfied / Till he rules everything.\" But Springsteen's characters, some of whom he inhabited and sang for in the first person, had little and were in danger of losing even that. Their only hope for redemption lay in working harder -- \"You gotta live it everyday,\" he sang in \"Badlands,\" but you also, as another song noted, have to \"Prove It All Night.\" And their only escape lay in driving. Springsteen presented these hard truths in hard rock settings, the tracks paced by powerful drumming and searing guitar solos. Though not as heavily produced as Born to Run, Darkness was given a full-bodied sound, with prominent keyboards and double-tracked vocals. Springsteen's stories were becoming less heroic, but his musical style remained grand. Yet the sound, and the conviction in his singing, added weight to songs like \"Racing in the Street\" and the title track, transforming the pathetic into the tragic. But despite the rock & roll fervor, Darkness was no easy listen, and it served notice that Springsteen was already willing to risk his popularity for his principles. Indeed, Darkness was not as big a seller as Born to Run. And it presaged even starker efforts, such as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

But Born in the U.S.A., his popular triumph, which threw off seven Top Ten hits and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, trafficked in much the same struggle, albeit set to galloping rhythms and set off by chiming guitars. That the witless wonders of the Reagan regime attempted to co-opt the title track as an election-year campaign song wasn't so surprising: the verses described the disenfranchisement of a lower-class Vietnam vet, and the chorus was intended to be angry, but it came off as anthemic. Then, too, Springsteen had softened his message with nostalgia and sentimentality, and those are always crowd-pleasers. \"Glory Days\" may have employed Springsteen's trademark disaffection, yet it came across as a couch potato's drunken lament. But more than anything else, Born in the U.S.A. marked the first time that Springsteen's characters really seemed to relish the fight and to have something to fight for. They were not defeated (\"No Surrender\"), and they had friendship (\"Bobby Jean\") and family (\"My Hometown\") to defend. The restless hero of \"Dancing in the Dark\" even pledged himself in the face of futility, and for Springsteen, that was a step. The \"romantic young boys\" of his first two albums, chastened by \"the working life\" encountered on his third, fourth, and fifth albums and having faced the despair of his sixth, were still alive on this, his seventh, with their sense of humor and their determination intact. Born in the U.S.A. was their apotheosis, the place where they renewed their commitment and where Springsteen remembered that he was a rock & roll star, which is how a vastly increased public was happy to treat him.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Long before he sold substantial numbers of records, Bruce Springsteen began to earn a reputation as the best live act in rock & roll. Fans had been clamoring for a live album for a long time, and with Live 1975-85 they got what they wanted, at least in terms of bulk. His concerts were marathons, and this box set, including 40 tracks and running over three and a half hours, was about the average length of a show. In his brief liner notes, Springsteen spoke of the emergence of the album's \"story\" as he reviewed live tapes, and that story seems nothing less than a history of his life, his concerns, and his career. The first cuts present the Springsteen of the early to mid-'70s; these performances, most of them drawn from a July 1978 show at the Roxy in Los Angeles, give us the romantic, hopeful, earnest Springsteen of \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\" and \"Thunder Road.\" The second section begins with his first Top Ten hit, \"Hungry Heart\" -- this is the Springsteen of the late '70s and early '80s, an arena rock star with working-class concerns. After an acoustic mini-set given largely to material from Nebraska -- songs of economic desperation and crime -- comes a reshuffling of Born in the U.S.A., songs in which Springsteen and his characters start to fight back and rock out. Finally, he brings it all back home to New Jersey, starting with the unofficial state anthem, \"Born to Run,\" and including \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" and \"Jersey Girl.\" Fans could rejoice that it found room for seven previously unreleased songs, including \"Because the Night,\" but it wasn't as funny, as moving, or as exhilarating as a Springsteen show could be. Maybe no single album, however long, could have been, but where Springsteen impressed in concert because he tried so hard, here he seemed to have tried a little too hard to make a live album carry the freight of everything he had to say.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

It was recorded and released quickly, easily qualifying as the speediest project Springsteen has ever completed. Unfortunately, it occasionally feels a little slapdash, but it's hard to criticize a four-song live charity EP for being haphazardly assembled, since that's in its nature. Nevertheless, Chimes of Freedom is a little unsatisfying, even though it's a good, brief sampler of the Boss live circa Tunnel of Love. And that's part of the problem. Tunnel of Love had a slicker production than a normal Springsteen record, featuring synths scattered throughout the record. Those arrangements were preserved on the live version of \"Tougher Than the Rest,\" one of the best songs from the record, and it turns a little mushy in an arena setting. Similarly, the title track has its chiming opening refrain played on synths, and consequently it sounds a little stiff and dated. These faults are balanced by the remaining two cuts, the first released version of the excellent \"Be True\" and a reworking of \"Born to Run\" as an acoustic ballad. \"Born to Run\" has considerable power in this stripped-down setting, and \"Be True\" teems with life, pointing out how stiff its cousins sound on Chimes of Freedom. Neither of these tracks are major contributions to Springsteen's catalog, but they're nice additions for the die-hard fans who will be picking up the EP anyway.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Bruce Springsteen has always been steeped in mainstream pop/rock music, using it as a vocabulary for what he wanted to say about weightier matters. And he has always written generic pop as well, though he's usually given the results away to performers like Southside Johnny and Gary \"U.S.\" Bonds. Sometimes, those songs have been hits -- think of the Pointer Sisters' \"Fire\" or Bonds' \"This Little Girl Is Mine.\" Occasionally, Springsteen has used such material here and there on his own albums; some of it can be found on The River, for example. But Human Touch was the first Bruce Springsteen album to consist entirely of this kind of minor genre material, material he seems capable of turning out endlessly and effortlessly -- the point of \"I Wish I Were Blind\" is that the singer doesn't want to see, now that his baby has left him; \"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\" is about TV; \"Real Man\" finds the singer declaring that, while he may not be an action hero like Rambo, he feels like a real man in his baby's arms. And Springsteen, having largely jettisoned the E Street Band (keyboardist Roy Bittan remained), enlisted some sturdy minor talent to play and sing, among them ace studio drummer Jeff Porcaro (on one of his final recording sessions), Sam Moore of Sam & Dave, and Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers. It's pleasant enough stuff, and easy to listen to, but it is not the kind of record Springsteen had conditioned his audience to expect, and its release brought considerable disappointment. The reaction was exacerbated by the drawn-out release schedule that by 1992 had become common to superstars: this simply wasn't the record Springsteen fans had waited four and a half years to hear. Though at nearly 59 minutes it was the longest single-disc album of his career (which is not even counting the fact that a second whole album was released simultaneously), and though it contained several songs that could have been big hits -- the \"Tunnel of Love\" sound-alike title track, which actually made the Top 40, \"Roll of the Dice,\" an AOR radio favorite, \"Man's Job,\" and even \"Soul Driver,\" which belonged on the next Southside album -- Human Touch was an uninspired Bruce Springsteen album, his first that didn't at least aspire to greatness. Springsteen may have put out the more substantial Lucky Town at the same time in recognition of the relatively slight nature of the material here.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

It was part of the network's Unplugged series, but after performing the first, previously unheard song \"Red Headed Woman\" alone on guitar, Springsteen shouted, \"All right, let's rock it!,\" and departed from the acoustic format. (The album's title has an \"X\" drawn through the \"Un\" of \"Unplugged.\") Eight of the selections come from Springsteen's 1992 albums <i>Human Touch</i> and <i>Lucky Town</i>, and the relatively minor tracks from the former benefit from being sequenced among the more ambitious songs from the latter and such old favorites as \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" and \"Thunder Road.\" Though Springsteen and his new band don't \"rock it\" too hard for the most part, a notable exception is a performance of the previously unrecorded \"Light of Day,\" a title song Springsteen wrote for a 1987 movie. Here, he gives a taste of the enthusiasm and spontaneity he can bring to his live performances.

Working without the E Street Band (except keyboardist Roy Bittan) for the time being, having divorced one wife and married another (singer and bandmate Patty Scialfa), Springsteen had released <i>Human Touch</i> and <i>Lucky Town</i>, two \"solo\" records, about eight months before this November 1992 MTV appearance. Selections from those two underrated albums account for over half of this 114-minute set's 19 songs (including three that weren't part of the original broadcast), and while Bruce is still Bruce (\"Human Touch,\" for instance, is a classic Springsteen song), some changes are definitely apparent. He has always been an impassioned performer, but he seems genuinely energized by the presence of Scialfa (can \"Red-Headed Woman\" be about anyone but her?) and his young new band, including guitarist Shane Fontayne, drummer Zachary Alford, and no less than five backup singers. These folks rock their butts off, basically, especially on a wild, extended version of \"Light of Day\"; there's even some experimentation happening, like the various sound effects added to \"57 Channels (and Nothin' On).\" OK, so there's no \"Born in the U.S.A.\" or \"Born to Run\"; as far as standards go, you'll have to be satisfied with \"Atlantic City,\" \"Glory Days,\" and an acoustic \"Thunder Road\" (Live in New York City, another superb DVD, is heavier on the hits).

He returned to work in the fall of 1991, intending to add a song, but ended up recording a whole new album, Lucky Town, and then decided to release both records at the same time in the spring of 1992. He might have been better off pulling a couple of the stronger songs from the earlier album, adding them to the later one (which runs less than 40 minutes), and shelving the rest. While Human Touch was a disappointing album of second-rate material, Lucky Town is an ambitious collection addressing many of Springsteen's major concerns and moving them forward. Here was the rage and the humor, the sense of compassion, the loyalty and commitment that had been the stuff of Springsteen's best music from the beginning. Songs like \"Better Days\" and \"Local Hero\" commented on and deflated the commercial success with which Springsteen clearly felt uncomfortable; \"If I Should Fall Behind\" and \"Book of Dreams\" expressed romantic fidelity and generosity; \"Souls of the Departed\" contained scathing social commentary; and \"My Beautiful Reward\" was a meditative epilogue. The lyrics were better, the arrangements tighter, the performances more powerful than those on the companion release. If Lucky Town, like Tunnel of Love and Human Touch before it, sounded a little under-produced, it nevertheless had the mark of the major artist Springsteen is, and if he had released it alone, it might have had a more significant impact.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Especially in their sound, several of the songs, \"Cautious Man\" and \"Two Faces,\" for example, could have fit seamlessly onto Nebraska, though the arrangements overall were not as stripped-down and acoustic as on the earlier album. While Nebraska was filled with songs of economic desperation, however, Tunnel of Love, as its title suggested, was an album of romantic exploration. But the lovers were just as desperate in their way as Nebraska's small-time criminals. In song after song, Springsteen questioned the trust and honesty on both sides in a romantic relationship, specifically a married relationship. Since Springsteen sounded more autobiographical than ever before (\"Ain't Got You\" referred to his popular success, while \"Walk Like a Man\" seemed another explicit message to his father), it was hard not to wonder about the state of his own two-and-a-half-year marriage, and it wasn't surprising when that marriage collapsed the following year. Tunnel of Love was not the album that the ten million fans who had bought Born in the U.S.A. as of 1987 were waiting for, and though it topped the charts, sold three million copies, and spawned three Top 40 hits, much of this was on career momentum. Springsteen was as much at a crossroads with his audience as he seemed to be in his work and in his personal life, though this was not immediately apparent.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

While a Springsteen \"hits\" collection logically would contain such Top Ten singles as \"I'm on Fire\" and his cover of Edwin Starr's \"War,\" few Springsteen fans would miss their omission; on the other hand, many would support the inclusion of \"Blinded by the Light\" and \"Pink Cadillac,\" Top Ten hits for Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Natalie Cole; and anyone even remotely familiar with Springsteen's albums and concerts would have trouble countenancing the absence of such non-singles as \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\" and \"Thunder Road.\" Facing this challenge, Springsteen has adopted his own set of criteria. First, he seems to have wanted to pack as much music onto a single disc as possible, the result being a CD-busting 76:47 running time. Second, he seems to have wanted to include as many tracks as possible, even if that means editing songs; as a result, 18 tracks are included, though five have been substantially shortened -- \"My Hometown\" (by 24 seconds), \"Glory Days\" (by 29 seconds), \"Human Touch\" (by 82 seconds), \"Better Days\" (by 23 seconds), and \"Streets of Philadelphia\" (by 60 seconds). Third, like many artists, he is more interested in including his recent material than his older material, so there is nothing from Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. or The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle -- no \"Blinded by the Light,\" \"Spirit in the Night,\" \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy),\" or \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\" -- but both sides of his 1992 single \"Human Touch\"/\"Better Days\" are included. Fourth, he has not felt bound to interpret the album's title to mean he must include his most successful singles: the Top 40 hits \"Prove It All Night\" and \"One Step Up\" and the Top Tens \"Cover Me,\" \"I'm on Fire,\" \"I'm Goin' Down,\" \"War,\" and \"Tunnel of Love\" are left off, while the album tracks \"Thunder Road,\" \"The River,\" and \"Atlantic City\" and the minor chart single \"Badlands\" are included. Fifth, he has opted to include both a couple of new songs (\"Secret Garden\" and \"Blood Brothers\"), a previously unreleased outtake (\"Murder Incorporated\"), and a new recording of a previously unreleased old song (\"This Hard Land\"). All of which is to say that Greatest Hits is a hodgepodge. Springsteen considered calling it something other than Greatest Hits (one idea: This Hard Land), and that might have been a better idea if he was going to fiddle with the concept this much. Nevertheless, some of Springsteen's best and best-known hit recordings are here -- \"Born to Run,\" \"Hungry Heart,\" \"Dancing in the Dark,\" \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" and the then-recent \"Streets of Philadelphia,\" the success of which probably prompted the release of this compilation in the first place.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In 1982, with Ronald Reagan in the White House and much of America torn between a newly fierce patriotism and the dispassionate conservatism of the dawning \"Greed Is Good\" era, a number of roots-oriented rock musicians began examining the State of the Union in song, and one of the most powerful albums to come out of this movement was Bruce Springsteen's stark, home-recorded masterpiece Nebraska. In 1995, Bill Clinton was president, America was congratulating itself for a new era of high-tech peace and prosperity, and Springsteen returned to the themes and approach of Nebraska with The Ghost of Tom Joad, an album that suggested little had changed in the past 13 years -- except Americans had gotten better at ignoring the increasingly sharp divide between the rich and the poor, and that illegal aliens who had come to America looking for the fabled Land of Milk and Honey were being forced to shoulder a heavy and dangerous burden in America's underground economy. With several of its songs drawn directly from news stories, The Ghost of Tom Joad is more explicitly political than Nebraska (more so than anything in Springsteen's catalog, for that matter), and while the arrangements are more full-bodied than those on Nebraska (five cuts feature a full band), the production and the overall tone is, if anything, even starker and more low-key, with the lyrics all the more powerful for their spare backdrops. While there's an undertow of bitterness in this album's tales of an America that has turned its back on the working class and the foreign-born, there's also a tremendous compassion in songs like \"The Line,\" \"Sinaloa Cowboys,\" \"Balboa Park,\" and the title cut, which lend their subjects a dignity fate failed to give them. Individually, these songs, either angry or plaintive, are clean and expertly drawn tales of life along this nation's margins, and their cumulative effect is nothing short of heartbreaking; anyone who pegged Springsteen as a zealously patriotic conservative in the wake of the widely misunderstood Born in the U.S.A. needs to hear this disc. The Ghost of Tom Joad failed to find the same audience (or the same wealth of media attention) that embraced Nebraska, but on it's own terms it's a striking and powerful album, and certainly one of Springsteen's most deeply personal works.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

Every time he cut an album, he recorded a surplus of songs and left some out, not always on the basis of quality, but often because they simply didn't suit the mood of the record. It was inevitable that dedicated fans and collectors would bootleg these recordings, and for many years, he was one of the most popular bootlegged artists, rivaling even Bob Dylan. Dylan released a box set of unreleased songs in 1991, paving the way for the long-overdue appearance of a similar Springsteen set, Tracks, in 1998. Spanning four discs, it isn't entirely devoted to unreleased material -- a few B-sides pop up here and there -- nor is it truly definitive, since it misses a number of key outtakes, plus his original version of \"Because the Night,\" the sole hit for Patti Smith. Instead, the compilation is an unassuming sampling of what's in the vaults, from his early acoustic demos to polished outtakes from Human Touch and Lucky Town. Along the way, there are a number of great songs -- \"Bishop Danced\" is every bit as terrific as its legend, as are \"Thundercrack,\" \"Give the Girl a Kiss,\" \"Hearts of Stone,\" \"Roulette,\" and many others. Tracks merely offers fans an enjoyably sequenced selection of what was left behind. If the end result isn't as revelatory as some may have expected (even the acoustic \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" powerful as it is, doesn't sound any different than you may have imagined it), it's because Springsteen is, at heart, a solid craftsman, not a blinding visionary like Dylan. That's why Tracks is for the dedicated fan, where The Bootleg Series and The Basement Tapes are flat-out essential for rock fans.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>18 Tracks is a single-disc distillation of 1998's four-CD box set Tracks, the superb retrospective assembling unreleased material spanning the breadth of Bruce Springsteen's storied career; also featuring three previously unissued songs, this new, streamlined release is a frustration from both a critical and consumer standpoint. The issue of record company greed aside, the greatest disservice is actually to those listeners who buy the disc as a substitute for the full Tracks box; each of its 66 cuts is an invaluable addition to the Springsteen songbook, so even casual fans need the complete package to discover lost classics like \"Thundercrack,\" \"Give the Girl a Kiss,\" \"Wages of Sin,\" and \"The Wish\" — just 18 of these gems are simply not enough. Which means, then, that 18 Tracks is ultimately most essential for those hardcore fans who already shelled out for most of the material in question anyway; and though it's appalling to force the devoted to buy a full-length album for just three new songs, at least each is excellent, in particular longtime fan favorites \"The Fever\" and \"The Promise\" (the latter newly recorded for inclusion here).</p><p><b>&mdash; Jason Ankeny</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>The many voices that come out of the ether on Bruce Springsteen's The Rising all seem to have two things in common: the first is that they are writing from the other side, from the day after September 11, 2001, the day when life began anew, more uncertain than ever before. The other commonality that these voices share is the determination that life, however fraught with tragedy and confusion, is precious and should be lived as such. On this reunion with the E Street Band, Bruce Springsteen offers 15 meditations -- in grand rock & roll style -- on his own way of making sense of the senseless. The band is in fine form, though with Brendan O'Brien's uncanny production, they play with an urgency and rawness they've seldom shown. This may not have been the ideal occasion for a reunion after 15 years, but it's one they got, and they go for broke. The individual tracks offer various glimpses of loss, confusion, hope, faith, resolve, and a good will that can only be shown by those who have been tested by fire. The music and production is messy, greasy; a lot of the mixes bleed tracks onto one another, giving it a more homemade feel than any previous E Street Band outing. And yes, that's a very good thing.</p><p>The set opens with \"Lonesome Day,\" a midtempo rocker with country-ish roots. Springsteen's protagonist admits to his or her shortcomings in caring for the now-absent beloved. But despite the grief and emptiness, there is a wisdom that emerges in questioning what remains: \"Better ask questions before you shoot/Deceit and betrayal's bitter fruit/It's hard to swallow come time to pay/That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away/Let kingdom come/I'm gonna find my way/ Through this lonesome day.\" Brendan O'Brien's hurdy-gurdy cuts through the mix like a ghost, offering a view of an innocent past that has been forever canceled because it never was anyway; the instrument, like the glockenspiels that trim Bruce Springsteen's songs, offers not only texture, but a kind of formalist hint that possibilities don't always lie in the future. Lest anyone mistakenly perceive this recording as a somber evocation of loss and despair, it should also be stated that this is very much an E Street Band recording. Clarence Clemons is everywhere, and the R&B swing and slip of the days of yore is in the house -- especially on \"Waitin' for a Sunny Day,\" \"Countin' on a Miracle,\" \"Mary's Place\" (with a full horn section), and the souled-out \"Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin).\" These tracks echo the past with their loose good-time feel, but \"echo\" is the key word. Brendan O'Brien's guitar-accented production offers us an E Street Band coming out of the ether and stepping in to fill a void. The songs themselves are, without exception, rooted in loss, but flower with the possibility of moving into what comes next, with a hard-won swagger and busted-up grace. They offer balance and a shifting perspective, as well as a depth that is often deceptive.</p><p>The title track is one of Springsteen's greatest songs. It is an anthem, but not in the sense you usually reference in regard to his work. This anthem is an invitation to share everything, to accept everything, to move through everything individually and together. Power-chorded guitars and pianos entwine in the choruses with a choir, and Clemons wails on a part with a stinging solo. With The Rising, Springsteen has found a way to be inclusive and instructive without giving up his particular vision as a songwriter, nor his considerable strength as a rock & roll artist. In fact, if anything, The Rising is one of the very best examples in recent history of how popular art can evoke a time period and all of its confusing and often contradictory notions, feelings, and impulses. There are tales of great suffering in The Rising to be sure, but there is joy, hope, and possibility, too. Above all, there is a celebration and reverence for everyday life. And if we need anything from rock & roll, it's that. It would be unfair to lay on Bruce Springsteen the responsibility of guiding people through the aftermath of a tragedy and getting on with the business of living, but rock & roll as impure, messy, and edifying as this helps.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In the liner notes to his volume of Columbia's Essential series, Bruce Springsteen immediately lays out the problem with hits collections: \"In any body of work there are obvious high points. The rest depends on who's doing the listening. Where you were, when it was, who you were with when a particular song or album cut the deepest.\" All artists have this problem, but Springsteen has it more than most, since he not only has a deep and varied body of work, but he has a passionate, dedicated fan base. Within that following, there are listeners who prefer his big-hearted, sprawling early work, those who love the cinematic grandeur of Born to Run, those who love his stark, intimate acoustic ballads, and those who adore his pile-driving rockers. He's had hits in all of these styles, and he's had concert and album rock radio staples in all those styles -- all of these tunes for his basic canon, the \"obvious high points\" -- but he's such a strong songwriter and record-maker that this leaves behind songs that many other artists would be thrilled to call their best work, whether it's the epic street poetry of \"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City\" or the old-time rock & roll throwaway of \"Pink Cadillac.\" Neither of those tunes are on the double-disc, 30-track Essential Bruce Springsteen, but any two-disc set can't hold all of Springsteen's great songs. It can only offer a representative sampling, which means there will be lots of terrific tracks and fan favorites absent -- Springsteen admits this, citing \"Growin' Up,\" \"Racing in the Street,\" \"Backstreets,\" and \"My City of Ruins\" as MIA, while others could make just as convincing an argument for \"My Hometown,\" \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,\" \"Fade Away,\" \"I'm on Fire,\" \"Prove It All Night,\" \"Adam Raised a Cain,\" and the list goes on. The strength of The Essential is that you never notice these songs are missing. Unlike the previous Bruce compilation, the misguided, haphazardly selected Greatest Hits, The Essential contains all the big songs -- not just the obvious hits of \"Hungry Heart,\" \"Born to Run,\" \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" and \"Glory Days,\" but selections from his first two albums that were ignored completely the previous time out -- and it also contains just the right amount of latter-day material from the acclaimed The Rising, plus \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" and \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" two songs previously only available on Live in New York City. It adds up to an ideal introduction to Springsteen's music, capturing all sides of his musical output while being a hell of a good listen.</p><p>While the two main discs are for neophytes and casual fans, the third \"bonus\" disc is for the hardcore -- the kind of fans who will argue about the song selection on the previous two discs, and would be more interested in unreleased material than hits. This third disc is a clearing-house for items that should have made it to his previous rarities collection, Tracks, but didn't. This includes previously unreleased cuts, B-sides, contributions to soundtracks and benefit albums, covers, and an alternate, \"country-blues\" acoustic version of \"Countin' on a Miracle\" from The Rising. The disc follows a roughly chronological sequence and basically divides into early-'80s material and mid-'90s material. The '80s material has the edge due to the variety and strength of the material: the rampaging rocker \"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),\" a song Bruce gave to Dave Edmunds and has never released before now; the spare, tough \"The Big Payback,\" a B-side; the searching \"None but the Brave,\" cut during the Born in the U.S.A. sessions; the evocative \"County Fair,\" cut after Nebraska; a cover of Jimmy Cliff's \"Trapped,\" cut on the River tour; a wonderfully raucous live \"Held Up Without a Gun,\" a variation on \"You Can Look but You Better Not Touch\" with topical lyrics previously released as a B-side. These are fantastic performances, and while there are also very good cuts of a more recent vintage -- such as the Joe Grushecky collaboration \"Code of Silence,\" his title song from Tim Robbins' Dead Man Walking, and a fun version of \"Viva Las Vegas\" -- these '80s songs are the heart of the collection. It's an unexpected gift to have them officially released as a bonus disc to a hits collection, and for the hardcore, it's worth buying two discs of songs you already have just get these rarities. And it helps make The Essential Bruce Springsteen really live up to its title.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>It's been a long time since Springsteen has been hip, if he ever was. His coolness was in question even back in the '70s, despite the grudging thumbs-up (\"Springsteen is all right\") Lou Reed gave him on the live album Take No Prisoners. The aging population that loves \"real rock 'n' roll\" are his biggest supporters, from rock critic turned producer/manager Jon Landau through biographer Dave Marsh and on down. If Springsteen partied with Warhol, the photos are rarely anthologized.</p><p>Springsteen is neither glamorous nor mysterious, but as this three-disc compilation demonstrates, he is an extremely talented and important artist. Assembled as part of Columbia's Essential repackaging of its signature artists, The Essential Bruce Springsteen is a fine introduction to his work and it atones for the shoddy 1995 compilation Greatest Hits (12 tracks are common to both). The previous Hits collection was both too brief, and poorly selected. The Essential stretches 30 of Springsteen's best-known songs over two discs and then adds a third of odds-and-ends.</p><p>Springsteen's career has been a series of attacks and retreats. He stormed out of the gate in 1973 on Greetings from Asbury Park as a word-drunk boho who spent as much time in Manhattan as he did on the Jersey shore. Manfred Mann and Greg Kihn made \"Blinded by the Light\" and \"For You\" into hits by omitting words, smoothing out Springsteen's chaotic phrasing and tightening the rhythm. The original versions here are loose and elastic as they come, with rubbery drumming by early E Streeter Vinnie Lopez that was the polar opposite of Max Weinberg's robotic thud. The race for the rock 'n' roll prize picked up steam later that year with The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, but here, Springsteen traded some of the goofy Dylanesque wordplay of his debut for detailed, romantic character studies that borrowed from Van Morrison. When Tom Waits described Springsteen's songs from this period as \"little black and white films,\" he was talking about material like \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\". And there has never been a bar band rave-up quite like \"Rosalita\", which is structured like a suite without losing any of its whiteboy R&B; energy.</p><p>The final phase of Springsteen's early charge was the 1975 album Born to Run, where he openly stated that he was trying to make the greatest rock album of all time (later he clarified that what he was shooting for was Phil Spector producing Roy Orbison with words by Dylan). Songs like \"Born to Run\" and \"Jungleland\" are overblown to a degree that some find comical (here is the structural template for Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell). It's true, these songs swirl and build and jump from one discrete section to the next, and who now would try and get away with the line, \"I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight in an everlasting kiss\"? (Andrew WK, maybe.) This is rock mythology as gospel music, and there is no possible way to appreciate it other than to give yourself over to it completely.</p><p>Darkness on the Edge of Town from 1978 was the first retreat. Springsteen's lyrical focus darkened as his sound became leaner. This was the record in which Springsteen saw economy as a storytelling virtue, perhaps in emulation of fiction writers he admired like Flannery O'Connor. Unfortunately, Darkness is probably the album served most poorly by Essential. The omission of \"Racing in the Street\" is puzzling, considering that it's one of Springsteen's best ballads and also manages to turn the mythology of \"Born to Run\" completely on its head. \"Candy's Room\" is one of his best rock songs and should have replaced \"Promised Land\".</p><p>The two-disc album The River is difficult to pull from for an anthology. It was something of a summary of what Springsteen had done to that point, its upbeat frat-rock cuts alternating with country weepers. The Essential chooses \"Hungry Heart\" and \"The River\", one great song from each end of the spectrum. Obvious choices, certainly, but sensible. \"Hungry Heart\" was Springsteen's first Top 10 single and he followed that popularity by drawing inward and recording the solo acoustic Nebraska, the album that has certainly become the indie rock favorite in Springsteen's catalog. He was at home with the four-track years before it became an indie cliché, and he was writing stark, superbly focused songs that people have been covering ever since. \"Nebraska\" and \"Atlantic City\" are the two represented here, again completely obvious choices but ones that make the most sense for a Springsteen newcomer.</p><p>The second disc of The Essential picks up with \"Born in the USA\". At some point after Nebraska, Springsteen decided to kick his career back into high gear. His sound got huge, he became versed in the ways of MTV (though his videos were awful), and he basically lived in stadiums for a couple years. Born in the USA has little to recommend to an indie purist but listen to \"Dancing in the Dark\" and it's easy to hear why it was so popular: Springsteen's melodic gift was at its peak. The Essential adds \"Glory Days\", which I never liked (I would have swapped it for \"I'm on Fire\", the album's subtlest moment), and the title track, about which little remains to be said. It was ironic but the patriots loved (and love) it.</p><p>After the deluge of Born in the USA, Springsteen laid low for a good ten years to make quieter music and eventually raise a family. Tunnel of Love from 1987, recorded largely alone at his home studio, is Springsteen's most underrated album and certainly his last great one. The title track has the booming synth-pop sound of the preceding record, but Springsteen is painting with a finer brush and dealing with emotion in the abstract. \"Brilliant Disguise\" is perhaps Springsteen's finest lyric, a sharply observed mediation on vulnerability and self-doubt. The two albums Springsteen released in 1992 were the weakest of his career, and Essential rescues the titles cuts and \"Living Proof\" from the heap (though only \"Human Touch\" approaches the best of Tunnel of Love).</p><p>Springsteen peaked melodically in the early 80s, but he's compensated for his weaker tunes since by becoming a more skilled storyteller. The Ghost of Tom Joad has the stark sound and detail of some Nebraska songs, but the title track, represented here, lacks a tune that sounds like it has always existed. The events of 9/11 energized Springsteen, calling him back to the spotlight for his first record with the E Street band since Born in the USA. I like the melody of \"The Rising\", but it sounds an awful lot like Steve Miller's \"Jet Airliner\", and \"Mary's Place\" doesn't have nearly enough of a hook for a song about a party. As demonstrated on these songs and the live tribute to Amadou Diallo, \"American Skin (41 Shots)\", Springsteen addresses big contemporary topics with nuance, but it's tough to listen to songs repeatedly when you know they're connected with a single real-life event.</p><p>The bonus rarities disc is spotty but has awesome highs. It's great to finally have Springsteen's dynamic live cover of Jimmy Cliff's \"Trapped\" on CD, which was previously released only on the USA for Africa album (it was a radio staple in 1985). The slow, gentle \"Lift Me Up\", which Springsteen recorded for a John Sayles film, has an ungodly beautiful falsetto and perhaps Springsteen's best melody of the 90s. I could do without the cover of \"Viva Las Vegas\", however, and \"Code of Silence\" is a Springsteen rocker on autopilot. But that's why they're a bonus. The meat of this collection is enough to chew on for a lifetime. The two discs get the Springsteen story as right as is possible in 150 minutes, and if they don't work, then Springsteen is definitely not for you.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Every decade or so, Bruce Springsteen releases a somber album of narrative songs, character sketches, and folk tunes -- records that play not like rock & roll, but rather as a collection of short stories. <i>Nebraska</i>, released in the fall of 1982 during the rise of Reagan's America, was the first of these, with the brooding <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i> following in 1995, in the thick of the Clinton administration but before the heady boom days of the late '90s. At the midpoint of George W. Bush's administration, Springsteen released <i>Devils & Dust</i>, another collection of story songs that would seem on the surface to be a companion to <i>Nebraska</i> and <i>Ghost</i>, but in actuality is quite a different record than either. While the characters that roam through <i>Devils & Dust</i> are similarly heartbroken, desperate, and downtrodden, they're far removed from the criminals and renegades of <i>Nebraska</i>, and the album doesn't have the political immediacy of <i>Ghost's</i> latter-day Woody Guthrie-styled tales -- themes that tied together those two albums. Here, the songs and stories are loosely connected. Several are set in the West, some are despairing, some have signs of hope, a couple are even sweet and light. Springsteen's writing is similarly varied, occasionally hearkening back to the spare, dusty prose of <i>Nebraska</i>, but often it's densely composed, assured, and evocative, written as if the songs were meant to be read aloud, not sung. But the key to <i>Devils & Dust</i>, and why it's his strongest record in a long time, is that the music is as vivid and varied as the words.</p><p>Unlike the meditative, monochromatic <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i>, this has different shades of color, so somber epics like \"The Hitter\" or the sad, lonely \"Reno\" are balanced by the lighter \"Long Time Comin',\" \"Maria's Bed,\" and \"All I'm Thinkin' About,\" while the moodier \"Black Cowboys\" and \"Devils & Dust\" are enhanced by subtly cinematic productions. It results in a record that's far removed in feel from the stark, haunting Nebraska, but on a song-for-song level, it's nearly as strong, since its stories linger in the imagination as long as the ones from that 1982 masterpiece (and they stick around longer than those from Ghost, as well). <i>Devils & Dust</i> is also concise and precisely constructed, two things the otherwise excellent 2002 comeback <i>The Rising</i> was not, and that sharp focus helps make this the leanest, artiest, and simply best Springsteen record in many years. [<i>Devils & Dust</i> was released only as a DualDisc, a disc that contains a CD on one side and a DVD on the flip. The DVD contains a 5.1 mix of the album, plus a 30-minute film containing interviews with Springsteen and footage of him performing five songs live in the upstairs of a house; in other words, it's a staged performance, not a concert. The interviews are enjoyable, if not particularly interesting, while the live acoustic performances are not strictly unadorned -- \"Reno\" has pianos and synthesizers discreetly murmuring in the background, \"All I'm Thinkin' About\" has synths and backing vocals. It's a fine little film, but not something that merits frequent repeat viewings. The CD side appears to be copy-protected -- it did not read in either a PC with Windows XP or a Mac with OSX, so it cannot easily be ripped as MP3s].</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions is an unusual Bruce Springsteen album in a number of ways. First, it's the first covers album Springsteen has recorded in his three-decade career, which is a noteworthy event in itself, but that's not the only thing different about We Shall Overcome. Springsteen, a notorious perfectionist who has been known to tweak and rework albums numerous times before releasing them (or scrapping them, as the case may be), pulled together the album quickly, putting aside a planned second volume of the rarities collection Tracks after discovering a set of recordings he made in 1997 for a Pete Seeger tribute album called Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger. Enthralled by this handful of tracks -- one of which, \"We Shall Overcome,\" appeared on the tribute -- Springsteen decided to cut a whole album of folk tunes popularized by Pete Seeger. He rounded up 13 musicians, including some who played on those 1997 sessions, and did two one-day sessions in late 2005 and early 2006, swiftly releasing the resulting album that April. As Bruce stresses in his introductory liner notes, these were live recordings, done with no rehearsals, and We Shall Overcome does indeed have an unmistakably loose feel, and not just because you can hear the Boss call out chord changes in a handful of songs. This music is rowdy and rambling, as the group barrels head-first into songs that they're playing together as a band for the first time, and it's hard not to get swept up along in their excitement. Springsteen has made plenty of great records, but We Shall Overcome is unique in its sheer kinetic energy; he has never made a record that feels as alive as this.</p><p>Not only does We Shall Overcome feel different than Bruce's work; it also feels different than Seeger's music. Most of Seeger's recordings were spare and simple, featuring just him and his banjo; his most elaborately produced records were with the Weavers, whose recordings of the '50s did feature orchestration, yet that's a far cry from the big folk band that Springsteen uses here. Bruce's combo for the Seeger sessions has a careening, ramshackle feel that's equal parts early-'60s hootenanny and Bob Dylan and the Band's Americana; at times, its ragged human qualities also recall latter-day Tom Waits, although the music here is nowhere near as self-consciously arty as that. Springsteen has truly used Seeger's music as inspiration, using it as the starting point to take him someplace that is uniquely his own in sheer musical terms. Given that, it should be no great surprise that Bruce also picks through Seeger's songbook in a similar fashion, leaving many (if not most) of Pete's well-known songs behind in favor of a selection of folk standards Springsteen learned through Seeger's recordings. (Author/critic Dave Marsh researched the origins of each song here; there are brief introductions within the album's liner notes and thorough histories presented on the official Springsteen site.) While the songs featured here adhere to no one specific theme -- there are work songs, spirituals, narratives, and protest songs -- it is possible to see this collection of tunes as Springsteen's subtle commentary on the political state of America, especially given Seeger's reputation as an outspoken political activist, but this record should hardly be judged as merely an old-fashioned folk record. We Shall Overcome is many things, but a creaky relic is not one of them. Springsteen has drawn from Seeger's songbook -- which he assembled in the '40s, '50s, and '60s from traditional folk songs -- and turned it into something fresh and contemporary. And even if you have no patience for (or interest in) the history of the songs, or their possible meanings, it's easy to enjoy We Shall Overcome on pure musical terms: it's a rambunctious, freewheeling, positively joyous record unlike any other in Springsteen's admittedly rich catalog.</p><p>[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions was released in the U.S. as a DualDisc, containing a CD on one side and a DVD on the other. The CD side merely contains the album. The DVD contains the album in PCM stereo (there's no 5.1 mix, although given the big-band nature of this session, this album would have sounded great in Surround Sound), along with two bonus tracks, the rollicking \"Buffalo Gals\" and the moody, soulful \"How Can I Keep from Singing.\" Both bonus cuts are excellent and should have been on the album proper. There is also a 30-minute video program that chronicles some of the recording of the album, but it's not a documentary: it's more of a performance film with commentary, and while it could have been longer or had more commentary, it's still quite enjoyable. Finally, We Shall Overcome also was released separately as a vinyl LP.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>On paper, The Seeger Sessions seems like a terrible idea: traditional American folksongs paid hyper-reverent homage by one of rock'n'roll's most earnest performers, an attempt to transform campfire songs into sermons and anoint sweet, old, cord-cutting Pete Seeger high priest of Americana. Instead, this collection&mdash;consisting of songs Seeger has sung, but none he's written&mdash;is a boisterous, spirit-raising throwdown, conjured by a 12-man band (guitar, harmonica, tuba, violin, B3 organ, upright bass, banjo, piano, drums, accordion, trombone, saxophone, trumpet, and more) and a pack of grinning backup singers. Perhaps ironically, Bruce Springsteen&mdash;one of America's most-adored songsmiths&mdash;is soaring high on a record full of tracks other people wrote.</p><p>On The Seeger Sessions, Springsteen growls, warbles, groans, and gags, sounding often like Tom Waits (check the scratchy, ominous vocals on \"Erie Canal\") or later Bob Dylan. It's a stark contrast to Seeger's crisp, clear pipes, and it reinvigorates a handful of ancient American tracks. Like any good folk record, The Seeger Sessions tackles the tangle of war, strife, poverty, and unrest, but does so without sacrificing joy or release (really, the very reasons people began singing in the first place). The resulting collection happily drowns out echoes of Springsteen's underwhelming recent efforts, and just might be the very best and most inspiring album Bruce has produced in more than a decade*.*</p><p>Embracing early E Street shuffle and ditching the solemnity of 2005's Devils and Dust, The Seeger Sessions culls from a century of rich, gritty Americana tradition, from bluegrass to country to rhythm and blues to gospel, rock'n'roll, Zydeco, Dixieland, and more. Springsteen is an obvious descendent of folk tradition, but, as he writes in the record's liner notes, this is \"street corner music, parlor music, tavern music, wilderness music, circus music, church music, gutter music.\" Or: The Seeger Sessions is a party record.</p><p>Clawing through Seeger's considerable catalogue, Springsteen ultimately selected a smart, varied, and cohesive smattering of songs, proving he retains a deep and nuanced understanding of folk tradition. In a recent New Yorker profile of Seeger, Springsteen talks about folk songs as tools with potential to become \"righteous implements when connected to historical consciousness,\" and claims to have chosen this particular repertoire because, \"Everything I wanted, I found there.\" Appropriately, Spingsteen's voice seems custom-made for tracks like \"We Shall Overcome\", where his signature gravity spreads shivers, destined to silence even the most jaded listeners with its convincing optimism. Written in 1905, \"Erie Canal\" (sealed comfortably in the consciousness of any kid born or raised in western New York), is ominous and hypnotizing, with banjo picks punctuated by organs, strings, and an unexpected Dixieland breakdown midway through&mdash;it's not hard to imagine whole arenas shouting, \"Low bridge, everybody down!\"</p><p>The gorgeously explosive \"O Mary Don't You Weep\" cracks open with teasing fiddles, before horns and drums kick up and Springsteen's throaty shouts are rounded out by a bevy of backing singers, organs sliding in and out, a gloriously sloppy mélange of sound, as indebted to New Orleans as it is to Newport. Springteen's voice is gravelly and real, happily divorced from the overproduction and studio tweaking that plagues his recent work, and perfectly in sync with his band's raucous, gleeful pounding. Everyone here is loose and intoxicated, and nowhere else is the record's quasi-live conceit (the record was made in three day-long sessions, preceded by no rehearsals) as gloriously palpable.</p><p>Springsteen has a habit of folding current events into his songs without ever being specific enough to limit a verse to a single time and place. Unsurprisingly, that timelessness syncs up perfectly with the centuries-old songs on The Seeger Sessions, and, if nothing else, confirms that Bruce Springsteen was the right (and maybe only) person for this particular gig. Less an exhumation than a celebration, The Seeger Sessions is the best proof we've got that America's folksongs are also our finest artifacts. It's all here: recipes, prayers, promises, fears, hopes, and hollers.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<P>Live in Dublin by Bruce Springsteen with the Seeger Sessions band documents the final show of the group's long tour in support of the album that took them across the U.S. and Europe. Along with performances from the album itself, the show is peppered with Springsteen's own tunes. The deluxe double-CD contains 23 songs performed by a 17-piece band that includes a full horn section, backing chorus, numerous guitars, dobro, banjo, keyboards, accordion, field drums, sousaphone, euphonium, pedal steel, fiddles, standup bass, and more. The most prominently featured members of the band include Soozie Tyrell, Marc Anthony Thompson, and, of course, Patti Scialfa (who all offer wonderful duet performances). This recording stands in sharp contrast both musically and emotionally to the studio offering. We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions was recorded by a band that captured immediacy and intimacy: there is a certain raw savoir faire resulting in a bristling kind of joyous energy that only a large group of musicians unfamiliar with one another can provide. Springsteen's a perfectionist; some of the rough edges left on the studio album are a welcome surprise. Here, many of those same songs — many of which come from out of history and time — are performed by a band that became a spit-shined, polished, and utterly professional unit.</P><P>Live in Dublin offers dazzling versions that have been honed and sharpened. This is a long way from Pete Seeger and his solitary banjo playing singalongs for folk festival audiences all over the globe; and yet, somehow not. But there is something more detached about this show — and the video doubly enhances that studied feeling — though its sheer musicality and virtuosity is a wonder. The horn charts are brilliant; there is room in some of these tunes, such as \"Erie Canal,\" for old New Orleans jazz-styled soloing and interplay; the mannered time keeping is captured not only by drums and bass, but by the chorus' vocal phrasing. The show opener, \"Atlantic City,\" is radically rearranged; it's now a near-monotone blues song. In this way it resembles the kind of re-tooling that Bob Dylan often gives his songs live to keep them interesting. Other tracks from Springsteen's catalog on the first disc include \"If I Should Fall Behind.\" This one is done — at first — as a tender 19th century waltz between Scialfa and her husband. Then it transforms itself seamlessly into a communal sing, and in this way becomes a different song altogether, less intimate, but perhaps more profound. The pedal steel guitar treatment in \"Highway Patrolman\" is enhanced with upright piano, multiple acoustic guitars, and pedal steel. Springsteen's new version of Blind Alfred Reed's \"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live\" premiered at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 2006. It's complete with added lyrics that highlight the plight of Hurricane Katrina survivors; here it remains raucous and forceful. \"O Mary Don't You Weep\" is more fully a gospel tune here, its dynamic is over the top. \"Jacob's Ladder\" (a Seeger original) closes disc one.</P><P>It's a wild Dixieland cum gospel romp with full-on horns (including Sousaphone), popping field snare, and bass drum. Tyrell's great violin break — sometimes it seems as if she \"gets it\" in terms of the historical nature of these songs better than anyone else in this band — and wide ranging call and response chorale are a breathtaking finish. \"Long Time Comin'\" from Devils &amp; Dust opens disc two, and this reading is a far more compelling one. Like \"If I Should Fall Behind,\" it's so much bigger than the songwriter. It belongs not only in this mix, but in the way it's performed to the culture as shared experience. It's followed by an overly long, radical redo of \"Open All Night.\" executed as a late-'50s rock &amp; roll song with a very polished Andrews Sisters-styled female scat, before a male chorus engages them in call and response. It sounds more like something from Pump Boys at the Dinette , or, better yet, Guys and Dolls. It's a way of kickstarting a crowd for the second set; and no matter what one thinks of it musically, it works to that purpose. The Western swing (think Asleep at the Wheel) pedal steel solo and Sam Bardfeld's fiddle solo kick it into high gear, not to mention Springsteen's own acoustic guitar solo; and as has been proven thus far, the horn charts are spectacular. The accordion, fiddle, and brass driven \"Pay Me My Money Down\" is an entirely new reading of the traditional number. Its easy Cajun-esque 2-step and chorus-line-chorus structure is the loosest and most spontaneous-sounding thing on this entire set.</P><P>There are great surprises for anyone who didn't see this tour with the inclusion in the set list of both \"Growin' Up\" and \"Blinded by the Light,\" from Springsteen's debut album (the latter is a bonus cut). The former begins as a solo acoustic tune with a new melody and becomes a string and horn driven, skittering country song. The latter, with a Latin rhythm, Cuban son structure, and minor key signature, is a new song entirely. In addition, Springsteen's inventive folk song treatment of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" is here, as is the singalong gospel number \"This Little Light of Mine.\" This, as the official close of the show, is a crowd-pleaser and a barnstormer. The chorus vocals are simply stunning. The band just burns as a unit, and for a moment or two, it feels as if the charts have been burned and they are on the wire without a net. Two other bonus tracks are included (they were recorded for the original Seeger Sessions offering but not included on the final CD). They are Live in Dublin takes of John Hurley's and Ronnie Wilkins' \"Love of the Common People\" and \"We Shall Overcome.\" These feel like they add something to the sense of heritage that initially gave birth to the Seeger Sessions project. \"We Shall Overcome\" is a defining moment here. Introduced by Springsteen as: \"This is the kinda the song that got us started here, so uh...\"; it's a soft-spoken element of surprise that closes the entire release with a moving and even spiritual sense of dignity. It is also the only song here that doesn't feel like a number Springsteen has remade in his own musical image.For many listeners, this will seem like a wild celebration, yet all the polish and glimmer this band displays — perhaps unavoidable after such a long run playing together — feels very different, not distant so much involved in the song as in the performance. It feels like a recording that doesn't resemble the songs of the \"people\" any longer, but more like another live — and far more musically adventurous — Bruce Springsteen record. Not that there is anything wrong with that at all. It simply means that what was mercurial and puzzling and sometimes even maddening about The Seeger Sessions as an album feels defined and perhaps even actually finished here. Not just the in the sense of the band being at the end of a tour, either; it could be, perhaps, the end of a phase in his career (the jury is out on that for now), but more likely, that with Live in Dublin, something is lost as well as gained: it feels as if all of these songs as performed on this set — not just the ones Springsteen penned — have now become part of his catalog rather than part of his repertoire. While these songs have been part of a standard repertoire for many artists and front porch singers, they've never felt \"owned\" by anyone before now. Here, Springsteen owns them. [In addition to the double-CD version is a CD/DVD deluxe version that was filmed in high definition. Containing all 23 performances and a choice of Dolby Digital Surround or PCM sound, the bonus track performances are included as a separate chapter, along with a replica of the set list.]</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>Hailed as Bruce Springsteen's return to rock upon its release in fall 2007, Magic isn't quite as straightforward as that description would have it seem. True, this does mark another reunion with the E Street Band, only his second studio album with the group since 1984's Born in the U.S.A., giving this a rock & roll heft missing from his two previous albums &mdash;the dusty, literary Devils & Dust and the raucous We Shall Overcome: The Pete Seeger Sessions &mdash;and unlike The Rising, the first E Street Band album of the new millennium, there is no overarching theme here. It's just a collection of songs, something that Bruce hasn't done since Human Touch, or maybe even The River. All the ingredients are in place for a simple, straight-ahead rock album, except for two things: Springsteen didn't write a lot of flat-out rock songs, and with his producer Brendan O'Brien, he didn't make an album that sounds much like a rock & roll album, either. Magic is bright and punchy, a digital-age production through and through, right down to how each track feels as if it were crafted according to its own needs instead of the record as a whole.</p><p>Underneath this shiny veneer, the E Street Band can still lift this music toward great heights, infusing it with a sense of majesty, but this is an E Street Band that was recorded piecemeal in the studio, pasted together track by track as the group fit sessions into their busy schedules. This approach gives the album a bit of a mannered, meticulous sound not unlike The Rising, but such careful construction was appropriate for Springsteen's cautious, caring 9/11 rumination; on Magic it tends to keep the music from reaching full flight. Then again, the songs here don't quite lend themselves to either the transcendent sweep of Born to Run or the down-n-dirty roadhouse rockers that cluttered The River. There's a quiet melancholy underpinning this album. It's evident even on the hard-driving \"Radio Nowhere,\" whose charging guitars mask a sense of desperation, or the deceptively breezy \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\" which grows more wistful with each passing chorus. \"Girls\" is also indicative of how Magic doesn't quite feel like classic E Street Band, even when it offers reminders of their classic sound: like \"Born to Run,\" it trades upon Phil Spector, but here the band doesn't absorb the Wall of Sound; they evoke it, giving the song a nostalgic bent that emphasizes the soft sadness in his melody. This oddly bittersweet vibe that is shared by \"Your Own Worst Enemy,\" whose baroque harpsichords &mdash;uncannily reminiscent of the Left Banke &mdash;are the biggest curveball here.</p><p>That is, it's the biggest specific curveball outside of the overall feel of Magic, which is far too somber to be called just another rock & roll album. The solemn, sepia-toned picture of the Boss on the cover is a pretty big tip-off that there may not be a whole lot of good times coming on Magic, but it's a surprise that this is not only not as joyous as We Shall Overcome, it doesn't have as many moments of sunny relief as The Rising, which had \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\" and \"Mary's Place\" among its quiet, artful grief. Here, the joy and the sadness are fused, skewing such otherwise lively numbers as \"Livin' in the Future\" &mdash;which otherwise sounds like it could sneak onto the second side of Born in the U.S.A. &mdash;toward the sober side. Springsteen also targets war and politics throughout the album, either through metaphors (the title track, where the audience is suckered by a con man) or blunt declarations (\"Last to Die\"). All this toil and tension doesn't make for a very fun album, but 2007 isn't a very fun time, so it's an appropriate reflection of the time. The thing of it is, despite some fine moments of craft &mdash;both musical and lyrical, whether on \"Gypsy Biker\" or \"Long Walk Home\" &mdash;the songs aren't written with the keen literary eye that made Devils & Dust play like a collection of short stories. Like the music, the words just feel a shade too deliberate, rendering Magic just a bit too overthought &mdash;hardly enough to make for a bad record, but one that isn't quite grabbing, even if it is helped immeasurably by the E Street Band in old pro mode. And what's missing comes into sharp relief as the album draws to a close with \"Terry's Song,\" a quickly written and recorded tribute to Terry Magovern, Springsteen's longtime friend and assistant. Compared to the rest of the album, this simple tune is a bit ragged, but it's soulful, moving, and indelible, immediate where the rest of the album is a shade distant. After hearing it, it's hard not to wish that Bruce would record this way all the time.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><p>Bruce Springsteen occupies a unique place in American popular culture. He doesn't have the cachet that Bob Dylan has, yet he's much more approachable&mdash;populist in practice, not just in theory. He has inspired pale imitators (Tom Petty, John Mellencamp), but has no peers to speak of. Unlike similar 1980s supercelebrities Prince or Madonna, he remains artistically viable and culturally relevant two decades after the height of his popularity. In the 1970s, he was never hip, but in the 2000s he has gained a considerable following among indie rock bands like the Hold Steady, the Killers, and the National, among many others. Because his music has lost none of its triumphant rock'n'roll kick&mdash;no matter how many times you hear it, \"Born to Run\" always kills&mdash;he has become today what Brian Wilson was 10 years ago: the indie ideal.</p><p>And yet, his popularity extends far beyond the indie realm. His mainstream audience remains fanatically loyal, making him one of the few artists that both you and your boss enjoy. Springsteen's success continues despite the constantly shifting ground that finds him on one side of certain cultural and political lines, then on another. His 2002 album The Rising was received as a post-9/11 salve, a paean to American resilience in the face of tragedy: The same people who died or lost loved ones in the attacks&mdash;cops, firefighters, corporate grunts, their wives, husbands, families&mdash;were said to be the very same people who inhabited Springsteen's earlier songs, now facing hard, cold reality. So it's forgivable if many heard the album they believed the country needed instead of the one Springsteen actually made.</p><p>Despite the nickname, the Boss has never inhabited his iconic status comfortably. Devils &amp; Dust followed The Rising in 2005*,* trading the E Street Band's full sound for acoustic contemplation and spinning a much grimmer version of America that was full of unrealized dreams and insoluble injustices. We Shall Overcome, his album of Pete Seeger covers and his best late-career album, proved much subtler in its subversiveness, communicating an anti-establishment stance through decades-old tunes. That's nothing new for him: The E Street Band's enormous, exuberant rock'n'roll has always hidden darker currents of American realism, most famously on \"Born in the U.S.A.\", a song about disillusioned Vietnam vets that was hilariously co-opted by Ronald Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign as a theme song.</p><p>That's the secret power of Magic, Springsteen's 15th album in 34 years: The album hides its raw disillusionment deep within the music, mingling it with a weary optimism and a thoroughly committed lustiness that have not diminished with age. The result is a surprisingly complex album that recalls The River in its heartfelt populism, Darkness on the Edge of Town in its small-town scope, and Tunnel of Love in its mature take on love and sex. On \"I'll Work for Your Love\", which could be a cover of an outtake from the first half of The River, he tells a woman he's \"counting the bones in your back like the stations of the cross\"&mdash;a concise fusion of the sexual and the spiritual. Where he once chronicled youthful abandon in the face of life's possibility, now his subject is the wonders of middle-aged contentment, as if he can't believe his own luck. It's a surprisingly durable subject, one that fits his outsize sound perfectly.</p><p>On the other hand, Springsteen's prickly angst makes songs like \"Last to Die\" and \"You'll Be Comin' Down\" sound like challenges to, rather than platitudes for, regular Joes. On second single \"Long Walk Home\", he considers the small(-town) satisfaction of having distinctive local landmarks and knowing everyone you pass on the street. That such pleasures are slowly dying makes the song both a romanticizing ode to an American ideal that may never have existed as well as a clear-headed lament that we no longer yearn for those securities. \"You know that flag flying over the courthouse means certain things are set in stone,\" he sings, \"who we are, what we'll do and what we won't.\"</p><p>If Magic revisits the subject matter of previous career crests, it unfortunately recalls The Rising in its sound: Brendan O'Brien returns to the producer's seat, once again shuffling most of the E Street Band to the music's margins and focusing his attention squarely on the Boss. In addition to drenching slower songs like \"Your Own Worst Enemy\" and \"Devil's Arcade\" in melodramatic and totally unnecessary strings, the producer too often glosses over the creaks and wear in Springsteen's voice&mdash;like air-brushing a model's face to look younger&mdash;when it's the imperfections that give him his particular authority. Springsteen should sound more like Tom Waits, less like 3 Doors Down.</p><p>But then there are the songs that get everything exactly right, like the gorgeous \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\" and \"Livin' in the Future\". On the latter, the E Street Band are given freer rein to revive and even update the boardwalk strut and namesake shuffle of their early days. Clarence Clemons' sax is integral to the modified doo-wop groove, drummer Max Weinberg swings easily, guitarists Steve Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren trade out licks, and Patti Scialfa's tender vocals echo Springsteen's excited performance. While he doesn't have the youthful eye for detail and narrative he once had, Springsteen's more concise songwriting style allows for some nice observations and surprisingly playful comparisons. \"Then just about sundown, you come walkin' through town,\" he sings on \"Livin' in the Future\", \"your boot heels clicking like the barrel of a pistol spinning 'round.\" He&mdash;and the E Street Band&mdash;actually sound hungry and, yes, just a little pissed off. It's an angry song, with a rumbling undercurrent of dread (\"Woke up Election Day, sky's gunpowder and shades of gray\"), but damn if it doesn't sound awesome when you're speeding down a back road with the windows rolled down.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M.

Viewers are able to see Springsteen spontaneously directing the E Street Band and shaping the show as it evolves. The set list spans from 'Born To Run' era to 'Working On a Dream' and includes rare covers such as The Clash's \"London Calling,\" Jimmy Cliff's \"Trapped,\" The Young Rascals' \"Good Lovin',\" and Eddie Floyd's \"Raise Your Hand.\" Springsteen also performs fan favorite \"Hard Times (Come Again No More),\" written by Stephen Foster in 1854. Brian Fallon from The Gaslight Anthem joins the band as a guest vocalist on Springsteen's own \"No Surrender.\" GRAMMY and Emmy Award-winning producer and editor Thom Zimny and director Chris Hilson, both members of Springsteen's video team dating back over a decade, oversaw the film. Audio was mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Bonus material includes stunning footage of \"The River\" from Glastonbury, June 27; and the full music video for \"Wrecking Ball,\" filmed at New Jersey's Giants Stadium.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Amazon</strong></p><hr /><p>Highly anticipated by fans of The Boss, and those who track high-profile concert DVDs generally, the new release from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is a hot and sweaty rock 'n' roll spectacle, just in time for summer in the city.<p>London Calling Live In Hyde Park documents the band's showcase last summer in London's central public green space - the equivalent of New York City's Central Park. Even by big event standards, this is an oversized gig — the London crowd stretches on for what seems like miles, and Bruce and the band are clearly in outdoor festival mode.</p><p>Mr. Springsteen is legendary, of course, for outsized concert events, and his stamina as a performer is ridiculous. Three-hour concerts are the norm for the E Street crew, and they don't disappoint here - the 2-DVD set clocks in at just under 180 minutes, counting the included pair of extra tracks (\"The River\" from the previous night's warm-up gig, and the music video for \"Wrecking Ball.\")</p><p>In fact, the show outlasts the sun, beginning in broad daylight and proceeding through a gorgeous sunset at Hyde Park. As the last numbers wind down in the blue glow of London twilight, it becomes clear that this is a genius move on the part of the producers. Mother Nature provides a better light show that any team of technicians could have wired.</p><p>Springsteen kicks off the show with a relatively faithful cover of the Clash's immortal call-to-arms \"London Calling.\" Pulling at the song's insistent, staccato chords, Springsteen gives early notice that he's not horsing around. It's an odd sight to see Springsteen signing those famous lines about nuclear errors and London drowning, but it works. If he can't quite match the snarling intensity of Joe Strummer's original vocals — well, he very nearly does, and that counts for something.</p><p>The set list from here bounces all around, with numbers going back to the Born to Run era all the way up through the latest album, Working on a Dream. Besides the opening Clash number, Bruce peppers in a few more covers, including \"Good Lovin',\" Jimmy Cliff's \"Trapped,\" and the traditional ballad \"Hard Times (Come Again No More).\"</p><p>Highlights abound. On \"Youngstown,\" Bruce evokes his trademark vibe of sepia-toned Americana, and it makes you think: It's kind of nice to have these guys in Europe, doing their thing. On balance, it's fair to say that Springsteen is one of our very best cultural ambassadors of the last several decades. Later in the show, when he digs into the nostalgic \"Glory Days,\" the feeling comes again: This is the image of America we would like to be exporting, instead of wars and oil spills and whatever bobblehead tweenage pop stars Hollywood is pushing this season.</p><p>In his jeans and work shirt (with the sleeves rolled up, of course), Springsteen sells the common-man thing like no one else. He may also be the only blue-collar guy that can wear a soul patch convincingly. Cynics sometimes point to his overall image as  shtick , but I'm not buying.</p><p>When Springsteen dons a cowboy hat for \"Outlaw Pete,\" and kneels down to relate to the crowd in a raspy voice, you remember what a surpassing storyteller and flat-out showman he is. Nice, too, that in quieter moments like these, the terrific audio brings out every nuance of the accompanying musicians (in this case, Soozie Tyrell on violin). Audio overall is superlative, and is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound or PCM Stereo.</p><p>The stage setup is designed to accommodate such moments, projecting to the back seats while still providing some intimacy. The high platform main stage connects via a set of steps to a catwalk skirting the front rows. At one point, Springsteen comes down to the catwalk and gathers all the signs of song requests from the crowd.</p><p>Springsteen talks about this evolving tradition at his shows in an interview on the promotional trailer for the DVD.</p><p>\"Somewhere along the line, the fans got the idea that if they brought their signs, they were going to have a higher lobbying potential to hear their songs of choice,\" he says. \"For us, it becomes like \"Stump the Band.\" It tests the E Street archives a little, you know.\"</p><p>Sure enough, about halfway through the set Springsteen gathers the stack of requests and puts them on stage. As the show progresses, he grabs a song title off the stack — \"Bobby Jean\" — and cues the band by literally waving the sign at them. It adds a nice sense of spontaneity to the proceedings.</p><p>Other of Springsteen's dusty rock moves are less engaging. I understand some stage antics are so traditional there's no point in fighting them, but I feel like I've been watching Springsteen and sidekick Stevie Van Zandt share a microphone for most of my adult life. Can't we all pitch in and get Stevie his own mic?</p><p>All the other E Street regulars are on hand as well, including Nils Lofgren on guitar and Max Weinberg on drums. And of course few sounds in creation are as instantly recognizable as Clarence Clemons' saxophone.</p><p>And now, a word about sweat. According to accounts from attendees, it was a particularly warm summer evening when they filmed this show in London. Springsteen has huge circles under his arms by the middle of the second song, \"Badlands.\" By the time he's in \"Youngstown,\" halfway though the first set, he's thoroughly drenched and literally flinging perspiration with every strum. It's amazing, really. Dude is 60 years old!</p><p>Bruce isn't afraid to make the occasional joke at the expense of his veteran status, either. At one point, he pretends to collapse coming up those steps. And check out his farewell shout-out to the crowd. Which of these items is not like the others?</p><p>\"London! You've just seen the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, hard-rocking, earth-shocking, booty-shaking, love-making, Viagra-taking, history-making, legendary E Street Band!\"</p><p>No two ways about it; Springsteen knows how to work a crowd. In what may be the show's most powerful moment, he goes into preacher man mode, pacing the stage as he promises to build — for a couple hours at least, here in Hyde Park —\"a house of hope and joy in a world of fear and despair.\" As the band vamps behind him, Revered Bruce delivers the good word: \"We're going to bring down the power of music on ya!\"</p><p>It's heartening somehow to hear the power of rock so earnestly invoked, seeing as we're near 50 years past from the high tide of the 1960s. Since that moment when, as Hunter Thompson so devastatingly put it, \"the wave finally broke and rolled back.\"</p><p>Well, take heart, brethren. The Boss, at least, is still doing what he can.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Glenn McDonald</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>From its bright, brittle production to its tossed-off postage stamp cover art, Working on a Dream is in every respect a companion piece to Magic, an album that's merely a set of songs, both sprawling and deliberately small, songs that don't necessarily tackle any one major theme but all add up to a portrait of their time. Magic chronicled the dog days of Bush where Working on a Dream is designed as a keynote to the Obama age, released just a week after the inauguration of the U.S.'s 44th president and not coincidentally containing not a little optimism within its 13 tracks. This sense of hope is a tonic to the despair that crept into the margins of Magic but it's easy to posit Working on a Dream as pure positivity, which isn't exactly true: a hangover from W lingers, most vividly in the broken spirit of \"The Wrestler,\" and Bruce mourning departed E Street Band member Danny Federici with \"The Last Carnival.\" Springsteen peppers his tribute with assets/images recalling the early days of the E Street Band but saves a revival of their wild, woolly sound for the opening \"Outlaw Pete,\" a cavernous, circular, comical epic reminiscent of Springsteen's unwieldy portraits of rats on the Jersey Shore. \"Outlaw Pete\" is Working on a Dream at its best, playing like nothing less than The E Street Shuffle as reflected and refracted through Arcade Fire's naked hero worship, casually highlighting how producer Brendan O'Brien has gently nudged the Boss toward new musical avenues.</p><p>Many of these new sounds are drawn from the past, often feeling informed by Little Steven's Underground Garage -- Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren's guitars chime like the Byrds; the band knocks out a tough little blues number on \"Good Eye\"; and Springsteen shows a knack for pure pop on \"Surprise, Surprise\" and indulges his ever-increasing Brian Wilson fascination on \"This Life,\" whose percolating organs and harmonies rival the High Llamas. All this rests nicely alongside the Boss' trademarks -- galloping rockers that fill a stadium (\"My Lucky Day\") and their polar opposite, his intimate acoustic tunes (\"Tomorrow Never Knows\") -- which all make Working on a Dream read like a rich, inventive, musical album...which it is, to an extent. The ideas and intent are there, but the album is hampered slightly by the overall modesty of Springsteen's writing -- by and large, these are small-scale songs and feel that way -- and hurt significantly by the precise, digital production that muffles the music's imagination and impact. A large part of Springsteen's appeal has always been how the E Street Band has sounded as big and open as his heart, but Working on a Dream, like Magic before it, has a production that feels tiny and constrained even as it is layered with extraneous details. It's possible to listen around this production and hear the modest charms of the songs, but the album would be better if the sound matched the sentiment.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><p>Working on a Streak is more like it. First, there's that Golden Globe for \"The Wrestler\", then a performance at the We Are One concert at the Lincoln Memorial, a handful of Grammy noms for a two-year-old song, a greatest-hits package exclusive from Wal-Mart, this weekend's Super Bowl halftime show, and a just-announced reissue of Darkness on the Edge of Town. So that Oscar snub can't sting too much. In the middle of a pretty amazing month, Bruce Springsteen is releasing his 16th studio album, one whose title sounds more like a campaign slogan than a rock record. Maybe that's intentional: After spending much of this decade playing up to listeners' notions of post-9/11 recovery and conjuring up bleak visions of Bush-era America, the Boss settles into some sense of contentment on Working on a Dream, as if that Dream had already been achieved. In this regard, the album sounds like the final installment of a trilogy he began with The Rising in 2002 and continued with Magic in 2007&mdash;ignoring Devils & Dust, which isn't hard to do, and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, which remains his best and most freewheelin' late-career album.</p><p>Tracing his personal&mdash;and, arguably, our national&mdash;mood from wounded to outraged to somewhat contented, these albums are linked by Springsteen's ongoing collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien, whose work has grown increasingly capable and adventurous with each release. Despite removing any trace of regional shuffle from these songs, O'Brien puts them across like the proficient bar band they are, roaring through \"My Lucky Day\" and \"What Love Can Do\" with professional abandon. O'Brien erects an impressive 1960s wall of sound on \"Surprise, Surprise\", with its carnivalesque organ and girl-group backing vocals, and in general he streamlines the E Street Band's sound to highlight one central melody or riff. Opener \"Outlaw Pete\" rides an ascending/descending theme not dissimilar to KISS' \"I Was Made for Loving You\". Strings protrude from the song at odd angles, Springsteen's vocals echo through what sounds like a deep valley, and Roy Bittan contributes a hyperactive organ as the song spins a yarn about an outlaw so vague he sounds only theoretical. The track is overstuffed with ideas, and at eight minutes, it's a strange, ineffective opener, setting a curiously detached mood for an album that is, for Springsteen, typically engaged.</p><p>Of his three E Street Band releases of the 00's, Working on a Dream is the one that most sounds like a solo album, indulging a range of ideas that reveal Springsteen as still musically curious and more than willing to play around with his sound. Another American rock saint&mdash;Brian Wilson&mdash;shows up in the walking bass line on the title track as well as in the Pet Sounds percussion and ba-ba-ba's of \"This Life\". The scribbly guitar on \"Life Itself\" recalls the Byrds on \"Eight Miles High\" more than Nils Lofgren or Steve Van Zandt, providing a tense backdrop for Springsteen's pleading lyrics. The garbled-blues \"Good Eye\", one of the album's weirdest tracks, ratchets Springsteen's distorted vocals to a yelping beat and electrified banjo, but like his recent one-off download \"A Night With the Jersey Devil\", it feels like merely a demonstration of studio technique.</p><p>Working on a Dream works hard on sound, but sleeps on actual songs. \"Queen of the Supermarket\" may be the worst thing he's ever written, an overly symphonic ballad about crushing on the stock girl. It's sweet, but there's something about the high-flying strings and the intensity of the imagery (\"A dream awaits in aisle number two\") that suggests parody. The checkout beeps that help the song out to its car certainly don't dispel the wink. \"At night I take my groceries and drift away,\" Springsteen sings, but here his working-class identifications sound a little condescending and inappropriate. Just as \"57 Channels (And Nothing On)\" failed to convince anyone that Springsteen watched a lot of TV, \"Queen of the Supermarket\" can't persuade listeners that he does his own grocery shopping. Now that his big dream has come true, Springsteen doesn't seem to know what to do with himself. So he's trying to do everything.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story is a three-CD/three-DVD deluxe collection that includes a completely remastered version of the Darkness album and two more discs entitled The Promise, containing 21 unreleased songs recorded during the period.</p><p>The remastered version of the album by Bob Ludwig is sonically righteous; it resists the temptation of the era's technology to make everything sound flat. Its dynamics and warmth mirror those on the original vinyl edition. The two discs of unreleased material (available separately as well) offer an aural view as to what might have happened had Springsteen been able to record immediately after Born to Run. (He was barred from doing so for two years due to a lawsuit with his former manager.) While many lyric themes here reflect the brokenness and hard choices found on Darkness, others sound more triumphant. All of these songs contain a more maximal attitude in production. They also lack the knife-edge, searing, angry guitar work that saturates Darkness. Included are his versions of singles farmed out to other artists -- \"Because the Night\" (and while this version is terrific, it means something else in the end; Patti Smith's remains definitive) and the soulful, gritty \"Fire\" given to the Pointer Sisters. \"Gotta Get That Feeling\" summons Jack Nitzsche's production ears with its big mariachi brass. Many others openly recall Phil Spector's \"sha-na-na-na\" backing choruses. Clarence Clemons' saxophone is much more prevalent here than on Darkness. His meaty tone adds heft and groove to these songs. \"Ain't Good Enough for You\" is pure handclap, call-and-response, verse-and-chorus joy, approaching a doo wop celebration. The poignant love poetry in \"The Brokenhearted\" and \"Spanish Eyes\" could have been written by Doc Pomus, and reveals the influence of Jerry Lieber's \"Spanish Harlem.\" \"Candy's Boy\" begins lyrically in the same place as \"Candy's Room,\" but becomes a very different song. \"Racing in the Street\" contains some different words and David Lindley's violin makes the track a bit less personal, more anthemic; it's absent the shadow of doubt that makes the Darkness version so emotionally devastating. \"The Promise\" is the only cut that may have added something to Darkness that isn't already there. Its sense of bewilderment, betrayal, uncertainty, and regret is total. That said, the addition of strings draws it outside Darkness' more skeletal purview, underscoring that Darkness is perfect as it is.</p><p>The first of the three DVDs features a full-length documentary directed by Thom Zimny on the making of the album, with fantastic, amazing archival studio and performance video footage by Barry Rebo. The narration by Springsteen and interviews with producer Jon Landau, bandmembers, Patti Smith, engineer Jimmy Iovine, and even Mike Appel provide an intimate look at an intense and often frustrating period in the career of Springsteen & the E Street Band. The viewer can feel the places where confusion reigned given the sheer amount of material -- over 70 songs were written and demoed; piles of notebooks from which song lyrics and ideas were cobbled are perched everywhere. The fact that a single album came from this mountain is amazing in itself; that Darkness on the Edge of Town emerged is a miracle. The second DVD here contains a complete 2009 performance of the album at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, NJ on the first half. While the performance is flawless and stirring, the lack of interaction with an audience feels a bit strange. That said, hearing Springsteen play the hell out of his guitar again, making it scream and snarl as it did during the tour for Darkness, is not only welcome, but akin to the sound of an old friend’s voice after a prolonged absence. Bob Clearmountain's mix is stellar. The band's instinctive playing is tight and intuitive. The rest of the disc features footage from the Thrill Hill Vault, including rehearsal footage, recording snippets, and some concert performances from New Jersey, New York, and Phoenix from the tour. The final DVD is a complete three-hour concert by Springsteen & the E Street Band from Houston in 1978. It’s called a “bootleg cut” on the cover for a reason; the video is fine, but the audio is basically board sound and a bit thin. That said, the performance is dynamic and riveting, and only audiophiles are gonna care -- it rocks top to bottom. This box set also includes an 80-page spiral-bound reproduction of Springsteen's notebooks documenting the album sessions, plus an original, insightful essay. It's the ultimate fetish item for hardcore fans and rock historians.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Sometimes reissues add a few demos or outtakes, sometimes they add a bonus disc with a live show or additional music, and sometimes they go so far with the bonus material they become something else entirely. The Promise, a name given to two sets based around unheard music from Bruce Springsteen dating to 1977 and 1978, when he was writing and recording the seminal Darkness on the Edge of Town, doesn't fit easily into typical reissue categories. There's a 2xCD, 3xLP set that contains 22 unreleased songs from the period, and then there's a deluxe box set that augments the unreleased material with a remastered version of Darkness and three DVDs. And the latter is housed in a faux spiral-bound notebook with facsimiles of Springsteen's handwritten studio notes from the time. Taken all together, we're talking 10 hours plus of video and audio, along with the booklet. So calling this a reissue of Darkness on the Edge of Town is not accurate. This is a trove, a vast clearinghouse from a fertile period, the product of which turned out to be one terrific album. And in addition to containing its share of treasure, The Promise ultimately confirms that Springsteen is a brilliant editor of his own material.</p><p>That much is clear when listening to the album itself, which is in danger of being overshadowed by everything released around it. Where the Born to Run box from 2005 looked intently at the album proper (there were few outtakes from those sessions anyway) and portrayed what resulted as a landmark, The Promise focuses on a period of time that produced one memorable album but could have produced others. Much of the material was written when Springsteen was embroiled in a lawsuit with his former manager, and a lot has been made of the impact the legal proceedings were said to have on Springsteen's muse. He made a bleak and bombed-out album, the story goes, because he was feeling lost in the world himself, fearful that he was losing control of his career. And since the lawsuit kept him out of the studio when he wanted so badly to record, he kept piling up songs while he waited for the smoke to clear.</p><p>Even more than the lawsuit, Darkness seems like Springsteen's instinctive recoil from the Born to Run hype. That's partly why he burned to cut another record&mdash;to \"find out what he's got,\" to quote a line from \"Badlands\" that particularly appealed to him. The Promise documentary included with the box, which combines black-and-white video footage taken in the studio while the album was recorded with recent interviews, makes clear that he wanted to make an \"honest\" record that people would take seriously. He was embarrassed by the hype that had put him on the cover of Time and Newsweek simultaneously in 1975, and he didn't want to be the \"next big thing.\"</p><p>Indeed, it's striking just how different Darkness is from its predecessor in tone and theme. Where Born to Run was about drama, with a sense of bombast that pushed past cinematic and wound up somewhere closer to Broadway, Darkness, despite its share of rockers, is about grim acceptance and pressing on in the face of doubt. In \"Racing in the Street\", the bittersweet ballad that ranks with the best songs Springsteen has ever written, the narrator's girlfriend \"Stares off alone into the night/ With the eyes of one who hates for just being born.\" But she's not going anywhere. The darkness that envelops the town keeps the characters in and the rest of the world out. Where the characters in Born to Run were racing against death, the characters here are cursed with the burden of survival. So like all Springsteen records in the early part of his career, there are many songs about cars and driving, but these people seem to be going in circles, idly moving from one place to the next. \"You can ride this road 'til dawn, without another human being in sight,\" goes a line in the richly emotional mid-tempo rocker \"Something in the Night\". With no chance of escape, you have to figure out how to deal with what's in front of you.</p><p>The stark reality of the songs is reinforced by the album's production. Darkness is in its own way as sonically consistent and coherent as Born to Run; but where that album drew inspiration from Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, Darkness tries to do as much as possible with a minimum of embellishment. A few tracks break from this dry and barren template. \"Candy's Room\" and \"Something in the Night\" have the tinkling piano and glockenspiel that might have helped them to fit on Born to Run, while \"Racing in the Street\" has a very particular and hugely effective atmosphere, with just the right touches of reverb and backing vocals to make it sound like an elegy. As for the remastering, I'm not hearing a lot of difference here, but Darkness always sounded good. From the opening drum fill of \"Badlands\" to the grim fade of the title track, there's not a weak song on the album and it deservedly ranks with Springsteen's classics. Which means that it ranks with rock's classic albums, full stop.</p><p>And it took a long time to get it that way. The music on the 2xCD set The Promise, which was written during the Darkness sessions, shows what Springsteen had to leave behind to get the record that he wanted. That meant no big pop songs. There's \"Because the Night\", given to Patti Smith before being completed, which she then improved and turned into her biggest hit. And then \"Fire\", which Springsteen gave to the Pointer Sisters, and which went to No. 2 on Billboard. It also means no songs about easy times, hope, and escape. So \"Gotta Get That Feeling\", an appealing mid-tempo track with horns and sweet backing vocals and lines like \"We ain't got no money but we don't care\" was shelved. (In Darkness, people have no money but they do care, a lot.) And \"Save My Love\", a catchy piano-led tune, isn't going to make Darkness with lines like \"If we open up our hearts/ Love won't forsake us.\" Tell that to the couple in \"Racing in the Street\".</p><p>The Promise is also a good demonstration of how Springsteen mines his unused songs for material, and shows how many ways he tried to record things before figuring out how they worked best. The set kicks off with \"Racing in the Street ('78)\", a version that begins as an austere ballad but builds into a rock song. It's nowhere near as effective as what came to be on the record, but it is riveting, showing just how elastic Springsteen's melodic and thematic ideas could be. An early version of \"Candy's Room\" is here, too, and it's called \"Candy's Boy\"; instead of the original's dark and explosive sensuality, here it's a clean, shuffling guitar-pop tune, charming but without a lot at stake.</p><p>The tracks on The Promise CD aren't left out just because of subject matter or tone&mdash;they also sound different. As with some songs on Tracks, some of these songs had parts added later. \"Where needed, I worked on them to bring them to fruition,\" Springsteen writes in the notes. \"Many stand as they were recorded all those years ago.\" The re-touching is at its most extreme on \"Save My Love\", which was written in the 70s but cut in 2010. In other places, the vocals and music sound fundamentally different from the recordings of the era. Certainly, the arrangements are thicker than what wound up on Darkness, which makes sense since some of the songs left behind were R&B-based bar-band songs and swooning songs of love and lust. Still, despite the lack of consistency, the 22 new songs (there are 21 tracks, but \"The Way\" is a hidden bonus track at the end) are mostly very good and occasionally great. None feel like they should have been on Darkness, but almost all of them hold up to repeat plays and stand on their own as very good Springsteen&mdash;easily on the level of mid-level stuff on The River, say.</p><p>On the visual side, one DVD has a bizarre recording of Springsteen and the E Street Band playing Darkness on the Edge of Town straight through in an empty theater in Asbury Park in December 2009. I suspect that this decision was inspired in part by the notion that the album is about loneliness and open spaces, but there's something off about seeing this band, known so well for its deep connection to its audience, playing by themselves in a large room without people.</p><p>More interesting on the same disc are the live odds-and-ends from rehearsals at Springsteen's rented Jersey home in the 70s. The band is packed into what looks like a small bedroom, Springsteen is shirtless, with the familiar guitar around his neck, standing before a microphone taped to a stand. And the band is running through a couple new songs in an intimate space with no sense at all of posterity. (They are so casual, Steve Van Zant isn't even wearing a hat!) Also on this disc are songs from a 1978 show in Phoenix, including the famous clip for \"Rosalita\" that got some play in the early days of MTV. These Phoenix performances are generally superior to the three-hour set from a 1978 show in Houston included on a separate DVD. The video comes from the arena's video feed and, given the quality of video in 1978, quality could be better. But it is a multi-camera shoot with good coverage and Springsteen and the E Street band were in amazing form throughout that year. So no complaints about more live Springsteen.</p><p>Which leaves the documentary, which in one sense serves as the centerpiece of the project. As with the film included with the Born to Run box, there are interesting details about the technical aspects of the album. Chuck Plotkin's theory behind his approach to mixing vocals is fascinating, and explains why this album feels so balanced. We see fragments of songs, lots of exhaustion and sitting around, and get a look at how Springsteen works as a bandleader. There's a moment in the first scene where he looks tired and frustrated and a little pissed off and you realize that it would be scary to have him mad at you. He's not always an easy guy to work for. It's refreshing to see such a simple display of humanity when the documentary obviously has very specific points that it wants to hit.</p><p>Still, there's something odd about these \"making of\" documentaries about albums coming from the artist themselves. In part because they seem so intent on directing how the music is heard. Sets like this and Neil Young's Archives reflect a desire for artists to take control of their legacy and shape the narrative of their careers. It's easy to understand this impulse, and doubly so when you are talking about people as controlling as Springsteen or Neil Young. And yet it's also futile. As listeners, our stories are what will ultimately matter, and by having the music in our lives, we give it significance and form. Darkness is the kind of record you sink into, an album of power and dignity and loss and just a hint at the possibility of transcendence, which is something Springsteen's fans have known all along, even without hearing a single detail of how it is made. We'll take it all and have loads of fun exploring all the ephemera, but Springsteen carved through all this&mdash;the pile of songs, the legal bullshit, the media image he wasn't comfortable with&mdash;to make that one magical record, which is the most impressive part of it all.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>There isn't another Bruce Springsteen album like High Hopes. Cobbled together from covers -- of other songwriters along with the Boss himself (\"American Skin [41 Shots]\" and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" are both revived) -- and outtakes from the last decade, High Hopes doesn't have the cohesion or gilded surfaces of Wrecking Ball, but neither is it quite a clearinghouse of leftovers. Inspired in part by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who has proven to be a brother in arms to Springsteen, as well as a substitute for Steven Van Zandt in the E-Street Band, High Hopes certainly bears the proud stamp of Morello, both in its workingman's politics and in its cinematic sound. Much of this record oscillates between the moody and militant, particularly in the politically charged numbers, which are often colored by percussive guitar squalls. Here, the RATM guitarist often resembles a Nils Lofgren stripped of blues or lyricism -- think of the gusts of noise on \"Tunnel of Love\" without any melodicism -- and that's a bracing change for Springsteen, who has shown interest in atmospherics but usually when they're coming from keyboards, not six strings. Such sociological talk suggests High Hopes is nothing but rallying cries and downhearted laments, but the fascinating thing about this unkempt collection is how these protest songs and workingman's anthems are surrounded by intimate tunes, ranging from a cover of the Saints' latter-day \"Just Like Fire Would\" to a strangely soothing interpretation of Suicide's \"Dream Baby Dream.\" Morello reportedly had as much to do with the inclusion of these covers as he did with the record's set pieces -- a stirring \"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\" \"American Skin\" (which can't help but seem like a reference to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin in this context), and \"High Hopes,\" a Tim Scott McConnell song first recorded in the '90s -- and there's a certain sober passion that ties all these songs together but, in turn, it makes the rest of the record all the more compelling because the pieces simply don't fit. There's the rousing Gaelic rock of \"This Is Your Sword,\" sounding a bit like a rejected closing credit theme for The Wire; \"Down in the Hole,\" which rides the same train-track rhythm as \"I'm on Fire;\" the complicated waltz of \"Hunter of Invisible Game,\" softer and stranger than much of the rest here; \"Harry's Place,\" a bit of synthesized Sopranos noir that sounds much older than its ten years; and the absolutely glorious \"Frankie Fell in Love,\" as open-hearted and romantic a song as Springsteen has ever written. Strictly speaking, these 12 songs don't cohere into a mood or narrative but after two decades of deliberate, purposeful albums, it's rather thrilling to hear Springsteen revel in a mess of contradictions.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><p>Back in 2000, Bruce Springsteen debuted a new song called \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" at a concert in Atlanta. It was, he claimed, inspired by the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times when four New York City police officers mistook his wallet for a gun. The song was a deeply empathetic response to the tragedy, as a famous rock star tried to see the world from the point of view of both the police officers who work rough neighborhoods and the African American residents who find themselves in danger for even the most harmless actions. Even before many people had actually heard it, \"American Skin\" sparked controversy, as New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Chief Howard Safir publically condemned both the singer and the song. Particularly egregious was the reaction of Bob Lucente, the head of the State Fraternal Order of Police, who called Springsteen both a \"dirtbag\" and a \"floating fag.\"</p><p>For his part, Springsteen weathered the uproar stoically. He explained in interviews that the song wasn't necessarily anti-cop, but he didn't shy away from making it a permanent addition to his setlists during that tour. A studio version was released to radio stations, but the song wasn't available commercially until the following year, when it appeared at the beginning of disc two of 2001's Live in New York City. In the decade since, it has collected dust as a footnote in Springsteen's late-career catalog&mdash;a reminder, when you needed one, that he could still write a powerful and topical song. In 2009, however, he revived \"American Skin\" and began dedicating performances to Trayvon Martin, and that sad new relevance is ostensibly the reason the song appears on Springsteen's 18th album, High Hopes, a collection of new recordings of songs that he has been playing for 10 or 12 years. Essentially these are all outtakes from The Rising, Magic, and Working on a Dream**, but Springsteen re-recorded them with producer Ron Aniello and sequenced them into a standalone album.</p><p>The Boss has a famously deep archive of quality songs from throughout his career, so there's no reason to scoff at the concept behind High Hopes. Fans have been bootlegging these songs for years now, which means the album is aptly titled: There are high hopes for studio versions of almost all of these songs, especially \"American Skin\". The new version, though, has stiff competition. The performance on Live in New York City gains its power from the concert setting, with the E Street Band alternating vocals to create a sense of community and Clarence Clemons' sax solo sounding like a heartfelt eulogy. The studio version from 2001 duplicates that arrangement, only without Springsteen telling the crowd, \"We need a little quiet.\"</p><p>But, unfortunately, the High Hopes recording of \"American Skin\" highlights everything that's gone wrong with Springsteen's music in the 21st century. It's garish and melodramatic, with a cluttered arrangement and slick production that distracts from its message. The song open with Springsteen singing \"41 shots,\" but his vocals are distorted and distant--a cheap effect. There is some industrial percussion that would have sounded dated in 2000, and there is Tom Morello's guitar solo, which could have been cribbed from some third-tier 80s power ballad. In 2013, the song is too aware of its own import, which means it strains for the same sense of gravity that once came easily. Live, Springsteen was able to play up the contradictions and colliding perspectives fueling the country's race problems, even implicating himself in the process, but now his outrage has curdled into something like dulled resignation.</p><p>Springsteen has struggled in the 2000's to find the best musical vehicle for his thoughts on the state of America. Live, the E Street Band can be a powerhouse, as the sexagenarian continues to exude charisma and energy on stage. The studio, however, is another thing. Nebraska aside, Springsteen has never been a minimalist, but his recent output has been maximalist in all the wrong directions. Rather than the Spectorian wall of sound he perfected on Born to Run and The River, he now dabbles in studio gimmicks that sound both expensive and dated: vocal distortion, caked-on production, pots-and-pans percussion, inert drum loops, a puzzling fascination with Celtic flourishes. On High Hopes the thick arrangements distract from the good songwriting and conceal the bad, often to the extent that it's impossible to discern which is which.</p><p>The result is an album that often sounds salvageable but continually trips over its own ambitions and good intentions. On \"Heaven's Wall\" the gospel choir overwhelms the song completely, disrupting the careful cadence of the verses and any nuance the lyrics might carry; rather than righteous, it comes across as self-righteous. \"Harry's Place\" is all setting and no story, with details borrowed from an Elmore Leonard novel. Most tragic may be the closing cover of Suicide's \"Dream Baby Dream\", which begins promisingly with Springsteen's gravelly voice and an accordion mimicking the New York duo's gutter drone. It's a quietly powerful moment, but you just know he's going to do something to ruin it. And sure enough the song builds to a manufactured climax full of corny drum loops and gloppy strings.</p><p>Springsteen is too much of a control freak to escape blame, but perhaps most culpable is Tom Morello, who is apparently a member of the E Street Band now. For the last few years Morello has grown seemingly embarrassed by his rap-rock history with Rage Against the Machine, when making his guitar sound like a turntable carried some cultural weight. He does share with Springsteen a few populist heroes, namely Woody Guthrie and John Steinbeck. Otherwise, they apparently have little in common beyond their politics, and Morello sounds awkwardly fitted to these songs. He shreds gracelessly through the cover of the Havalinas' \"High Hopes\" and clutters \"Heaven's Wall\" with squall and distortion. When his guitar isn't disruptive, it's simply superfluous. Often it's just dumbfounding: his solos on \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\"&mdash;which gets a passable cock-rock makeover that owes a debt to Rage Against the Machine's cover&mdash;sound like David Gilmour sitting in with Cinderella.</p><p>An unwelcome presence, Morello is simply the most obvious of many elements on High Hopes that just don't work. It's all the more unfortunate given that there are actually some redeemable songs here, along with some brief glimpses of Springsteen the rock'n'roll storyteller. Even as he eclipses 60, he's one of the few rock veterans still concerned with actually rocking, which he does convincingly on \"Just Like Fire Would\" and \"Frankie Fell in Love\"&mdash;two negligible songs that you might dismiss on a better album. Here they sound actually feisty and even ribald, with a fire that is squelched on the more serious numbers. I can't tell if those highs actually redeem the album somewhat or make it even more of a disappointment, but I do know that the out-in-the-streets details of \"Frankie Fell in Love\" are more humane and meaningful than the grandiose philosophizing of \"Hunter of Invisible Game\". Instead of trying so hard to live up to the times, perhaps he just needs to work on capturing a moment.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Bruce Springsteen's ambition is his blessing and his curse. He's always believed that rock & roll is a music that can express people's deepest hopes and dreams and change their lives, and his best work communicates that brilliantly. But Springsteen often seems to doubt his own abilities and struggles under the weight of his own (high) standards, and many of Springsteen's best albums were painstakingly created as he spent months in the studio, searching for the right set of songs and performances that would tell the larger story in his mind. Springsteen is too smart to believe you can will a masterpiece into creation, but he does have a work ethic that suggests nothing worthwhile comes without sweat and sore muscles, and the man who regularly plays energetic three-hour shows has never hesitated to do whatever it takes to get the details just right in the studio, even if the desire is to create something that sounds explosive and spontaneous. After taking his early urban folk tales of cars and girls as far as he could on Born to Run, Springsteen took a long, hard look at the lives of those same kids, now saddled with adult responsibilities and realizing that the American Dream was increasingly out of their grasp, on 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town.</p><p>With 1980's The River, Springsteen sought to expand on those themes while also offering more of the tough, bar-band rock that was his trademark (and often conspicuous in its absence on Darkness), and by the time it was released it had swelled into Springsteen's first two-LP set. After presenting his fans with a grand-scale study of how Darkness on the Edge of Town came into being on the 2010 box set The Promise, Springsteen does the same for The River with The Ties That Bind: The River Collection, which features a newly remastered edition of the original album along with a bonus disc of outtakes (most previously unreleased) and an early single-LP version of the album that Springsteen opted not to release because it failed to tell the story he had envisioned. The short version sounds like the rough draft that it is, though it also includes several songs that didn't appear on the longer final version (\"Loose Ends\" and \"To Be True\" in particular are superb songs that simply didn't fit the flow of the album), as well as different versions of a few tracks that do (\"The Ties That Bind\" contains different lyrics, while \"Stolen Car\" and \"You Can Look [But You Better Not Touch]\" feature different arrangements). And the outtakes disc offers 22 variations on the album's themes that point to any number of directions the album could have gone, and if nothing else it says a great deal about Springsteen that he had enough good songs that numbers as strong as \"Party Lights,\" \"Roulette,\" \"Where the Bands Are,\" and \"Chain Lightning\" could end up on the shelf.</p><p>The Ties That Bind also includes a documentary (on DVD or Blu-ray) on the making of the album, as well as a full concert filmed in 1980 that finds Springsteen & the E Street Band in incendiary form. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection, like a high-profile DVD release of the 2000s, is more about the bonus features than the main feature, but the extras lend an invaluable perspective to one of the most important works in Springsteen's catalog, and this set makes it possible to imagine the many chapters that could have been added or removed from the album while still telling the same powerful story, as well as documenting the thought and effort Springsteen put into the process.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Amazon.com</strong></p><hr/><p>'The Ties That Bind: The River Collection' is a comprehensive look at Bruce Springsteen's 'The River' era, one of the most pivotal periods of time in his career. The set contains 52 tracks on 4 CDs with a wealth of unreleased material, and 4 hours of never-before-seen video on 3 DVDs. It is comprised of the original 'The River' double album as released in 1980; the first official release of 'The River: Single Album;' a CD of 1979/80 studio outtakes; a two-DVD film of never-released, newly edited multi-camera footage from Springsteen's famed 1980 show in Tempe, AZ, long rumored but never-before-seen; rare tour rehearsal footage; a brand new documentary \"The Ties That Bind\" about 'The River;' and a coffee table book of 200 rare or previously unseen photos and memorabilia with a new essay by Mikal Gilmore. </p><p>'The River,' was originally released on October 17, 1980 as a double album and reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. 'The River: Single Album' is the 10-track album that Springsteen recorded in 1979 as a follow up to 1978's 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' but never released. The fourth CD on the box set is 'The River: Outtakes,' which spans the entire 'The River' sessions in 1979 and 1980. Eleven songs are rarities that have never been released before, and for the most part are completely unheard and unknown even to fans, who have long considered Springsteen's outtakes to be treasured secrets. </p><p>\"The Ties That Bind,\" on one DVD, is a brand new 60-minute documentary that features an intimate interview with Springsteen as he reflects on the tumultuous, extended period writing and recording 'The River.' The film transitions between Springsteen telling the stories behind the music and illustrating them with solo acoustic guitar performances &mdash; interspersed with period concert footage and rare photos of Bruce and the band in and out of the studio. The final video component is \"Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: The River Tour, Tempe 1980,\" a new film produced from footage professionally filmed in 1980 using four cameras and recorded in multitrack audio. The film features 24 songs 2 hours, 40 minutes on 2 DVDs from Springsteen s November 5, 1980 concert at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ. Widely regarded as one of Springsteen s finest performances, this intense show features early live versions of over half of 'The River' songs. Also included is 20 minutes of footage from the late September, 1980 River Tour rehearsals held in Lititz, PA, showing Springsteen and The E Street Band working through live arrangements of what was then unreleased material from the upcoming album.</p><p>\"The Ties That Bind: The River Collection is packaged in a 10\" x 12\" box with a hardcover 148-page coffee table book containing 200 studio and live photographs most of which have never been seen before plus pages from Springsteen's notebooks, single covers, assets/images and outtakes from the original album package, and other memorabilia documenting the album. Liner notes include a new essay from journalist Mikal Gilmore, the original Rolling Stone album review from 1980, and Springsteen's updated comments about the album from the 1998 \"Songs\" book.</p><hr/><p>When Bruce Springsteen released The Promise back in 2010, it was a document of what could have been. Although most of the album's songs were recorded during the same sessions that birthed Darkness On the Edge of Town, they contrasted wildly in tone &mdash; where Darkness was steeped in working class angst, The Promise had a more romantic outlook. Its arrangements were lusher and its characters found easier escape from their blue-collar confinements, their gazes turned upward to the stars instead of towards the factories pumping out smog below. Even the handful of tunes that popped up on both records received dramatically different treatments. Most notably, The Promise‘s version of \"Racing In the Street\" touted a higher key and jaunty fiddle from David Lindley, both of which made it more uplifting than the more funereal original. Likewise, \"Factory\" was turned from a dour going-to-work song into a more hopeful getting-off-work song.When compiling the final product, Springsteen had a wealth of material to choose from, and for one reason or another — perhaps because he was getting older and had already pushed romanticism to its limit on Born To Run &mdash; he chose to explore the shadows. It's no mistake that the title of Darkness On the Edge of Town sounds so much more foreboding than The Promise. It's no mistake that its songs are, for the most part, heavier and more bitter.The Ties That Bind has a similar background. Well, almost. Originally submitted to Columbia Records as a single disc of 10 songs, it got expanded to a whopping 20 after The Boss decided he wanted the album to have more depth and variety. Thus, The River was born, a heartland rock buffet with everything from humorous bar jams (\"Cadillac Ranch\", \"I'm a Rocker\", \"Ramrod\") to soul-crushing folk ballads (\"Independence Day\", \"Drive All Night\", the title track) on the menu. What's more is that, even as an 83-minute double album, The River had more than twice as many songs that didn't make the cut.And that's where The Ties That Bind starts to differ from The Promise, despite them both being companion pieces to already existing albums. Since Springsteen and The E Street Band plowed through the former's sessions with a singular aesthetic in mind (American realism where the stakes range from trivial to life-threatening) as opposed to two different sides of the same coin, the collection doesn't feel like a bizarro version of The River as much as an extension of it. A title like …And Now, More of The River would have been just as appropriate.Fortunately, The River &mdash; and thus The Ties That Bind &mdash; happens to be a damn near perfect album. This was in Springsteen's heyday of sketching crucially unremarkable (i.e., realistic) characters to explore themes larger than themselves (and, for a time, himself), not the other way around. \"Stolen Car\" does indeed feature a car thief, but it's really about marital entropy. On The Ties That Bind, several of the River outtakes function as its sister songs, also doling out loss through low-level criminal activity: The most obvious is a more boardwalk-friendly \"Stolen Car\" (Danny Federici steps out front-and-center with his accordion) before both \"The Man Who Got Away\" and \"Roulette\" open on a turd on the run &mdash; one who's flying solo and another who's been forced to take his wife and kids with him. There are also everyday Joes and Janes who get caught up in crime even when they're not looking for it, such as the guy who sees his girlfriend gunned down by gang crossfire in \"Stray Bullet\". As over-the-top as that sounds, the band keeps pulp at bay with Steven Van Zandt‘s ripped-open background falsetto and a rare bit of soprano sax from Clarence Clemons.Of course, The River isn't solely about criminals and neither is its single-disc counterpart or its mammoth compilation of outtakes. And since all three of them are included here in order &mdash; The River on discs one and two, The Ties That Bind on disc three, then all of the outtakes (first the unreleased ones, then those already heard on 1998's Tracks box set and various singles) on disc four &mdash; you can continue playing the mirror game with all of the varying subject matter and musical formats. Weekend warriors get their due in \"Out In the Street\" (The River), \"Cindy\" (The Ties That Bind), and the fret-jumping lead single \"Meet Me In the City\" (the outtakes). Elsewhere, E Street flaunts its bar band cred in the dispensable but fun as hell \"Sherry Darling\" (The River), \"Chain Lightning\", and \"Paradise By the \"C\"\" (both on the outtakes), all of them shaken loose by group vocals, handclaps, and beer-soaked chatter. And since every last bit of music &mdash; serious and silly alike &mdash; places the same high currency on hooks and furious meat-and-potatoes rock, you could pick any 10 songs out of the box set's 52 and have one hell of an LP. Even Springsteen himself has confessed he's not sure why something as pummeling as \"Roulette\" was scrapped in favor of a throwaway track like \"Crush On You\". The River Collection isn't a glimpse of what could have been — it's raw proof that The River sessions produced too many good songs for one album (even a double album) to contain.</p> <p>&mdash; <strong>Dan Caffrey</strong></p><hr/><p>The River doesn't flow&mdash;it floods. Bruce Springsteen's fifth album gushes forth with the fury of a burst dam, delivering torrents of despair, inspiration, heartbreak, and joy. Coming after the deliberate twin masterpieces of Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town, records epic in scope but precise in execution, The River not only appears to be a mess but embodies the classic definition of a double album: it seems to be a clearinghouse for every song Bruce Springsteen had at the ready in 1980. The Ties That Bind: The River Collection shows just how wrong that assumption is. Expanding the original 20-song double album to a 4xCD set supplemented with video, it laughs at the notion that the original album was much too much by underscoring exactly how Springsteen intended the album to overwhelm.</p><p>Initially, Springsteen planned to follow 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town with an album called The Ties That Bind but he withdrew the record in the fall of 1979, believing that it wasn't \"big enough.\" This claim came from the stage during a 2009 performance of The River at Madison Square Garden, with Bruce going on to say, \"I wanted to capture the themes that I'd been writing about on Darkness. I wanted to keep those characters with me and at the same time added the music that made our live shows so much fun and enjoyable for our audience.\" On this box, the scrapped The Ties That Bind gets an official airing as the third disc on the set&mdash;here it's dubbed The River [Single Album]&mdash;and it does indeed play like a truncated, miniature version of The River, containing in its 10 tracks seven of the double-album's songs, along with two alternate versions of tunes that wound up on the released record. What's striking is what's absent: shorn of its party songs, the record feels gloomy and haunted&mdash;even \"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\" in a lonesome Sun rockabilly incarnation feels like a transmission from the lonely black of night. It reiterates many of the themes of Darkness, only without aggression, fury, or precision, the very things that give that record a lift that fights against its undercurrents of hopelessness.</p><p>Surely recognizing this deficit, Springsteen spent roughly another year in the studio, reviving old songs and writing new ones, arriving at full-blown, completed recordings of most of these tunes, then picking and choosing from his surplus to create the final album. The result was enough material for another double album, presented here as The Ties That Bind, a collection that runs two songs longer the 1980 double-LP but winds up six minutes shorter. This is an absurd amount of shelved material&mdash;and, even with this abundance, there are a handful of bootlegged cuts that didn't make the grade. There's a lot of unheard music here, even if some tracks are colored with new Bruce vocals, a slightly sour grace-note that is only notable upon close inspection.</p><p>Listening through the box, it's hard not to be struck by Springsteen's labor-intensive creative method. He knew the broad outline of what he wanted to achieve, so he kept tweaking his material in the studio, rearranging and recording until he found just the right emotion. If The Cutting Edge 1965–1966 proves how Bob Dylan sought to capture the lightning of a live performance, Springsteen always is seduced by the illusion of a record: sure, he's invigorated by live performance&mdash;and the Tempe concert included here is tremendous, the E-Street Band at the peak of their power&mdash;but he sculpts his albums out of tracks that are powerful as recordings, not simply songs.</p><p>This is especially true of The River, which Bruce loaded up with the purest, hardest, and happiest rock'n'roll the E-Street Band ever cut in the studio. \"She's the One\" pulsated to a beat borrowed from Bo Diddley and Darkness surged with desperate passion, but Bruce's first four records rarely touched on the ecstatic joy that can be had from just making noise. The River is full of these moments (\"Sherry Darling\", \"Crush on You\", \"I'm a Rocker\", \"Cadillac Ranch\"), and some of the weightier items trade in this same sense of exuberance&mdash;a sense of desperation cuts against the grain of the sunny hook on \"Hungry Heart\", and \"Two Hearts\" spins headfirst into unfettered romanticism. But this music is so simple, so visceral, that it's often been tagged as throwaway, the detritus surrounding the haunting \"The River\", \"The Price You Pay\", and \"Stolen Car\".</p><p>Thing is, these throwaways give The River its cinematic scope. Some of the newer additions were cut from a familiar forlorn cloth (\"Independence Day\", the closing pair of \"Drive All Night\" and \"Wreck on the Highway\") while \"Point Blank\" and \"Jackson Cage\" split the difference between the celebration and sorrow. But the biggest distinction between The River and the original Ties That Bind is this full-on bash, funny and furious and entirely sincere in its worship of the sounds rocking frat houses and AM radio in a '60s that didn't belong to the Beatles. It's the Springsteen album that can easily slip onto any show on Little Steven's Underground Garage, and this party winds up providing an ideal counterpoint to the sweeter, sadder moments on The River.</p><p>Take the second side, which opens with \"Hungry Heart\"&mdash;Bruce's first genuine hit single, reaching number five on a combination of its hook and Springsteen's general momentum&mdash;then dwells upon the cinematic escape \"Out in the Street\" and serves up two breakneck rockers before settling into the dreaminess of \"I Wanna Marry You\" and the stark \"The River\", the latter two hitting harder due to the companions. Each side is structured similarly, with the last song tipping slightly toward melancholy, the cumulative effect suggesting there's no separating pleasure from the pain. It all comes at once and, depending on mood, The River either seems like the happiest or saddest of Bruce's records: in its mess lies a mirror that reflects the listener's state of mind.</p><p>The Ties That Bind illustrates this sprawl was no accident. Within these 22 rejects&mdash;some of them sneaking out as B-sides or on previous reissues, including the 1998 box Tracks and the bonus disc on 2003's The Essential Bruce Springsteen&mdash;Springsteen explores the same terrain as he does on The River: urban romance, accidental violence, working-man's blues, and restless nights. Like its parent, The Ties That Bind achieves a delicate balance between adult despair and adolescent freedom: he may dwell upon \"Little White Lies\" and \"The Time That Never Was\", but he also borrows a song title from Claudine Clark (\"Party Lights\") and tips a hat to Connie Francis' beach classic Where the Boys Are (\"Where the Bands Are\"). Enough great songs didn't make a cut that it's possible to cobble together a killer single album from the outtakes&mdash;one that would open with the breathless \"Meet Me in the City\" and contain the cloistered paranoia of \"The Man Who Got Away\", the blank desperation of \"Roulette\", the open-hearted \"Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own\" and \"From Small (Big Things One Day Come)\", a heightened Chuck Berry story song Bruce turned over to Dave Edmunds. But like the completed album, what resonates is the magnitude of the sprawl itself.</p><p>As they spill out, the songs play off each other, accentuating the sorrow or celebration heard in their predecessors. Combing through these outtakes, it quickly becomes clear how Springsteen, Van Zandt, and Jon Landau constructed each track to deliver its own specific visceral thrill and then culled through their finished product to find the cuts that fit their intended design. Some of these rejects rely on that headstrong old time rock'n'roll&mdash;\"Living on the Edge of the World\" bops along to its syncopated swing, \"Paradise by the C\" is a roadhouse jam highlighting Clarence Clemons&mdash;but others play like ripostes to the E-Street Band's peers: the live \"Held Up Without a Gun\" (which would later morph into the finished \"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\") careens like Elvis Costello & the Attractions, the chiming guitars of \"Take 'Em As They Come\" seem like an answer to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, while \"I Wanna Be With You\" pulses to the Iron City rush of Joe Grushecky & the Houserockers.</p><p>Thirty-five years after the release of The River, it's easy to think of Bruce Springsteen as existing on a separate plane from such contemporary kindred spirits or perhaps as somebody who only belongs to part of a self-styled lineage that runs through Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. By adding The Times That Bind, both the scrapped '79 LP and this new double-disc collection of outtakes, to The River, this box highlights the plain, prosaic ways he belonged to his time. On these 52 songs, Springsteen sings about gas shortages, cold beer, unemployment agencies, busted dreams, and Burt Reynolds, fleeting images of a blue collar America that unknowingly was entering its decay but these words are married to the sound of a working band that knows it has to work, aware that it has to have songs to fuel those marathon three hour shows.</p><p>Springsteen never really let these straight-up rockers be part of his records again&mdash;maybe on Born in the U.S.A., but both \"Darlington County\" and \"Working on the Highway\" end in tears&mdash;but he also never quite worked the same way again, producing such a ridiculous surplus of finished material as he set out on his quest for bigger, greater things. The River brought Bruce to those heights, giving him his first number one album and Top 10 single, but it's hard not to think of it as not a beginning but an end, the last record where he and the E-Street Band were not the biggest band in the land but merely the best. In that light, piling on a ton of unreleased music, all in the same spirit and feel as the final album and nearly as good as what made the cut, feels like a gift. And for those who may think four CDs and three DVDs are too much, consider this: for an album that is all about contradictions, excess and mess, more of everything is most certainly a good thing.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Al Stewart had found his voice on <i>Past, Present & Future</i> and found his sound on <i>Modern Times</i>. He then perfected it all on 1976's <i>Year of the Cat</i>, arguably his masterpiece. There is no overarching theme here, as there was on its two immediate predecessors, but the impossible lushness of Alan Parsons' production and Stewart's evocative continental narratives give the record a welcome feeling of cohesion that keeps the record enchanting as it moves from \"Lord Grenville\" to \"Midas Shadow\" to \"Broadway Hotel,\" before it ends with the haunting title track. Along the way, Stewart doesn't dwell too deeply in any area, preferring to trace out mysteries with his evocative lyrical imagery and a spinning array of self-consciously sophisticated music, songs that evoke American and European folk and pop with a deliberate grace. This could be unbearably precious if it didn't work so well. Stewart is detached from his music, but only in the sense that he gives this album a stylish elegance, and Parsons is his perfect foil, giving the music a rich, panoramic sweep that mimics Stewart's globe-trotting songs. The result is a tremendous example of how good self-conscious progressive pop can be, given the right producer and songwriter -- and if you're a fan of either prog or pop and haven't given Al Stewart much thought, prepare to be enchanted.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Year of the Cat brought Al Stewart a genuine worldwide smash with its title track, and for its successor, he did make a few concessions. These, however, were slight -- just a slight increase of soft rock productions, an enhancement of the lushness that marked not only Year of the Cat but also Modern Times. These happened to be welcome adjustments to Stewart's sound, since they increased the dreamy continental elegance at the core of his work. And that's why Time Passages is the equal of Year of the Cat -- it may be more streamlined, but the adjustments to his sound and the concessions to the mainstream just increase the soft grace of his eloquent historical pop epics. It's possible to view this as too precious, because it is pitched at an audience who believes the common-day concerns of pop are piffle, but this is exceptionally well-crafted, from Stewart's songs, where even three-minute songs seem like epics, to Alan Parsons' cinematic arrangements and productions. This added concentration on the texture of the recording, ensuring that it was clean, spacious, and gentle, with a welcoming surface. Of course, this means that Time Passages can work very well as background music, but it also reveals much upon concentrated listening -- enough to make it stand proudly next to Modern Times and Year of the Cat as one of Al Stewart's very best albums.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The pun of the title of 24 Carrots -- the first overt signal of humor Al Stewart has displayed in years, possibly ever -- illustrates that a lot has changed since 1978's Time Passages. The loosening of his wit is perhaps the most evident, but the most significant is the departure of producer Alan Parsons, who collaborated with Stewart on his mid-'70s triptych of masterpieces. In truth, 24 Carrots isn't far removed from those high points, because he is indeed still writing at a remarkably consistent pace. No, this record isn't quite at the high standard of the previous three albums, but it does have a number of brilliant moments, from the opening \"Running Man\" through the silly but effective \"Mondo Sinistro\" and the gorgeous \"Midnight Rocks.\" Though there are some songs that don't quite click (something that did not happen on the aforementioned trio), overall the record coheres nicely, thanks not just to the uniform classiness of Stewart's songs, but to his production with Chris Desmond. Although the production does hint at the antiseptic cleanliness that sank many of his latter-day recordings, here, it is just a perfect balance of audio precision and elegant studiocraft. Despite its occasional missteps, it still is a fine record, a fitting, wistful coda to Stewart's classic period.

The superb \"Marianne\" and \"Change Partners\" more than satisfy the listener, while the dark and brooding \"Know You Got to Run\" and the prophetic \"Fishes and Scorpions\" are prime examples of his power as a singer and a songwriter. But when he misses the mark, as on \"Ecology Song,\" he misses it by a mile and then some. Besides that cut, \"Bluebird Revisited\" is pure self-indulgence that someone of his craft and technique should have known better than to include here -- or anywhere. But with CD players, one can omit anything offending and concentrate on what's good about Stephen Stills 2. Cut the disc in half, and you have a very enjoyable listening experience.

		"review": "<p>Talk about understatement -- there's Stephen Stills on the cover, acoustic guitar in hand, promising a personal singer/songwriter-type statement. And there is some of that -- even a lot of that personal music-making -- on Stephen Stills, but it's all couched in astonishingly bold musical terms. Stephen Stills is top-heavy with 1970 sensibilities, to be sure, from the dedication to the memory of Jimi Hendrix to the now piggish-seeming message of \"Love the One You're With.\" Yet, listening to this album three decades on, it's still a jaw-dropping experience, the musical equal to Crosby, Stills & Nash or Déjà Vu, and only a shade less important than either of them. The mix of folk, blues (acoustic and electric), hard rock, and gospel is seamless, and the musicianship and the singing are all so there, in your face, that it just burns your brain (in the nicest, most benevolent possible way) even decades later. Recorded amid the breakup of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Stills' first solo album was his effort to put together his own sound and, not surprisingly, it's similar to a lot of stuff on the group's two albums. But it's also infinitely more personal, as well as harder and bluesier in many key spots; yet, it's every bit as soft and as lyrical as the group in other spots, and all laced with a degree of yearning and urgency that far outstrips virtually anything he did with the group. \"Love the One You're With,\" which started life as a phrase that Stills borrowed from Billy Preston at a party, is the song from this album that everybody knows, but it's actually one of the lesser cuts here -- not much more than a riff and an upbeat lyric and mood, albeit all of it infectious. \"Do for the Others,\" by contrast, is one of the prettiest and most moving pieces of music that Stills has ever been associated with, and \"Church (Part of Someone)\" showed him moving toward gospel and R&B (and good at it, too); and then there's \"Old Times Good Times,\" musically as good a rock song as Stills has ever recorded (even if it borrows a bit from \"Pre-Road Downs\"), and featuring Jimi Hendrix on lead guitar. \"Go Back Home\" (which has Eric Clapton on guitar) is fine a piece of bluesy hard rock, while \"Sit Yourself Down\" features superb singing by Stills and a six-person backing chorus (that includes Cass Elliot, Graham Nash, and David Crosby) around a great tune. \"To a Flame\" is downright ethereal, while the live \"Black Queen\" is a superb piece of acoustic blues. All of this is presented by Stills in the best singing voice of his career up to that point, bolder, more outgoing, and more powerful (a result of his contact with Doris Troy) than anything in his previous output. He also plays lots of instruments (à la Crosby, Stills & Nash, which is another reason it sounds so similar to the group in certain ways), though a bit more organ than guitar, thanks to the presence of Hendrix and Clapton on two cuts. If the album has a flaw, it's the finale, \"We Are Not Helpless,\" which slightly overstays its welcome. But hey, this was still the late '60s, and excess was the rule, not the exception, and it's such modest excess.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

It is credited to \"The Stills-Young Band,\" which is to say, Stephen Stills and his band with Young added, and the two divide up the songwriting and lead vocals, five for Young, four for Stills. The pairing, though it proved short-lived and had, in fact, ended before this album was released, must have seemed commercially logical. Like Young, Stills had seen his record sales decline after a successful period following the 1970 breakup of CSNY. So had erstwhile partners David Crosby and Graham Nash, but they had returned to Top Ten, gold-selling status in the fall of 1975 with their Wind on the Water duo album. Why couldn't Stills and Young do the same thing? Maybe they could have (and, actually, this was the first gold album for either in two years) if they had made a better record together. Young's songs were pleasant newly written throwaways with the exception of the title track, a trunk song he had written as a tribute to an old car. Stills' compositions seemed more seriously intended, but still were not substantial. The playing, largely handled by the professional sessionman types in Stills' band, was far smoother than what one was accustomed to in a Young album. The result was a listenable record, but not a compelling one, and thus well below Young's usual standard and Stills' best.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

He did pluck them straight out of Wynton Marsalis' backing band (thereby angering Wynton and emboldening his anti-rock stance, while flaring up a sibling rivalry between the trumpeter and his saxophonist brother Branford -- a veritable hat trick, that), and since he was initially a jazz bassist, it seemed like a good fit. At the very least, it seemed like a monumental occasion because he documented the entire development of the band and the making of Dream with a documentary called Bring on the Night, releasing a double-live album as its soundtrack just a year after the debut hit the stores. This could be called hubris (and so it appears to be), especially because the appearance of the live album feels like a way of showcasing Sting's jazz band and jazz chops. Most of the songs run around five minutes and there are no less than three melodies, two of which marry an old Police number with a tune from Dream. Arriving as a second solo album, it can't help but feel a little unnecessary, even if the loose, rather infectious performances show what Sting was trying to achieve with his debut. Even so, this is a record for the cult, and while it will satisfy them, to others it will seem like, well, hubris.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

Using the same basic band as Nothing Like the Sun, the album has the same supple, luxurious tone, stretching out leisurely over nine tracks, almost all of them layered mid-tempo tunes (the exception being grinding guitars of the title track). Within this setting, Sting hits a few remarkable peaks, such as the elegant waltz \"Mad About You\" and \"All This Time,\" a deceptively skipping pop tune that hides a moving tribute to his father. If the entirety of The Soul Cages was as nimbly melodic and urgently emotional as these two cuts, it would have been a quiet masterpiece. Instead, it turns inward -- not just lyrically, but musically -- and plays as a diary entry, perhaps interesting to those willing to spend hours immersing themselves within Sting's loss, finding parallels within their own life. This may be too much effort for anyone outside of the devoted, since apart from those two singles (and perhaps \"Why Should I Cry for You\"), there are few entry points into The Soul Cages -- and, once you get in there, it only rewards if your emotional state mirrors Sting's.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Reason number 872 why I hate REM: their arrogance. Back in 1995 as the band geared up for their \"Monster\" tour, bassist Mike Mills spoke to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine about the upcoming trek, the band's first in five years. He commented upon how important it is for bands to play live. To paraphrase, he related how the Police were a tight little post-punk act in their early days, but once they became an \"art project\" and stopped touring, they became useless and irrelevant.<p><p>Even after five years, I still find Mills' hypocrisy to be stunning. First of all, though \"Monster\" marked a return to harder-edged guitar rock, over the couple of albums prior to that release, REM had largely indulged in the kind of \"artsy\" experimentation for which he condemned the Police. During that period, REM did not tour; before 1994's \"Monster\", their last outing occurred in support of 1988's \"Green\", though that trek didn't happen until 1990.<p><p>Not only was Mills a hypocrite, but he was wrong. Despite his allegations to the contrary, the Police never became a \"studio-only\" outfit. Yes, their albums became more and more complex, but they still supported each one with extensive tours, through and including their hugely-successful swansong, 1983's \"Synchronicity\".<p><p>Even after the band split and Sting went off on his own, the consistent touring continued. As a matter of fact, Sting has played in support of each of his six solo albums, beginning with 1985's \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" up through 1999's \"Brand New Day\". REM can't even tour behind two albums in a row, much less the eleven straight backed by Sting (with and without the Police)!<p><p>Unfortunately, not all is positive in relation to Sting's live performances. I've seen him on each tour since the 1981/1982 outing behind \"Ghost in the Machine\" and I'm afraid his live shows have definitely declined over the years. I can't offer many comments about the January 1982 Police gig I saw because I was too inexperienced; it was only the third show I'd ever seen. I had a few more under my belt by the August 1983 concert, which I found to be pretty solid, and was much more experienced by the occasion of the August 1985 solo performance I witnessed.<p><p>In my opinion, Sting's first solo tour remains the pinnacle for his career on his own. It all seemed fresh and exciting, and he was backed with a tremendously solid band. Branford Marsalis provided a fine onstage foil for the boss, and entire ensemble created an energy that made the shows sizzle.<p><p>For the most part, a similar power inhabited Sting's 1988 shows in support of 1987's \".Nothing Like the Sun\", though they weren't quite as strong as the 1985 gigs. Marsalis and some other musicians carried over from the earlier band, but a fair number of changes occurred. Nonetheless, the energy level remained high and the concerts were quite solid.<p><p>Unfortunately, Sting's shows in the Nineties weren't as entertaining. His 1991 tour found him with a completely-revamped band and a much more bland presentation. Instead of Marsalis, Sting's main partner on stage now became guitarist Dominic Miller. (Sting played guitar on his two prior solo tours and returned to the bass on this outing.) Miller's technically proficient and an able musician, but he has absolutely no personality whatsoever, and none of the other band members did anything to spark the proceedings either.<p><p>As such, the 1991 shows were musically-competent but generally somewhat lifeless affairs, and the three tours Sting has mounted since - 1993/94, 1996, and 1999/2000 - have all been virtual clones of that presentation. Miller continues as his guitarist - he's the only carryover from the 1991 band - and the shows remain listenable but fairly dull.<p><p>In a way, Sting's albums have followed the same pattern. While with the Police, each of their five albums seemed different; their sound slowly evolved from record to record, and though they all feel like the work of the same band, there are few songs that could easily be transplanted from one album to another. That trend continued during his first two solo records, though the differences seemed more subtle.<p><p>And then - bam! Sting hit a wall. If you examine his four albums from the Nineties, they're virtually interchangeable. He latched onto a fairly gentle VH1-ready sound he liked and has done little to deviate from that tone since then. Yes, he presents a fair number of stylistic changes within each work, from pop to country to jazz, but the results all still seem fairly even, and one could easily take pretty much any song off of, say, \"Brand New Day\" and drop it on one of the others and no one would notice the difference.<p><p>Don't get me wrong - I still enjoy Sting's work. However, I fail to generate much enthusiasm for it. His music has become too generic for my liking, and it lacks many distinctive qualities. The workmanship seems solid but the inspiration fails to appear.<p><p>On the DVD of Sting: The Brand New Day Tour Live at the Universal Ampitheatre, we find an October 1999 representation of his current act. I saw him live in June 2000, and I thought the DVD portrayed what I witnessed fairly effectively, though Sting seemed more lively during the Universal show. No, he doesn't do a whole lot, but he showed a little spark and energy that he lacked when I saw him locally.<p><p>This still doesn't make the concert rival the shows he put on in the Eighties, and I doubt he'll ever go anywhere with drowsy Miller in his band. To be fair, there's not a lot of energy coming from any part of Sting's group; they all seem like competent but disinterested participants. Actually, I can't recall the last time I saw a group of musicians who appeared so completely uninvolved with each other. Usually different folks interact, but that rarely occurs here; it's as though each of them resided in their own little sound booth and they can't have any active dealings with the others.<p><p>Actually, this tendency makes the show more entertaining as home video viewing than as a live performance. Frankly, I found much of the concert to be boring when I took it in live last summer. Granted, it didn't help that I'd just seen three Springsteen shows and two Bowie performances the week prior to Sting's concert; since Bowie and Bruce are easily the two best live performers I've even seen, it was hard for me to adjust to anyone less talented.<p><p>Even without that factor, however, I still wouldn't have thought much of Sting's show just because I like to have some sort of visual stimulation when I watch a concert. The stage is a very simply affair, and the lighting tends toward light reds, blues and yellows. The biggest flash we see happens during \"Desert Rose\"; some fake fire effects that use paper and wind appear. It's a very conservative stage.<p><p>No, I don't require dancers, lasers and explosions; neither Bruce nor Bowie indulge in such antics and their shows are as good as it gets. I just want something interesting to watch; otherwise I might as well stay home and listen to the CD.<p><p>Or watch the DVD, as in this case. Actually, this program perfectly complements Sting's live show: it's a well-executed but bland presentation. The concert was filmed and edited in a most conservative manner, with no flashy camera moves or any kind of quick cuts. It's a fairly unexciting way to show the concert, but it works pretty well, especially since more daring techniques would have seemed so inappropriate here. I've seen concert videos that try to use effects and editing to \"spice up\" a performance; McCartney's Paul Is Live becomes almost unwatchable due to such antics.<p><p>As such, Sting Live is a moderately entertaining but fairly unexceptional concert video. It represents the show itself pretty well, which isn't a terrific compliment. I like Sting, and I'll continue to see him live, but I do so with somewhat low expectations. When you witness a Sting concert, you'll get a musically competent but drab performance that will likely leave your memory as soon as he departs the stage.<p><p>Note that although the DVD presents 18 songs, which is a fairly substantial roster, it doesn't include the entire setlist. The following tunes were performed at the October 29, 1999 concert but can't be found on this DVD: \"Roxanne\", \"Mad About You\", \"Fields of Gold\", \"Bring On the Night/When the World Is Falling Down You Make the Best of What's Still Around\", and \"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\". Why'd they cut these songs? I have no clue. Since the DVD only runs about 88 minutes, I can see no reason to omit so many songs, especially since all of them are popular numbers; their absence would only hurt sales.<p><p>Also, although some publicity materials for the DVD claim that it contains all of the songs from \"Brand New Day\", this isn't true. The concert omits \"Big Lie Small World\", so only eight of that album's nine songs appear. Actually, the set features a pretty solid mix of elements from Sting's career, though the Police side seems underrepresented; only three of those tunes - \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\", \"Every Breath You Take\" and \"Message In a Bottle\" - make the cut.<p><p>\"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\", Sting's first solo album, is represented by \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\" and \"Moon Over Bourbon Street\", while follow-up \".Nothing Like the Sun\" shows up via \"We'll Be Together\", \"Englishman In New York\" and \"Fragile\". \"Seven Days\" comes from \"Ten Summoner's Tales\", while \"Lithium Sunset\" represents \"Mercury Falling\". Albums completely neglected? Police titles \"Outlandos D'Amour\" and \"Zenyatta Mondatta\" plus Sting's \"The Soul Cages\". Note that if the six deleted tunes appeared on this DVD, those three absent albums would then be represented; \"Outlandos D'Amour\" featured \"Roxanne\", \"When the World.\" came from \"Zenyatta Mondatta\", and \"Mad About You\" was on \"The Soul Cages\". Too bad the omission keep this DVD from offering a better career overview.<p><p>The DVD:<p><p>Sting: The Brand New Day Tour Live From the Universal Ampitheatre appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 1.33:1 on this single-sided, single-layered DVD; due to those dimensions, the image has not been enhanced for 16X9 televisions. Overall, this show looked pretty solid, though the original videotaped material betrayed a few limitations that kept it from becoming great.<p><p>Sharpness appeared largely crisp and accurate throughout the concert. At times, many wider shots looked a bit soft and fuzzy, though this tendency seemed minor and wasn't a huge concern. Moiré effects were absent, but jagged edges cropped up with regularity; guitar strings and curves of instruments often cause such problems, and Sting was no exception. In regard to the source material, almost no flaws were discerned. I saw a blip or two, but no more significant problems, though the general blandness that comes from videotaped programs meant that the show lacked sparkle.<p><p>Almost all of the colors seen during the concert came from the lights; Sting and the band wear black or other dark tones. The lighting tended to feature warm, pastel hues, and violets, oranges, light reds, and blues dominated the proceedings. The videotapes nature of the program occasionally made the colors seem a little heavy, but for the most part they looked accurate and clear. Black levels appeared slightly pale at times, but they usually seemed deep and rich, and for low-light shots from the stage, shadow detail was appropriately dark but not excessively thick. Crowd views generally seemed much harder to discern, but I don't fault the production for that, since no lighting would be offered for those bits. All in all, the concert looked quite clean and watchable.<p><p>Also fine but unexceptional was the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack of the concert. Actually, Sting is perhaps the biggest star who supports 5.1 recordings; in addition to this DVD, you can buy DTS CDs of the Police's \"Greatest Hits\" plus Sting's \".Nothing Like the Sun\", \"Ten Summoner's Tales\" , and \"Brand New Day\".<p><p>The soundfield heard on the DVD seemed pretty conservative. From the forward channels I detected decent stereo separation for the music but the mix didn't appear especially broad or well-defined. The instruments were placed in distinct locations to a degree, but they seemed to blend together in too mushy a manner; rarely did particular elements stand out very clearly. The surrounds were used simply to provide light reinforcement of the music and also to transmit occasional crowd noise. For all intents and purposes, this is a stereo soundtrack with a mild surround presence.<p><p>Audio quality seemed fairly strong. Sting's voice occasionally appeared too bright within the mix, and his vocals sometimes came across as slightly rough, but for the most part, his singing sounded clear and natural. The rest of the music seemed clean and relatively crisp throughout the proceedings. Dynamic range was good, though I thought the mix could have used strong low end. One oddity: at the start of \"Desert Rose\", the volume level escalates noticeably but returns to normal at the end of the song. Why does this happen? I have no idea, but keep the remote to your receiver handy; you'll likely want to knock down the volume a notch or two before the tune starts.<p><p>One thing I definitely liked about the soundtrack is that it seemed clear that no overdubs were performed to fix mistakes. The music sounded natural and real, and appears to come completely from an actual performance. These tendencies are best noted through some of Sting's vocals; you can easily hear him strain at times, and I'm pretty sure he messes up the first line to \"Every Breath You Take\": maybe I'm wrong, but I think he warbles, \"Every breath you make\". Hey, it may not sound like much, but a lot of performers would have fixed this error, and I appreciate the appropriate rawness that comes across through the audio.<p><p>Most music DVDs include literally no extras, so it's a pleasant surprise to find a minor addition to this disc. We get 15 minutes and 15 seconds of \"backstage footage\". This consists of a variety of semi-candid shots of Sting and others involved in the concert as they wait for the show to begin. It also includes a mix of interview snippets, most of which feature Sting's reflections on performing live and touring, but we hear a few lines from other band members and various production personnel as well. It's not exactly revelatory material, but it's a moderately interesting glimpse behind the scenes and it merits a look.<p><p>Ultimately, I recommend Sting: The Brand New Day Tour Live at the Universal Ampitheater just because I remain fond of his work and no other DVD representations of his music appear, but it's not a great program. The concert itself balanced different sides of his career fairly well, but the performance seemed somewhat drab and lifeless. The DVD offers solid though unexceptional picture and sound plus a nice extra. Sting fans will want to own this, but others may be less interested; I don't think it's the kind of video that will make any new devotees to his music.<p>&mdash; <b>Colin Jacobson</b>"

One might also find these recordings spanning 1968 through 1970 full of charm and honesty. Four city kids are unsatisfied with the pop vocal groups and become enamored with the folk revival of the time. This is their worthy attempt to add to that honored body of work. Several bluegrass vocal favorites are treated here. Among them are \"Sunny Side of Life\" and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" While the Strange Creek Singers sometimes outdo themselves technically, their passion and love for their craft makes this album a classic.</p>"

		"review": "<p>Okay, can someone please remind me why The Strokes were such a polarizing force about two years ago?     Listening to Is This It last week had me scratching my head over how it managed to become the     Roe vs. Wade of the rock crit world in 2001, with everyone forced to choose sides: \"saviors of rock!\"     or \"everything that's wrong with music today!\"  At the time, I found myself in the latter category,     ironically earning myself a spot on this very staff with a lengthy diatribe against the band's hype     machine, socioeconomic background, and rampant influence-pilfering.  You know, basically everything     but the music.          I feel pretty silly about such grandstanding nowadays, having finally listened to, and embraced, at least     the show-stopping middle third of The Strokes' debut.  But with the release of Room on Fire, both     sides of The Great Strokes Debate look a little foolish; NYC's finest have all but given birth to an     identical twin.  In the interim, a perplexing flirtation with Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich (\"you know,     'Last Nite' was just a few lasers away from being perfect!\") was scrapped, and the band's relentless     touring failed to lead them down the cockier, arena-rock path some suspected they'd travel.  Instead,     Room on Fire is eleven songs sharing DNA with its predecessor, a follow-up of more sleepy,     contagious mono-pop that doesn't sound diligently recorded so much as yawned out.          This is far from a bad thing, largely because The Strokes seem almost pathologically unable to write a     song that isn't immediately catchy.  Tracks like \"Reptilia\", \"Meet Me in the Bathroom\", and \"Under Control\"     take their place alongside the highlights of the band's debut, all hitting that perfect contrast of woozy     nonchalance and taut guitar work that appears to be the alpha and omega of their stylistic inventory.     That there's nothing new or innovative to be found here is sure to be a common complaint, though only     those who prize evolution over knowing one's strengths will cry fraud.          Speaking of the originality quotient-- and not to add more historical tinder to the fire of what bands The     Strokes supposedly owe a debt to, but-- lead guitarist Nick Valensi is sweating The Pixies' Joey Santiago     something fierce here.  His development is the only newish detail I can detect on Room on Fire, and     it's an inspiration that lends improvement; Santiago's beautifully simple lead lines were The Pixies'     secret weapon, and Valensi employs a similar humble style to lend a melodic counterpoint to the proceedings.     Whether showing up at the Halloween party as The Cars' keyboard on \"12:51\" or contributing slow-hand solos     to \"What Ever Happened?\" and \"You Talk Way Too Much\", it's an extra spritz of tuneship that only assists     The Strokes' infectious ways.          Of course, Julian Casablancas is a far cry from Frank Black as vocalists go, but it can at least be said     that he knows his place through Room on Fire.  Wisely avoiding the unbecoming screaminess of subpar     Is This It tracks like \"Take It or Leave It\" and \"New York City Cops\", he instead applies a cough     syrupy croon to \"Under Control\" and \"The End Is No End\", its bum notes smoothed out by his payphone vocal     effect addiction.  Casablancas also appears to have moved beyond the smirking misogyny of his early lyrics,     just as the cover art is sagely chosen to continue the abstract graphic theme of the Stateside edition of     Is This It rather than the Smell the Glove-style UK version.          Meanwhile, the rhythm section, the band's Achilles' heel, continues to miraculously scrape by, lending     these tracks a vaguely new wave air despite slack-limp playing (hey guys, trade Godrich's number for the     DFA's and you might be onto something).  Drummer Fabrizio Moretti has always tended to sound a bit like     a drum machine, and here his best work happens when he shares the drummer's stool with a sampler--     \"The Way It Is\" and \"Meet Me in the Bathroom\" shuffle with the best technology 1983 had to offer.  Bassman     Nikolai Fraiture, mostly relegated to backbone status on this outing, carries less of the band's melodic     weight than he did on Is This It but gets a front-of-stage moment on the perfectly choreographed     breakdown of \"Reptilia\".          It remains to be seen whether old white men will continue to trumpet The Strokes as leading the cause of     hiphopicide, and if young white idealists will stand firm on the opposite side, regarding the band as the     Nike of indie rock (and no doubt fixating their conspiracy theories on Casablancas' sarcastic aside     \"keepin' down the underground, oh no!\"); what's clear is that The Fab(rizio) Five neither deserve, nor     desire, either status-- their goals are about as unpretentious and uncomplicated as possible.  They may     not be able to get away with milking this formula for many more albums, but for now, Room on Fire's     eleven songs find them drowsily getting away with what they do best.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Up until 2004, Stop Making Sense was the only easily available live Talking Heads album on compact disc, but it caught the band in the second phase of its career, presenting a polished stage show after having arrived squarely in the mainstream with the success of Speaking in Tongues (their fifth album) and \"Burning Down the House\" in particular. It was a distinct change. Speaking in Tongues was their first new music in three years and was noticeably upbeat and danceable compared to the dark paranoia of Remain in Light and Fear of Music and the undistilled art-school geekiness of their first two albums. Stop Making Sense captured Talking Heads at the height of their popularity, but not at the height of their power. After all, it was those first four albums that established the band among critics and a fervent semiunderground following. And that's where The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads comes in. It was the perfect summary to the first phase of their career, presenting an LP of material performed by the original quartet (1977-1979) and an LP of material from the Remain in Light tours of 1980 and 1981 (featuring a greatly expanded band lineup). But alas, it languished in the strictly analog domain for more than two decades. In 2004, finally, The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads was made available on compact disc, and it may well have been worth the wait. Each version of the band is still given a disc of its own, but the longer running time of compact discs versus LPs means you're treated to almost double the original number of tracks.</p><p>The first disc, which features the original quartet, is brilliantly expanded with the original LP sequencing completely intact and all the bonus tracks coming between the LP sides (except for \"Heaven,\" the perfect album closer). The sound is crisp and clear, with tight drumming, a great punchy bass sound, and clearly separated guitars that allow you to really hear what complementary (and fine) players David Byrne and Jerry Harrison were. Byrne is the über-geek with a totally unique delivery (especially on tracks like \"Who Is It?,\" \"Artists Only,\" and \"Stay Hungry,\" not to mention his nervous stage announcements), but they all play with the raw energy of a young band on the way up. The bonus tracks are all excellent. There is no sense whatsoever that they were simply padding things for a longer running time, and it's just great hearing live versions of songs like \"Mind\" (with extended guitar solo), \"The Big Country,\" and \"The Book I Read\" that have never been readily available in live form. As fantastic as the first disc is, the second one is perhaps even more exciting. The expanded band (ten musicians and two backup singers) is amazing, not only adding power and punch to the Remain in Light material, but in most cases surpassing the studio versions (no mean feat). These live versions of \"The Great Curve,\" \"Houses in Motion,\" and \"Crosseyed and Painless (all prominently featuring Adrian Belew) are nearly worth the price of admission alone, but the bonus tracks here are just as exciting. The original release had no overlapping songs on the two LPs, with the large version of the band sticking solely to tunes from Remain in Light and Fear of Music. Now you're treated to arrangements of \"Psycho Killer,\" \"Stay Hungry,\" and \"Warning Sign\" as performed by the expanded lineup, not to mention live versions of \"Animals,\" \"Cities,\" and \"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On).\"</p><p>The band is on fire throughout the performances, and fans of Belew's guitar playing will practically be giddy with ecstasy. These are some of his finest performances strictly as a guitarist, and although Remain in Light was the only studio album he played on, he beautifully adds his own touches to \"Stay Hungry\" and especially \"Psycho Killer.\" Byrne also contributes some cool guitar, sometimes using a great delay sound, and again, the clear separation of instruments lets you really hear the details. The producers chose to depart from the album sequencing on this disc, opting to reproduce the entire set list in order instead. It works up until the end, where they move \"The Great Curve\" from its position at the beginning of side four and make it the album closer. It might be a more exciting song to finish the set, but folks who already know this album expect \"Take Me to the River\" to be the end, and it's a bit jarring to have the music continue after that (understanding this, the liner notes actually explain how to program the original album sequencing). However, that's a very minor quibble about a re-release that actually manages to vastly improve on an already excellent album. The liner notes also include a number of reviews of T-Heads live shows, and they wisely chose to reproduce all the band photos that originally decorated the inner sleeves as well.The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads is not only a vital document of an important, groundbreaking band on its way up, it's one of Talking Heads' best albums, easily surpassing Stop Making Sense. They were a young and hungry band making a name for themselves, pushing the boundaries of pop music and performing with palpable energy. Highly recommended.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p><hr/><p>The liner notes to the long-awaited CD debut of Talking Heads' 1982 live release, The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, recommends other albums by the New York four-piece. The list includes each of the band's studio albums, plus Rhino's four-disc box set Once in a Lifetime; perhaps conspicuous in its absence is that other live Talking Heads album, the far more popular and legendary Stop Making Sense.</p><p>It may not have been a confrontational omission, but the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme's Talking Heads concert film has long overshadowed The Name of This Band&mdash;so much so that fans have long doubted that this earlier (and superior) live album would ever make it to compact disc. Thankfully, however, Rhino has now not only reissued The Name of This Band, but has also taken a cue from the recent \"Special Edition\" of Stop Making Sense by adding 13 tracks which weren't on the original version.</p><p>Part of the charm and power of Stop Making Sense the film is that it almost purely translates the live experience of a rock show audience rather than the experience of a touring band. There is no backstage fly-on-the-wall stuff, no dressing room preparations, on-the-bus interviews, caterers, hotel clerks or road managers. Rather, it's the snapshot of one live document with the camera playing the role of a punter, trained completely on the band in an attempt to recreate the experience of attending the show. It works so well that it's almost jarring when the camera finally closes in on audience members dancing in the aisles during the show's finale.</p><p>Musically, this approach is a bit limiting. As powerful as Talking Heads were at the time, Stop Making Sense still functions as a live document of one band at one moment in time (well, not technically&mdash;the film was actually recorded over three nights). For a group such as this, who paid attention to the musical world around them, deftly and quickly folding outside influences as seemingly disparate as disco, afrobeat, funk and new wave into their already unique sound, The Name of This Band's approach&mdash;collecting various live performances over a four-year period&mdash;is more revelatory and rewarding. It functions as both a timeline in which a listener can trace the band's development and definitive proof that some of their supposed great departures&mdash;particularly an accomplished and complex rhythm section&mdash;were there from the onset.</p><p>The result is both the best career-spanning snapshot of and single-purchase introduction to Talking Heads&mdash;odd accolades for a live record&mdash;and a treat for longtime fans. The record's title refers to band leader David Byrne's dry, cheeky, no-nonsense stage patter in the band's early days, the years documented on the set's first disc. \"This song is called 'New Feeling' and that's what it's about,\" Byrne begins, leading the four-piece group with both his animated, acrobatic vocal tics and affectations and the band's nervous, twitchy music.</p><p>All bugged eyes and neurosis, Byrne spits and churns his way through the best tracks from the band's first three albums. His oft-criticized, stream-of-consciousness language (best illustrated by the \"Busy Doin' Nothin'\"-like driving directions and matter-of-fact descriptions of the benefits of his apartment building and favorite federal laws in \"Don't Worry About the Government\") ground the band's more aggressive, robust playing music. At times, Byrne gets a little punchy as well, injecting anger and bemusement into \"I'm Not in Love\" and adding a bitter tone to \"The Big Country\", transforming it from the hazy thoughts of an airplane traveler to a more combative rumination on the urban/rural divide. It would be a candidate for the official anthem of the mythical Blue States if the so-called culture wars and other right-wing chicanery continue to drive their regrettable wedge into the country.</p><p>When required, however, Byrne can craft an expressive lyrics, as indicated by the literate detail of tracks such as \"Psycho Killer\", \"Life During Wartime\" and \"Found a Job\". And on an early version of \"Electricity (Drugs)\"&mdash;one of three tracks first released on a rare Warner promo release&mdash;the band is sleepy and drony, countering the lyrical claims that \"I'm charged up.\" That track is also one of only three that is repeated on both discs, although on Disc 2, it's in as the more familiar \"Drugs (Electricity)\".</p><p>The second disc borrows a page from Stop Making Sense's playbook and recreates the entire set from stops along the band's Remain in Light tour, including a handful of tracks from the much-bootlegged February 1981 performance at Tokyo's Nakano Sun Palace. Expanded to a 10-piece band that included Adrian Belew on guitar and Bernie Worrell on keyboards, the bulk of Disc 2's material gives its studio versions a run for the money. Belew's nuanced guitar work, more confident contributions from the core members, and the added rhythmic dimension and heft are frequently jawdropping, but the loose beats and a playful Byrne keep claims of muso nonsense at arm's length.</p><p>The set itself is ordered nearly chronologically, which neatly and accidentally conforms to the logic of the album's running order. Within the set, the band builds the rhythmic density of their tracks, kicking off with a quartet of songs from their first two albums (including second appearances by \"Psycho Killer\" and \"Stay Hungry\"), before the funk-influenced \"Cities\" and African rhythms of \"I Zimbra\". Those two fractured, beat-heavy and offbeat tracks guide the audience into the final two-thirds of the set, which is mostly built from the polyrhythmic Remain in Light. Along the way, a melodic \"Animals\"&mdash;perhaps the set's weakest track in its studio version&mdash;easily surpasses the original, led by a gorgeous harmonic middle section.</p><p>Last week, Rhino also released an 18-track Best of Talking Heads set. Spanning the band's entire 11-year career, it's well-selected considering its considerable limitations and is arguably more inclusive than The Name of This Band, but it is also unnecessary as anything other than a grab bag of familiar radio hits. This live album, on the other hand, is not simply a fans-only document or a curio or a means of padding the discography or exploiting fans. In many ways, it's the best one-stop document of what made Talking Heads one of the post-punk era's most dynamic and urgent bands, and a succinct argument for the merits of synthesizing rock with emerging, potentially oppositional sounds. The latter is a lesson that will hopefully be learned by today's rock artists.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Scott Plagenhoef, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Phaedra is one of the most important, artistic, and exciting works in the history of electronic music, a brilliant and compelling summation of Tangerine Dream's early avant-space direction balanced with the synthesizer/sequencer technology just beginning to gain a foothold in nonacademic circles. The result is best heard on the 15-minute title track, unparalleled before or since for its depth of sound and vision. Given focus by the arpeggiated trance that drifts in and out of the mix, the track progresses through several passages including a few surprisingly melodic keyboard lines and an assortment of eerie Moog and Mellotron effects, gaseous explosions, and windy sirens. Despite the impending chaos, the track sounds more like a carefully composed classical work than an unrestrained piece of noise. While the title track takes the cake, there are three other excellent tracks on Phaedra. \"Mysterious Semblance at the Strand of Nightmares\" is a solo Edgar Froese song that uses some surprisingly emotive and affecting synthesizer washes, and \"Movements of a Visionary\" is a more experimental piece, using treated voices and whispers to drive its hypnotic arpeggios. Perhaps even more powerful as a musical landmark now than when it was first recorded, Phaedra has proven the test of time.</p><p>&mdash;John Bush</p>"

As a result, it was their first hit album in the U.S., peaking at number 20 in September of that year. This recording is a primer of British blues-rock of the era, showcasing Alvin Lee's guitar pyrotechnics and the band's propulsive rhythm section. As with most of TYA's work, the lyrics were throwaways, but the music was hot. Featured is a lengthy cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,\" with reworked lyrics leaving little doubt what the singer had in mind for the title character. Also included was a twelve-bar blues song with the ultimate generic blues title, \"I Woke Up This Morning.\" Ssssh marked the beginning of the band's two-year run of popularity on the U.S. album charts and in the \"underground\" FM-radio scene.</p>&mdash; <b>Jim Newsom</b>"

		"review": "<p>Since Matchbox Twenty is a faceless group, recognizable for its hits rather than its image, it's easy to assume that the band is nothing more than a solo project in disguise for its frontman, lead singer and chief songwriter Rob Thomas (who should not be confused with Rob Thomas, the creator of UPN's 2005 cult TV series Veronica Mars). Not only is he prominent in the band's videos and press, but he scored the biggest hit of his career with \"Smooth,\" a song he penned and sung for Santana's 1999 comeback, Supernatural. Even though Matchbox Twenty's 1996 debut, Yourself or Someone Like You, was a big hit and spawned four radio hits, \"Smooth\" was bigger than any of them, making Thomas famous, if not exactly a star. Instead of striking out for a solo career in 2000, he returned to his band, releasing Mad Season that year and More Than You Think You Are two years later. While both records had different moods -- the former was polished and radio-ready, the latter hit a little harder -- both found Thomas working as part of a unit, not as a flashy frontman. This may have illustrated how Matchbox Twenty worked as a band; in particular, More Than You Think You Are sounded like the work of a driven, cohesive unit, even the songs weren't quite up to snuff -- but they also had to sound a little workmanlike, and certainly not the product of the savvy cross-cultural crossover creator of \"Smooth.\" Given the relatively lackluster reception of More Than You Think You Are, the timing was right for Thomas to launch his official solo career in the spring of 2005. It was time to give his music a new coat of paint, similar to how \"Smooth\" spun his career in a different direction, and that's exactly what his solo debut, Something to Be, is: a slick new variation on Thomas' signature sound.</p><p>With its anthemic choruses and achingly sincere sentiments, Something to Be is clearly the work of the lead singer/songwriter of Matchbox Twenty, yet it lacks the lean rock-oriented sound of the group's albums, even if it is helmed by Matt Serletic, who has produced all three of the band's records. Serletic and Thomas have made a conscious attempt to have this solo album feel lighter, brighter, and a little hipper than Matchbox Twenty's music, adding slight drum loops and electronic elements to the rhythms while taking Thomas away from strictly guitar-based arrangements. Heavy on keyboards, elastic guitars, horns, insistent rhythms, and even the occasional gospel-inspired backing chorus or worldbeat inflection, this is a far splashier affair than the average Matchbox Twenty album, and that alone would make Something to Be a noteworthy solo record, since it is indeed a different beast than Thomas' regular gig, but the fresher sound is married to a strong set of songs that play to his strengths as a craftsman of big, anthemic post-alternative mainstream rock. This isn't edgy work by any means -- and for as hooky and chorus-driven as it is, it's music that becomes memorable through repeated plays, never quite catching hold upon the first listen -- but it's more colorful and well-constructed than a lot of contemporary mainstream rock in the mid-2000s, and it's arguably more appealing than Matchbox Twenty's earnest guitar rock, which can occasionally seem rather drab. With Something to Be, Thomas delivers an album that is at once familiar and fresh. It may not be something to win over the doubters, but it's enough to give him a promising new beginning to the second decade of his recording career, not unlike how \"Smooth\" helped propel him through the post-grunge fallout of the new millennium. [Something to Be is one of the first albums to be released solely as a DualDisc -- a disc that contains a CD of the album on one side and a DVD of the album with extras on the second side. The DVD contains a 5.1 mix of the album, lyrics for the 12 songs (these lyrics are also printed in the album's booklet), a link to Thomas' website, a plug for his charity Sidewalk Angels Foundation, a photo gallery containing nine photos, and a 20-minute making-of-the-album documentary that contains footage of Thomas writing, Thomas singing a lead vocal, John Mayer recording his cameo, and, finally, a photo shoot with Thomas.]</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

		"review": "<p>Small Town Romance was compiled from three warts-and-all live recordings (originally produced for radio broadcast) of Richard Thompson performing solo acoustic in New York City in 1982. The above-mentioned warts (a cough here and there, a very occasional flubbed note) are tiny and difficult to spot, but Thompson was quite aware of them -- enough so that he persuaded Hannibal Records to delete the album from their catalog, though when the out-of-print album began fetching ridiculously high prices on the collectors market, he consented to a reissue in 1997. While the album is a hardly flawless recreation of the live Richard Thompson experience (and Thompson's solo acoustic shows would be noticeably stronger a few years down the line), it does capture Thompson's estimable charm as a stage performer with commendable accuracy, and the program is superb, featuring several Fairport Convention classics, a number of outstanding numbers from the Richard & Linda Thompson catalog, and a few otherwise unrecorded songs, most notably the devastating title track, which still stands as one of Richard's finest meditations on his favorite theme, love gone wrong. Small Town Romance may not be perfect, but it preserves a handful of passionate and impressive performances from one of the most gifted guitarists and songwriters around -- which puts it far ahead of the vast majority of live albums that will cross your path. Hopefully, though, one of Richard Thompson's even more dazzling solo shows from the 1990s will find it's way onto a widely available, non-bootleg CD some time in the future.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Mark Deming</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Richard Thompson is the sort of artist destined to be a cherished cult item rather than a bona fide star, which at the dawn of the 21th century puts him in an uncomfortable place in the music industry -- being able to reliably sell 100,000 copies of an album makes you too small for a major label, no matter how long they've kept you on the roster. In 2000, after a dozen years with Capitol Records, Thompson's contract was not renewed, and 2003's The Old Kit Bag found him recording for an independent for the first time since 1985. Creatively, this actually turns out to be a good thing; after the periodically excessive and self-conscious production Mitchell Froom imposed on nearly all of Thompson's releases for Capitol, 1999's Mock Tudor (produced by Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf) found Thompson going for a more lean and live sound, and with John Chelew at the controls, Thompson follows suit on The Old Kit Bag. Cut in a straightforward and stripped-down manner, with just bassist Danny Thompson, drummer Michael Jerome, and harmony vocalist Judith Owen along for company, The Old Kit Bag captures Thompson in spare but sympathetic circumstances; the performances are strong and confident, without a note or gesture wasted, and Thompson's interplay with his rhythm section is nothing short of superb. While Thompson eases back on the \"wow, listen to that!\" solos on The Old Kit Bag, his playing is fluid and superbly tasteful throughout, and his subtle overdubs show he's as good an accompanist as a bandleader. And Thompson's songwriting chops are still in superb shape; \"A Love You Can't Survive\" and \"I'll Tag Along\" are further meditations on Thompson's favorite theme, love and life gone wrong, and \"Outside of the Inside\" (which Thompson introduced on tour as \"a song about how the Taliban see the West\") is a chilling look inside a man blinded by his culture and his faith (and a bit of a surprise coming from a devout Muslim). The Old Kit Bag is Richard Thompson's simplest and most unadorned album since Shoot Out the Lights, and while it isn't an immediate masterpiece like that album, it confirms that this man's work is best presented at its simplest, and the result is a modest triumph.</p><p><strong>&mdash;Mark Deming</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The change of direction on Lontano, the third release by Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko and his three young collaborators — Marcin Wasilewski (piano), Slawomir Kurkiewicz (bass), and Michal Miskiewicz (drums) — is startling. Whereas Soul of Things (2002) and Suspended Night (2004) focused on Stanko's increasing sense of balladry and structurally harmonic, assonant atmospheres, Lontano showcases a band confident enough after playing for five years to find real space for free improvisation. Recorded in the south of France instead of Oslo, producer Manfred Eicher works his name magic and allows stillness and silence to play as much a role as the performers engaging one another musically. The opening title track is the first of three such excursions with the title \"Lontano.\" Here, Wasilewski's piano opens the door and allows for the band to haltingly and carefully enter the tune, contributing economically until a groove eventually develops out of one of Stanko's balladic ideas. Ever so slowly the beat becomes circular and focused, the band vamps on it, gradually gaining in intensity until it threatens to fall apart. But it never does. Instead the band winds it way back down into silence. \"Cyrhia\" begins as a thoughtful, hesitant ballad, but once more finds its way out into the world, entering it as a near-modal blues. \"Kattorna\" was originally performed by the Krzysztof Komeda group on its influential — and groundbreaking — album Astigmatic in 1965. Its angularity has been rounded off, but its sense of adventure is retained and Stanko's own economical style on playing, and then playing around its lyric line, is impressive, as is Kurkiewicz's empathic bassline. The other two \"Lontano\" pieces, at the middle and near the end of the disc, represent a kind of improvisation that actually sings. The interplay between the trio members and Stanko is instinctive. It's not nearly so hesitant and ranges farther than on \"Lontano I.\" Lyricism and melodic ideas are never sacrificed in this kind of improvisation, but the playing is so free it nearly leaves the realm of jazz altogether. This is outside playing with heart, tenderness, and quiet beauty in its marrow. The silences on \"Lontano III,\" are so vast, it's as if the listener can enter and remain inside any one of them. Indeed, this is music as poetry itself, a pure language at once crystalline and dreamy. The set closes with \"Tale,\" a piece Stanko recorded on his ECM debut in 1975. This version reflects restraint in its more euphoric spaces. The idea of story comes from the slowly unfolding piano chords of Wasilewski, who urges the trumpeter on to solo until the end, not so much of the piece, but until the story is complete. Lontano is at once the distillation of 40 years of European vanguard jazz history, and at once the key in the door of the lock where it enters the world not as a music categorized by its instrumentation or personnel, but as music itself; where harmonics, space, and the improvisational language expressed in it transcends genre and classification. This band is simply astonishing, and Lontano is their most adventurous and cohesive recording yet.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Since relocating to America from his native Europe, Polish trumpeter Tomasz Stanko has assembled a crack band to articulate his ever fluctuating, often experimental musical ideas. His New York Quartet, consisting of pianist David Virelles, bassist Thomas Morgan, and drummer Gerald Cleaver is a study in contrasts. The septuagenarian trumpeter proves as wily as ever on Wislawa, a double-disc titled for the late poet and Nobel Laureate Wislawa Szymborska, who passed away in 2012, and whose work and persona proved influential in composing the material for this set. Several of these pieces bear the titles of her poems. Stanko's signature brooding, cranky, tone-altering phrasing and disconsolate spirit of tenderness are apparent throughout, but they don't necessarily dictate the album's flow. Two versions of the title track bookend the album and showcase those qualities in balladic form, as do others such as \"April Song\"; there is also plenty of fire here, evidenced by the aggressive interplay of the rhythm section on tracks such as \"Assassins\" and \"Metafizyka.\" \"Mikrokosmos\" is a Stanko showcase, offering at its opening all manner of squeals, skronks, sputters, and sharply angled tones before Virelles adds a Latin touch and the quartet settles into a groove. Likewise in the \"Dernier \"Cri,\" where the spirit of Miles Davis' second quintet is evoked. The second disc opens with \"Oni,\" led by Morgan's bass walk. It commences impressionistically, yet develops into an easy grooving post-bop thanks to the bassist and Cleaver's shimmering cymbal work. \"Tutaj - Here\" offers scintillating -- though often subtle -- interplay between Virelles and the trumpeter, while \"Faces\" presents the pianist's forceful, canny, harmonic assertions that the rhythm section responds to with near glee. Stanko is at his most fiery in this driven post-bop number that also recalls the Davis quintet's fearless sense of exploration. Throughout this set, Stanko leads this band as he has many others: by example. His democratic sensibilities allow his players to be fully themselves through his compositions, in turn adding depth and heft to them. Wislawa deftly celebrates in a deliberate way, not only the memory of an honored person in Stanko's life, but also the profound inspiration of her life's work upon his own.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

It's a solo performance with a twist: Towner plays not only 12-string and classical guitars, but also very competent piano. Only \"Entry in a Diary\" and \"Mon Enfant\" are unaccompanied guitar solos; the latter, a traditional melody, is also the sole non-original. On four of the remaining six tracks, Towner accompanies himself via overdubs, playing both guitar and piano for an effect vaguely reminiscent of Bill Evans' Conversations With Myself. The best of these is \"Icarus,\" one of Towner's best-known compositions, which also appeared on Matchbook, his 1976 duo album with Gary Burton. The guitarist's most unusual moves include playing a set of gongs behind his sparse 12-string work on \"Images Unseen,\" and using his guitar entirely as a percussion instrument to create a propulsive rhythm track for \"Erg.\" He closes with a tuneful solo piano piece titled \"The Silence of a Candle.\" The reissue of Diary was timed to coincide with Towner's 2001 solo outing, Anthem.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>David R.

		"review": "<p>On this solo recording, Ralph Towner returns to the elementary sounds of his classical and 12-string guitars for inspiration. Though an accomplished pianist, French horn, and trumpet player, Towner has left all of them out of Anthem's stark mix. And it's a good thing too. There was a time when his love of the Prophet V synthesizer and his piano improvisations covered over the gracefulness of his trademark signature on the guitar. Anthem begins with \"Solitary Woman,\" for 12-string. It's based on modal intervals and harmonics. His sense of drama in the piece is remarkable; coming from a melodic framework and building an architecture of trills and single-string runs, he then evolves the piece into a chordal spiral, where semitones fall off in rows until only the melody remains -- skeletal, icy, crystalline. On the title track, he uses the classical guitar to create a riff-based structure, adding one element and then another, quoting from \"Greensleeves\" in one section until he has harmonically changed the entire structure of the tune's body, creating an almost Renaissance melody from its framework.</p><p><i>Anthem</i> reveals Towner in the role of being a composer for the guitar rather than of music. For example, City of Eyes, which was for an ensemble, relied both on composition and improvisation to offer a view of the album as something resembling a film score. Anthem has no such aspirations, but it's a far loftier album. These precise, moving, and technically virtuostic compositions have flair and depth to them; they accentuate the voices of these two guitars as solo instruments capable of carrying the most complex musical issues to the fore and resolving them. But above all, as the compositions \"The Lutemaker,\" \"Very Late,\" \"The Prowler,\" \"Gloria's Step,\" and \"Three Comments\" make plainly clear, Towner writes with great aesthetic beauty and settles for nothing less as a player. If there was ever any doubt of the latter being true, one need only hear the album's closing track, Charles Mingus' \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.\" Towner proves a consummate jazzman; his sensitivity to a complex melodic and harmonic work is instinctual. In fact, his reading of this tune is the most significant version heard on the instrument thus far -- and there have been many. Indeed, <i>Anthem</i> is Towner's finest album in a decade and one of the finest in his distinguished career.</p> &mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

Anthem was issued in 2000. Time Line is a return to the stark, spacious and lyrical explorations of that set. That's not to say this is any kind of direct replica. Towner's a restless artist, he pushes his boundaries on the classical and 12-string guitars. The set contains 14 new compositions and two fine covers that provide the real reason for Towner's not-so-secret inspiration here: George Gershwin's \"My Man's Gone Now,\" and Harold Arlen's \"Come Rain or Come Shine.\" The muse, of course, is Bill Evans. Evans has been forever associated with the former tune since his 1961 trio performance of it at the Village Vanguard; the latter is a tune he played live fairly often in the '60s and even the '70s. Time Line is full of lively, even, bright textures and moods. Check out the languid beauty of \"Turning of the Leaves\" or the nearly singing \"Always by Your Side,\" or the nearly Celtic folk aspects of \"Anniversary Song,\" where he plays airs and rounds. The moodier and more melancholy side of his playing can be heard in the brief \"Oleander Etude,\" or the tender, near flamenco single string playing in the 50-second section of \"Five Glimpses/3.\" \"Freeze Frame,\" the gorgeous 12-string exercise here, uses the instrument's droning quality to establish a harmonic resonance in spite of the legato playing he does on the higher strings. The set closes with the Gershwin tune, also played on the 12-string. His chromatic elegance and grace underscore the tune's nuances and subtleties even as he brings the lyric to the fore with extended chord voicings and embellishing the sonorities that echo the piano's more controlled tensions. In sum, this is a brief but utterly captivating issue from one of the music's great composers and theorists that should not be missed by anyone interested in Towner, of course, but also in melodic improvisation and composition.</P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B>"

Undoubtedly the most rewarding failure in rock history, the Who's <i>Lifehouse</i> was kick-started and then abandoned in 1971 as a post-<i>Tommy</i> stage experiment. Composer Townshend's unwieldy dream of bringing together new music and controlled theatrical space with audience interaction sadly burst, but it also scattered song gems through various albums: <i>Who's Next</i>, Townshend's 1972 <i>Who Came First</i>, and <i>Lifehouse Elements</i> (2000).</p> <p>With passing years, Townshend has sought to unify and celebrate the music of his unrealized project, and this DVD, simultaneously contemplative and hard-charging, refines familiar warhorses (\"Bargain,\" \"Pure and Easy,\" \"Baba O'Riley\") into works of refreshed beauty and gives Townshend a chance to shine on such lesser-known titles as \"Greyhound Girl.\" Often magical and surprisingly fun, this is a keeper for Townshend fanatics.</p>&mdash; <b>Tom Keogh</b> <p><b>Description</b><br>Thirty years have passed since Pete Townshend began work on \"<i>Lifehouse</i>,\" but it's only now that the technology exists to make the experimental nature of the piece a reality. This recording of the concerts held at Sadler's Wells in London on February 25 and 26, 2000, is a celebration of the music of \"<i>Lifehouse</i>\" rather than the culmination of the project. To this day, Pete Townshend is continuing the exciting musical experiments he first pioneered in a small South London theatre back in 1971.

Meanwhile, former band member Steve Winwood formed Blind Faith, which produced a debut album that topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. No wonder Island and UA determined that the fall of 1969 was a good time for a Traffic compilation. The release was especially needed in Britain, where the singles sides \"Paper Sun,\" \"Hole in My Shoe,\" and \"Smiling Phases\" had not yet appeared on an LP. Since Traffic had moved away from being a singles band after its first year, the album was not dubbed a hits collection, though all its tracks had been released on one side or the other of a single on one side or the other of the Atlantic. As a selection of the best and most popular material from the group's first three albums, the result is hard to fault, though it's worth noting that the missing \"Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush,\" the theme song from the 1967 movie of the same name, was a Top Ten hit in England. Also missing, on the British version of the LP, anyway, was \"You Can All Join In,\" a song that had enjoyed popularity in continental Europe. (The American version did include \"You Can All Join In,\" which replaced \"Smiling Phases.\") The group's U.K. hit singles, \"Paper Sun\" and \"Hole in My Shoe,\" were already beginning to sound like quaint bits of psychedelia by 1969, but the entire second side of the LP, comprising \"Medicated Goo,\" \"Forty Thousand Headmen,\" \"Feelin' Alright,\" \"Shanghai Noodle Factory,\" and \"Dear Mr. Fantasy,\" was the kind of progressive rock that would define Traffic and give it its place in the rock pantheon.

		"review": "<p>At only 22 years old, Steve Winwood sat down in early 1970 to fulfill a contractual commitment by making his first solo album, on which he intended to play all the instruments himself. The record got as far as one backing track produced by Guy Stevens, \"Stranger to Himself,\" before Winwood called his erstwhile partner from Traffic, Jim Capaldi, in to help out. The two completed a second track, \"Every Mother's Son,\" then, with Winwood and Island Records chief Chris Blackwell moving to the production chores, brought in a third Traffic member, Chris Wood, to work on the sessions. Thus, Traffic, dead and buried for more than a year, was reborn. The band's new approach was closer to what it perhaps should have been back in 1967, basically a showcase for Winwood's voice and instrumental work, with Wood adding reed parts and Capaldi drumming and occasionally singing harmony vocals. If the original Traffic bowed to the perceived commercial necessity of crafting hit singles, the new Traffic was more interested in stretching out. Heretofore, no studio recording had run longer than the five-and-a-half minutes of \"Dear Mr. Fantasy,\" but four of the six selections on John Barleycorn Must Die exceeded six minutes. Winwood and company used the time to play extended instrumental variations on compelling folk- and jazz-derived riffs. Five of the six songs had lyrics, and their tone of disaffection was typical of earlier Capaldi sentiments. But the vocal sections of the songs merely served as excuses for Winwood to exercise his expressive voice as punctuation to the extended instrumental sections. As such, John Barleycorn Must Die moved beyond the jamming that had characterized some of Traffic's 1968 work to approach the emerging field of jazz-rock. And that helped the band to achieve its commercial potential; this became Traffic's first gold album.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The album chronicled a late edition of the band in which original members Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, and Chris Wood were augmented not only by percussionist Reebop Kwaku Baah, but also by a trio of session musicians from the famed Muscle Shoals studio, Roger Hawkins, David Hood, and Barry Beckett. The studio pros lent a tightness and proficiency to their characteristic free-form jams, and though they sometimes sounded like they couldn't wait to get the songs over with, the tunes went on and on, four clocking in at over ten minutes. That might have been okay if the choice of material had been more balanced across the band's career, but 1971's Welcome To the Canteen had treated earlier efforts, and the 1973 tour was promoting Shoot Out At the Fantasy Factory, from which three of the six selections were drawn. Unfortunately, that album was not one of Traffic's best, and the live versions of its songs were no more impressive than the studio ones had been. Traffic: On the Road featured plenty of room for soloing by some good musicians, but it was the logical extreme of the band's forays into extended performance, with single tunes taking up entire sides on the original LPs. It's not surprising that, after this, Traffic shrunk in size and returned to shorter songs. [Though best known in its two-LP version, Traffic: On the Road was initially released in the U.S. as a single LP containing only four tracks.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

But the question of whether Winwood and Capaldi could validly constitute Traffic by themselves was not addressed until 1994, 20 years after the group disbanded, when the two surprisingly announced they would be recording and touring under their old band name. The album they made together sounded for the most part like a Winwood solo album. He played most of the instruments and sang (Capaldi drummed and sang occasional backup vocals), and he didn't show much interest in the lengthy instrumental passages that characterized Traffic in its heyday. Winwood, the composer, had simply moved on from that old style, and since the new Traffic wasn't a band in any real sense, its sound reflected his contemporary concerns. But if you listened to the lyrics, written by Capaldi, you did hear traces of the old Traffic. Granted, lyrics were not among Traffic's strong suits, but Capaldi, in his sometimes roundabout way, did have certain continuing concerns -- a generalized sense of spirituality, a tendency to give advice, and a rejection of the negative aspects of modern society. Winwood may have wished to return to music of greater substance, and if so, he got what he wanted; Far from Home certainly explored weightier topics than a Steve Winwood album. But Capaldi hadn't really improved as a writer over the years, and the final product still worked better musically than lyrically, and, to most ears, didn't really sound like a Traffic album. The resulting confusion kept the album from having much commercial impact.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

When Impulse started out in 1960, John Coltrane and Tyner were the first artists to be signed, and when Impulse was briefly brought back by MCA in the 1980s, two of its most important albums were recordings by Brecker. There are not a lot of surprises on this quartet matchup (with bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron Scott) except perhaps for how well Tyner and Brecker mesh together. The music is somewhat similar to a set by the pianist's regular trio with a solo piece (\"Blues Stride\"), a generous amount of Tyner originals and colorful versions of Thelonious Monk's \"I Mean You\" and \"Good Morning Heartache,\" but Brecker's presence and consistently powerful playing does inspire Tyner and his sidemen. For a strong example as to why today's saxophonists have such a high opinion of Michael Brecker, his roaring statement on the extended \"Impressions\" will suffice.

		"review": "<p>War turned U2 into arena rock stars, and the EP Under a Blood Red Sky captures the band on its supporting tour as the band members adjusted to their larger audiences. Unsurprisingly for a band that always favored the grand statement, the group flourished in such a setting, as this mini-EP attests. Comprised of material recorded in America and Germany, Under a Blood Red Sky draws equally from the band's first three albums, and these live versions, while less textured, are considerably tougher than their studio counterparts and illustrate quite effectively why U2 were considered one of the best, most exhilarating live bands of the '80's.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>In the early 1980's, U2 had earned critical respect and a swelling fanbase but, despite a UK #1 album, were far from superstardom. After debuting with Boy (1980), an album of strident post-punk, then following with a brief yet still promising hiccup (1981's October), in 1983 they released the more direct and overtly political War. Now tackling big themes and universal concerns with dramatic gestures and chest-beating choruses, U2 weren't yet an arena band but they carried themselves like one. What's more, they actually sounded better the bigger and brasher and bolder their music got. It's no surprise then that, in the U.S., this would-be Important Rock Group's profile and reputation became, like many other important rock groups, amplified via live performances-- the group's eye-opening 1985 Live Aid set, and the earlier mini concert album, Under a Blood Red Sky.</p><p>One of the younger bands on Live Aid's Boomer-heavy bill, U2 spent more than half of their alloted time performing \"Bad\", the standout track from their then-recent The Unforgettable Fire. While most of the bands onstage in London and Philly that weekend remained aloof and distant from the enormous crowds, Bono waded into the photo pit to embrace and slow dance with a member of the audience-- a rare moment of real human connection at what was meant to be a showcase of global unity. Only Queen and their monumental performance of \"We Are the Champions\" came off better that weekend.Under a Blood Red Sky, released at the tail end of 1983, was a little less spontaneous and truthful. With its striking, scarlet-drenched cover, a shoutout to Colorado's Red Rocks on opener \"Gloria\", and the concurrent VHS release Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky (now bundled nicely as a DVD with some versions of this release), the LP was packaged to emphasize the natural beauty of the amphitheater's mountain setting.</p><p>In truth, however, only two songs from Under were recorded at Red Rocks (\"Gloria\" and \"Party Girl\")-- most were taken from a show in Germany, while one performance was recorded in Boston.Yet when the group performed at Red Rocks on a rainy June night, with lit torches above a panoramic skyline, the venue provided an ideal backdrop for U2's literally flag-waving music, with everything-- earth, wind, fire-- in place to maximize and heighten the drama of the moment and the songs. Red Rocks, too, began a love affair with America that carried through the rest of the decade, as the group's music began to match the spacious, seemingly limitless scope of the American countryside and they effectively explored American myths and touchstones on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree before carrying the approach a step too far on the bloated, pastiche-y Rattle and Hum.And, hell, it worked.</p><p>MTV played the hell out of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and other videos from the performance, and the audio and video documents cemented U2's reputation as a commanding live band. Rather than release a full concert-- which could have resulted in a cumbersome and unnecessary record, particularly for a group with only three albums to date-- U2 wisely cherrypicked their best songs, created an out-of-order tracklisting built to maximize the LP's impact rather than accurately present a their live experience, added a solid B-side (\"Party Girl\") to enhance the worth of the release to longtime fans, and let the package take on its own myth.The record itself opens with crowd noise, highlighting the bond between U2 and their fans and emphasizing the role of the audience in the group's ascendency. They were a true populist band, unafraid to make strong, direct connections with listeners at a time when many of their post-punk peers shied from such gestures.</p><p>The band's strident performances here are all interspersed with recognition of the crowd, the act of performance, and the value of entertainment, and most-- from \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and its \"this is not a rebel song\" intro to \"I Will Follow\" to rugged, lesser-known tracks \"Gloria\" and \"The Electric Co.\"-- became arguably the definitive reads of these songs. (This reissue, like the original U.S. release of the LP, features the truncated version of \"The Electric Co.\", without the snippet of \"Send in the Clowns\" that appeared on some international editions.) The closing sing-along of War's \"40\" ends the record where it begins-- in the voices and cheers of the audience, a converted mass that, over the rest of the decade, carried the sound of the group back to their homes, places of work, schools.Eventually, the drive and work to be the biggest band in the world became a seriously uncool pursuit in many circles-- one could argue Nirvana punctured this sort of excess and spotlight-craving as surely as they did hair metal or indie dance. </p><p>These days, many distrust guitar bands who don't reflect their own personal values, who they don't believe merely walk, talk, think, and act like them. Somehow, a group is more genuine if they're more, well, regular, or plain, even less accomplished or incurious about a wider world-- groups are often unwilling to show flashes of ability, or they'd rather preach to a choir than attempt to unify the masses, or they're happy being a big fish in a small pond. It's a weird attitude. (Good thing Americans don't ask for the same from their national politicians-- oh, wait...) But anyone interested in retracing U2's meteoric rise-- in relocating what made them an 80's touchstone at a time when their flirtations with earnestness came across more as combativeness rather than self-righteousness-- would do well to start here.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Scott Plagenhoef, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Using the textured sonics of <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> as a basis, U2 expanded those innovations by scaling back the songs to a personal setting and adding a grittier attack for its follow-up, <i>The Joshua Tree</i>. It's a move that returns them to the sweeping, anthemic rock of <i>War</i>, but if War was an exploding political bomb, The <i>Joshua Tree</i> is a journey through its aftermath, trying to find sense and hope in the desperation. That means that even the anthems — the epic opener \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" the yearning \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" — have seeds of doubt within their soaring choruses, and those fears take root throughout the album, whether it's in the mournful sliding acoustic guitars of \"Running to Stand Still,\" the surging \"One Tree Hill\" or the hypnotic elegy \"Mothers of the Disappeared.\"</p><p>So it might seem a little ironic that U2 became superstars on the back of such a dark record, but their focus has never been clearer, nor has their music been catchier, than on The <i>Joshua Tree</i>. Unexpectedly, U2 have also tempered their textural post-punk with American influences. Not only are Bono's lyrics obsessed with America, but country and blues influences are heard throughout the record, and instead of using these as roots, they're used as ways to add texture to the music. With the uniformly excellent songs — only the clumsy, heavy rock and portentous lyrics of \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" fall flat — the result is a powerful, uncompromising record that became a hit due to its vision and its melody. Never before have their big messages sounded so direct and personal.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>U2 started out as a scrappy band riding the punk wave out of Ireland, but from the beginning they clearly had their sights on America. And indeed, the States ate up U2's bombast, landing both War (1983) and The Unforgettable Fire (1984) in the U.S. top 20. The group fed off that enthusiasm, criss-crossing the country as much as its schedule allowed. The more the band's fan base grew, the harder U2 worked to get even bigger, and in 1987 they enjoyed their breakthrough into superstadom thanks to The Joshua Tree, which went on to sell 10 million copies in the U.S. alone.</p><p>Funnily enough, while The Joshua Tree once and for all catapulted U2 to permanent superstardom, the album marks something of a conscious refinement of the group's sound. The album was nowhere near as strident as War or as radically overwrought as The Unforgettable Fire (which was, lest one forget, recorded in a frickin' castle). Reunited with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, it's as if the band finally took a moment to ponder the wide-open American spaces it had been traveling through for years and applied those musical and cultural observations to its songs. It's an album made for dusty, empty flyover country.</p><p>U2 have always flirted with charismatic Christianity, and the Joshua Tree songwriting process finds the band in a particularly reflective mood; \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" and\" \"With or Without You\" are steeped in religious imagery, but even their constant radio rotation hasn't robbed these introspective songs of their potency or effectiveness. Smartly, U2 balanced those personal songs with more universal tracks, often with an emphasis on forgotten people and forgotten places around the globe: \"Red Hill Mining Town\" (about the mid-80s UK miners strike), \"Exit\" (inspired by Norman Mailer's Gary Gilmore tome The Executioner's Song), \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" (about Argentina's murdered political dissidents), and \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" (about U.S. meddling in Central America).</p><p>\"Bullet\" is one of the few Joshua Tree non-singles to remain a live U2 staple&mdash;its bluster hints at the band's current broad aesthetic&mdash;but it's slightly out of place among a record mostly characterized by its grace, subtlety, introspection, and beauty. That holds especially true for its more mysterious (or at least less overplayed) second half, which roughly begins and ends perfectly with the ballad \"Running to Stand Still\" (about heroin addiction) and gentle outro \"Mothers of the Disappeared\". In between, \"Trip Through Your Wires\" is the rare blues track to prominently feature co-producer Eno's favored novelty, the Omnichord, while \"One Tree Hill\" and the apocalyptic \"Exit\" showcase wickedly screwed up and uncharacteristic guitar solos from the Edge.</p><p>No question, the disc deserves this anniversary treatment, but other U2 albums need the remastering more. As for the 14-tracks disc of B-sides and extras, it's best to keep expectations firmly in check. U2 aren't known for hiding away gems, or for that matter, sharing their studio experiments&mdash;not even the reggae-tinged version of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" shows up here. What we get instead is mostly the usual array of previously released tracks and familiar rarities&mdash;best among them are \"Spanish Eyes\", \"Silver and Gold\", the original version of \"The Sweetest Thing\", and \"Deep in the Heart\"&mdash;plus a handful of tracks new even to hardcore fans. Of those, \"Beautiful Ghost/Introduction to Songs of Experience\" and \"Drunk Chicken/America\" are moody spoken word pieces. The Patti Smith-styled \"Wave of Sorrow (Birdland)\" is similarly a bit out of character for the band, which explains what it's doing here.</p><p>While the haters were already on board, it was with its next album, Rattle and Hum, that the group's egos finally overtook their ambitions, and it took a near fatal break and the resounding triumph Achtung Baby to set the band back on track. But to this day U2 's Joshua Tree breakthrough&mdash;and, in particular, Bono's insistence on living up to the messianic role his fans and admires foisted upon him&mdash;still resonates as a lingering source of scorn, suspiciousness, and ridicule. If you don't doubt that, then try to sit through the (videotaped, not filmed) July 4, 1987 concert at an outdoor venue in Paris, the 40-minute Outside It's America documentary, and the music videos stuffed onto the set's DVD.</p><p>About the only remarkable thing about the concert is that it starts with \"I Will Follow\" rather than \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". As for the doc, it plays like a Rattle and Hum test run that will leave you throwing things at your screen as the band goes shopping, signs autographs, and poses for photos. There is, however, a rare glimpse of U2's sense of humor that teases their future neo-ironic rebirth hidden on the DVD: footage of the fames Dalton Brothers, the band's country alter-egos, who opened a few dates on the Joshua Tree tour (replete with Adam Clayton in drag). But after a couple of minutes of their shtick, you'll want to throw stuff at them, too.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Joshua Klein, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Reinventions rarely come as thorough and effective as Achtung Baby, an album that completely changed U2's sound and style. The crashing, unrecognizable distorted guitars that open \"Zoo Station\" are a clear signal that U2 have traded their Americana pretensions for postmodern, contemporary European music. Drawing equally from Bowie's electronic, avant-garde explorations of the late '70s and the neo-psychedelic sounds of the thriving rave and Madchester club scenes of early-'90s England, Achtung Baby sounds vibrant and endlessly inventive. Unlike their inspirations, U2 rarely experiment with song structures over the course of the album. Instead, they use the thick dance beats, swirling guitars, layers of effects, and found sounds to break traditional songs out of their constraints, revealing the tortured emotional core of their songs with the hyper-loaded arrangements. In such a dense musical setting, it isn't surprising that U2 have abandoned the political for the personal on Achtung Baby, since the music, even with its inviting rhythms, is more introspective than anthemic. Bono has never been as emotionally naked as he is on Achtung Baby, creating a feverish nightmare of broken hearts and desperate loneliness; unlike other U2 albums, it's filled with sexual imagery, much of it quite disturbing, and it ends on a disquieting note. Few bands as far into their career as U2 have recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as they do on Achtung Baby, and the result is arguably their best album.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>\"If you give a pop star a shit pile of dough and he refuses to self-destruct, I think it is a bit wet,\" said a smoking, slicked-back, black-sunglasses-clad Bono in a 1993 interview on the UK music show \"Naked City\". \"I think it's part of the deal. If they don't die on a cross by 33, I'd ask for your money back.\" Like many of the knowingly audacious quotes from the singer and his U2 mates during this period, it's a little tough to deduce the exact level of sincerity involved. And that was the whole idea. In the early 1990s, U2 were sending up the idea of a \"rock'n'roll star.\" They were offering themselves as an ironic, postmodern band for similarly confused times. They were making fun of themselves and their own humorless, slate-faced 80s reputation.</p><p>A year after Bono's casual quip about pop stars dying on a cross, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And in Nirvana's final video, for \"Heart-Shaped Box\", Cobain could be seen making wild eyes in front of one. Achtung Baby and its accompanying Zoo TV tour lived within the slippage between perception and reality. \"Sometimes you can get far closer to the truth of what you're trying to say by highlighting what it isn't as if it were true,\" said the Edge on \"Naked City\". \"That's assuming we know the truth-- 'truth' is one of those words that's lost its meaning.\" In the 80's, U2 seemed endlessly in search of a definite truth, whether in peace or god or love or some ambiguous combination of the three. Famously, they didn't find it. But the quest was thrilling-- at least until 1988's album and film Rattle and Hum, which found the group looking and sounding spectacularly self-serious while gawkily paying tribute to some of their American heroes like Elvis Presley and B.B. King. The resulting critical backlash caused these open-hearted Irishmen to reflect, and they weren't crazy about what they saw in the mirror. \"We looked like a big, overblown rock band running amok,\" says Bono in an excellent new documentary called From the Sky Down that chronicles the band's pivotal turn-of-the-decade moment. And while that might seem like an aptly derisive opinion of today's incarnation of U2, it's important to remember that these guys originally came out of the cacophony of rule-breaking post-punk, a realm where bloated arena rock was the enemy.</p><p>So they went away and tried to come up with a new way to seek some truth. Achtung Baby is rightly known as one of rock's greatest reinventions because it was so complete. Sure, U2 changed their sound from chiming melodics to lurching, distorted rhythm. But they also changed their attitude, their demeanor, their look, their ideas on how to deal with celebrity. All of a sudden, they were funny, sexy, a bit dangerous-- three things few would've associated with U2 in the 80's. And yet, at their core, the band's values remained constant. They were still ethically minded and interested in the real-life connection between living beings. But the way they went about projecting those core tenets flipped. In TV-news parlance, their attitude switched from \"60 Minutes\" to \"The Colbert Report\".This new era was conveniently spelled-out on Achtung's first single \"The Fly\" with the Edge's metallic skronk and Bono's conspiratorial, effected whisper of lines like, \"It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest/ It's no secret that ambition bites the nails of success.\" And just as the album goes lengths to both fulfill and upend rock'n'roll myths with thorny tales of deep betrayal, questioned fidelity, and ambiguous artifice, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it, too.</p><p>Take the album's much-ballyhooed place of origin, Berlin's Hansa Studios. This was the location that played host to David Bowie and Iggy Pop's electronic-inspired masterworks Low and The Idiot. And Hansa is located near the Berlin Wall, which had only recently been breached when U2 set up there in the fall of 1990. Perched literally in the middle of historic liberation, U2 were meant to find inspiration in the world events around them and turn that spark into a new version of the band for a new decade. It's a great backdrop for a great story. But it didn't really go down that way. \"We're there, and greatness has left the building,\" Bono recalls in From the Sky Down, which features the band returning to Hansa earlier this year in preparation for their headlining set at Glastonbury. While Berlin did inspire bits of the record-- \"Zoo Station\" was named after one of its prominent train terminals-- it hardly lived up to its lofty reputation. This serves as a lesson for U2, a band that shamelessly worships past rock heroes, to move past such naïve mythologizing. \"Berlin was a baptism of fire,\" says bassist Adam Clayton in the documentary. \"It was something we had to go through to realize what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city-- that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down.\" This newfound pragmatism would help them to move past their fantasies about the sanctity of rock. So while Berlin played a part on Achtung Baby, it did so in surprising ways; though \"One\" was mostly written in a burst of inspiration in Hansa, most of the album truly came together once the group went back home to Dublin. Most of the audio bonuses in this set are unfortunately superfluous, and don't offer much in terms of insight.</p><p>There are two CDs filled with dance remixes, and while U2 were at the vanguard of big time rock bands embracing the notion of the remix, even the most devout rave nostalgist would have little use for six remakes of \"Mysterious Ways\". The disc of bonus material and B-sides is disappointingly slight, and another filled with early versions of every song on Achtung offers a few revelations-- an Irish jig-style version of \"Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World\" has an easy charm, but generally, it's easy to see why these attempts were improved upon later. Achtung's even more electronic and weirder follow-up, 1993's Zooropa-- which was recorded in a creative frenzy during a break in the Zoo TV tour-- is also included, though it's generally (and somewhat unfairly) glossed over in all the accompanying materials. The worthy additions in this \"super deluxe edition\" are nearly all visual. There's Anton Corbijn's gorgeous and colorful photography that covers its case, as well as a big, sturdy 84-page book. And then the four discs of video: It Might Get Loud director Davis Guggenheim's new 90-minute doc From the Sky Down, every video from the era, a full live gig taped in Australia in 1993, interview shows (like \"Naked City\"), and, best of all, a playfully subversive TV special from 1992 that includes live footage from the Zoo TV tour as well as goofy interludes that play up the surrealism and insanity of the whole project. Moments like the \"Even Better Than the Real Thing\" video, with the band playing in a glass case while fans look on outside, successfully tie in all the pomo flourishes U2 were chasing.</p><p>The group was at the forefront of bringing huge video screens into the live arena, and some of the tricks they pull off-- Bono \"dueting\" with a static-y Lou Reed or flipping channels to live local stations-- still look impressive. And for all the technical wizardry of the stage setup, the band still uses it to complement the music rather than overshadow it. Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band-- including U2 itself-- has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way. In the Zoo TV special, which originally aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, a \"news commentator\" covering the show dubs it \"the most significant and exciting TV event since the Gulf War.\" Some of the ideas behind Zoo TV and Achtung Baby were inspired by the television coverage of that initial Gulf War in 1991, and the bizarre reality of being able to switch channels from home shopping to MTV to the bombing of Baghdad. U2 recognized the dangers of this idea, when war turned into just more filler for the burgeoning 24-hour TV-news cycle. And instead of preaching against it in a high and mighty fashion, they embraced that chaos in an effort to expose it. Of course, our collective information overload has been upped exponentially since thanks to the internet, making the flashes of words and slogans that backed U2 during their live campaign seem eerily prophetic. Talking about the Zoo TV audience in the \"Naked City\" interview, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. says, \"They're coming to a rock'n'roll show and watching television, what more can you ask for?\" He's joking, but as we go to arenas and see singers on big screens through our cellphone cameras, the question begins to answer itself.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Ryan Dombal, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Less experimental and more song-oriented than Zooropa, Pop attempts to sell the glitzy rush of techno to an audience weaned on arena rock. And that audience includes U2 themselves. While they never sound like they don't believe in what they're doing, they still remove most of the radical elements of electronic dance, which is evident to anyone with just a passing knowledge of the Chemical Brothers and Underworld. To a new listener, Pop has flashes of surprise -- particularly on the rampaging \"Mofo\" -- but underneath the surface, U2 rely on anthemic rockers and ballads. \"Discotheque\" might be a little clumsy, but \"Staring at the Sun\" shimmers with synthesizers borrowed from Massive Attack and a Noel Gallagher chorus. Similarly, \"Do You Feel Loved\" and \"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\" fuse old-fashioned U2 dynamism with a keen sense of the cool eroticism that makes trip-hop so alluring. Problems arise when the group tries to go for conventional rock songs, some of which are symptomatic of the return of U2's crusade for salvation. Pop is inflected with the desire for a higher power to save the world from its jaded spiral of decay and immorality, which is why the group's embrace of dance music never seems joyous -- instead of providing an intoxicating rush of gloss and glamour, it functions as a backdrop for a plea of salvation. Achtung Baby also was a comment on the numbing isolation of modern culture, but it made sweeping statements through personal observations; Pop makes sweeping statements through sweeping observations. The difference is what makes Pop an easy record to admire, but a hard one to love. </p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Nearly ten years after beginning U2 Mach II with their brilliant seventh album Achtung Baby, U2 ease into their third phase with 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind. The title signifies more than it seems, since the group sifts through its past, working with Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, all in an effort to construct a classicist U2 album. Thankfully, it's a rock record from a band that absorbed all the elastic experimentation, studio trickery, dance flirtations, and genre bending of Achtung, Zooropa, and Pop &mdash; all they've shed is the irony. U2 choose not to delve as darkly personal as they did on Achtung or Zooropa, yet they also avoid the alienating archness of Pop, returning to the generous spirit that flowed through their best '80s records. On that level, All may be reminiscent of The Joshua Tree, but this is a clever and craftsmanlike record, filled with nifty twists in the arrangements, small sonic details, and colors. U2 take subtle risks, such as their best pure pop song ever with \"Wild Honey\"; they're so self-confident they effortlessly write their best anthem in years with \"Beautiful Day\"; they offer the gospel-influenced \"Stuck in a Moment,\" never once lowering it to the shtick it would have been on Rattle and Hum. Like any work from craftsmen, All That You Can't Leave Behind winds up being a work of modest pleasures, where the way the verse eases into the chorus means more than the overall message, and this is truly the first U2 album where that sentiment applies -- but there is genuine pleasure in their craft, for the band and listener alike.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><p>The title can work both ways. For the band, \"all that you can't leave behind\" implies facing up to their platinum salad days of the Edge's trademark echo shimmers and Paul \"Bono Vox\" Hewson's Lexus-honk vocals. For the general public, the title reifies our struggle to leave behind the image of Bono hatching from a disco lemon, dressed in that rayon six-pack t-shirt. For a band settled into four-letter pseudonyms from their 1980 debut, breaking up never seemed like an option. From day one, U2 was a rock constellation&mdash;a warplane&mdash;and we expected epics. It's an early affair, a hazy infatuation, that has since bloated into comfortable taking-for-granted. As with all ubiquitous products, the familiarity of logos, slogans, and icons eventually supplants whatever original feelings we may have had.</p><p>U2 are, indeed, a universal product, much like the Catholic Church Bono humbly admires. The swoosh on The Edge's skully cap, and the golden arches of Bono's glasses spring to mind. Song titles and lyrics on All That boldly declare familiar, safe dogma and generic commandments, such as \"Grace\", \"Peace on Earth\", \"I believe in you,\" \"Won't you take me, take me please,\" \"I know it aches, and your heart breaks,\" etc. This new batch of songs heralds a conscious and welcome revocation of dance-inflected bubbleglam, but scales back too far. In searching so hard for their souls, U2 have hacked away their flesh and skull, leaving a lobotomized approximation of glory.</p><p>\"Beautiful Day\" opens with bombast after a cheeky keyboard tease, and peaks with Bono's cracking voice in the shouted coda: \"What you don't have - You don't need it now!\" And so the album climaxes at 3xBD minutes. The gospel ballad, \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\", maintains the buzz admirably, again peaking in the coda with Brian Eno's faux-brass keyboard belts. Elsewhere, Eno's fingerprints remain undusted. The album could have benefited from more of him; apparently, it takes Brian Eno + Berlin to = renaissance.</p><p>\"Elevation\" slaughters hope with reckless chops of the hackneyed sword, as Bono commits songwriting faux pas #1: rhyming \"sky\" with \"fly\" and \"high.\" The details will be spared, but you can work it out. Damn you, God and aerodynamics, for making altitude a necessity for flight, in the sky, which happens to be above us. As the album's sticker proclaims, \"Walk On\" is locked and loaded as the second single. Epic midtempo should always follow punchy power-rock, you see. Nice, but unexciting. Here, Bono seems dead set on ruining U2's return with clichés. Minutes after the aforementioned poetic gaffe, he returns with, \"A singing bird in a cage - Who will only fly - Fly for freedom.\" That little bird is you, guys! Free yourself from your cage! For freedom!</p><p>The record stomps around in this valley before mounting another two-song peak with \"In a Little While\" and \"Wild Honey\". On the former, the vulnerability of Bono's \"vox\" makes a welcome return from minute 3:30 to inject some heartfelt emotion into the tingling doo-wop. \"That girl! - That girl! - She's mine,\" Bono bellows with larynx scratches, evoking the dead spirit of Van Morrison. \"Wild Honey\" similarly ob-la-dis like a giddy Van, and somehow escapes the shame of Bono declaring, \"I was a monkey.\" Testament to the band there.</p><p>But it's back into the dark nadir until the album's closer. Bono joins hands with Sinead O'Connor in healing the world on the tepid carol, \"Peace on Earth\". \"Jesus, can you take the time - To throw a drowning man a line,\" Bono asks. Hey, if the world is so dark, take off your sunglasses. Bono's Healing Heart takes a \"look at the world\" on the next track, and discovers that people \"feel all kinds of things.\" Indeed.</p><p>But not even Tom Waits' grizzled pipes could salvage the atrocity of \"New York\". Over one of the best musical beds he's ever been offered, Bono weaves a Hallmark lover's tale, in the city where \"Irish, Italians - Jews, and Hispanics - Religious nuts and political fanatics - Stir in the stew - Happily - Not like me and you.\" Subtle breakbeat drumming and glistening guitar be damned, Bono will ruin a song. And so the story goes for the entire album&mdash;one of the band's finest, if not for the tweeting and hooting of The Fly and his grating lyrics. Beautiful day, certainly, but the rest of the week was all jetlag and rain. Can't The Edge sing, too?</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Brent Dicrescenzo, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

U2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle marks the joyous return of Ireland's top band at the close of their 2001 Elevation Tour. This DVD, the second video release from the same tour, was filmed in early September at Slane Castle, where U2 previously recorded The Unforgettable Fire. The band's transition from being an opening act in 1981 to a headliner in 2001 helps make this performance special, as does the fact that Ireland had earned a spot in the 2002 World Cup several hours before U2 took the stage. As a result, Live from Slane Castle captures the band at their best, playing a mix of old staples and All That You Can't Leave Behind-era hits to an ecstatic audience that sings along to every word. \"Out of Control\" sounds as sharp as it did in 1980, and \"Beautiful Day\" could possibly be the band's best stadium anthem ever. Spending time with this concert package will leave you grinning from ear to ear -- not only because you like U2 -- but because they've convinced you once again that they're the best rock & roll band in the world. [Bonus interactive material, as well as a digitally remastered version of The Unforgettable Fire documentary, is also included in this DVD set.

Ever since they hit the big time in 1987 with The Joshua Tree, every album is a response to the last — rather, a response to the response, a way to correct the mistakes of the last album: Achtung Baby erased the roots rock experiment Rattle and Hum, All That You Can't Leave Behind straightened out the fumbling Pop, and 2009's No Line on the Horizon is a riposte to the suggestion they played it too safe on 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. After recording two new cuts with Rick Rubin for the '06 compilation U218 and flirting with will.i.am, U2 reunited with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois (here billed as \"Danny\" for some reason), who not only produced The Joshua Tree but pointed the group toward aural architecture on The Unforgettable Fire. Much like All That You Can't and Atomic Bomb, which were largely recorded with their first producer, Steve Lillywhite, this is a return to the familiar for U2, but where their Lillywhite LPs are characterized by muscle, the Eno/Lanois records are where the band take risks, and so it is here that U2 attempts to recapture that spacy, mysterious atmosphere of The Unforgettable Fire and then take it further. Contrary to the suggestion of the clanking, sputtering first single \"Get on Your Boots\" — its riffs and \"Pump It Up\" chant sounding like a cheap mashup stitched together in GarageBand — this isn't a garish, gaudy electro-dalliance in the vein of Pop. Apart from a stilted middle section — \"Boots,\" the hamfisted white-boy funk \"Stand Up Comedy,\" and the not-nearly-as-bad-as-its-title anthem \"I'll Go Crazy if I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\"; tellingly, the only three songs here to not bear co-writing credits from Eno and Lanois — No Line on the Horizon is all austere grey tones and midtempo meditation. It's a record that yearns to be intimate but U2 don't do intimate, they only do majestic, or as Bono sings on one of the albums best tracks, they do \"Magnificent.\" Here, as on \"No Line on the Horizon\" and \"Breathe,\" U2 strike that unmistakable blend of soaring, widescreen sonics and unflinching openhearted emotion that's been their trademark, turning the intimate into something hauntingly universal. These songs resonate deeper and longer than anything on Atomic Bomb, their grandeur almost seeming effortless. It's the rest of the record that illustrates how difficult it is to sound so magnificent. With the exception of that strained middle triptych, the rest of the album is in the vein of \"No Line on the Horizon\", \"Magnificent\" and \"Breathe,\" only quieter and unfocused, with its ideas drifting instead of gelling. Too often, the album whispers in a murmur so quiet it's quite easy to ignore — \"White as Snow,\" an adaptation of a traditional folk tune, and \"Cedars of Lebanon,\" its verses not much more than a recitation, simmer so slowly they seem to evaporate — but at least these poorly defined subtleties sustain the hazily melancholy mood of No Line on the Horizon. When U2, Eno, and Lanois push too hard — the ill-begotten techno-speak overload of \"Unknown Caller,\" the sound sculpture of \"Fez-Being Born\" — the ideas collapse like a pyramid of cards, the confusion amplifying the aimless stretches of the album, turning it into a murky muddle. Upon first listen, No Line on the Horizon seems as if it would be a classic grower, an album that makes sense with repeated spins, but that repetition only makes the album more elusive, revealing not that U2 went into the studio with a dense, complicated blueprint, but rather, they had no plan at all.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Why U2? How did these four Irishmen become the blueprint for every band with stadium aspirations? The Edge's churchly guitar chime&mdash;which thrives on the same arena acoustics that can turn otherwise booming bands into mud&mdash;is certainly a factor. So is their weakness for the big gesture&mdash;whether it be a giant lemon, heart, or mouth. And Bono's cathartic mix of modern panacea&mdash;love, God, mass culture&mdash;gives them a reach to the back row and beyond. But, perhaps above all else, the band's restlessness and willingness to challenge both themselves and their patrons is why the Killers, Kanye West, and Coldplay want to be the next U2 and not the next AC/DC. It's why these four Irishmen still represent the punk spirit decades after they emerged from it.</p><p>\"You've got to balance being relevant and commenting on something that's happening today with trying to attain timelessness,\" philosophized the Edge in the early 1990s. The quote sounds like rock star bullshit...until you realize that's pretty much what U2 did for 20 years. From 1980 to 2000, it was difficult to tell exactly what the next U2 album would sound like. Briefly: They added atmosphere to new wave, looked for God and found hits, exhumed their rock'n'roll heroes, sent-up those same heroes while losing their religion, and punctured pop via mutated techno. Each move was more audacious than the last&mdash;even 1997 knee-jerk victim Pop saw the world-beating act taking completely unnecessary musical and financial risks in the name of Warholian post-modern pastiche. They then also managed to surprise on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind by successfully returning to form after shrugging off the notion for so many years. But 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and its subsequent tour were troubling.</p><p>That record saw four guys famous for dabbing classic rock into all sorts of impressionistic frames (or dismantling it entirely via Village People costumes) uncomfortably grasping for old-fashioned riffs, when they weren't mindlessly feasting on their own past. It was completely predictable (\"City of Blinding Lights\"), canned (\"Vertigo\"), and depressingly Sting-like (\"A Man and a Woman\"). But the group did little to hide the fact that they were basking in their early-century comeback's afterglow; in concert, in place of the ATYCLB tour's heart-shaped runway was a, um, circle-shaped runway. Still self-aware enough to sense stagnation, the quartet began to work on what would become No Line on the Horizon with new producer Rick Rubin and an imperative to break all those piling U2 trappings once again. As Bono told The New York Times this week: \"When you become a comfortable, reliable friend, I'm not sure that's the place for rock'n'roll.\"</p><p>Sixteen years ago, U2 worked a snippet of Public Enemy's \"Don't Believe the Hype\" into their technologically prescient Zoo TV tour&mdash;perhaps fans should heed that bit of sampled advice right about now. Because while this group of slick talkers may have set out to expand their own definition once more, they've ended up with old collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois --along with an album that's neither relevant nor timeless.</p><p>First single \"Get on Your Boots\" is a worrisome harbinger&mdash;to call it a mess would be generous. The song combines sub-Audioslave riffs with Escape Club's \"Wild Wild West\" and sounds more disjointed than the worst Girl Talk rip off. \"I don't wanna talk about wars between nations&mdash;not right now!\" claims Bono on the song, before extolling the virtues of tight leather boots. His off-the-cuff attitude and delivery suggests a cheekiness missing from U2's music for more than a decade, but it's a red herring. While other tracks like \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\" and \"Stand Up Comedy\" feature knowing lines that examine the singer's faults and hypocrisy, the album is heavy on half-assed word-salad characterizations and the sort of meaningless platitudes Bono used to be so great at (barely) avoiding. And there's a strong theme of resignation running through the record; whereas many classic U2 tracks have come from Bono's struggle with faith and certainty, he seems content to give up agency on songs like \"Moment of Surrender\" and \"Unknown Caller\". \"I've found grace inside a sound,\" he sings on \"Breathe\", and the line seems like a cop-out from a man who spent so much time struggling with salvation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms (the three-note ring Edge nicks from \"Walk On\" for \"Unknown Caller\", the \"oh oh oh\" outro from \"Stay\" apparently copied and pasted into \"Moment of Surrender\", etc.). While Eno used to work his unique sound-bobbles and ambiance into the fabric of U2 songs, he seems content to offer spacey intros totally disassociated from their accompanying tunes here (see: \"Fez - Being Born\", \"Magnificent\"). And oftentimes the band mistakes risk-taking for ill-fated arrangements and decisions. \"Surrender\"&mdash;reportedly improvised in one seven-minute take&mdash;comes across as lazy indulgence, and the title track's hard-nosed verse is torpedoed by its deflating fart of a hook. As the go-to sonic innovator of the group, the Edge dials in a particularly dispiriting performance throughout; his rare solos usually pack in enough panache to fill stadiums but his bluesy blah of a spotlight on \"Surrender\" would barely satisfy a single earbud.</p><p>\"It keeps getting harder. You're playing against yourself and you don't want to lose,\" Adam Clayton told Q last month. And he's got a point. After nearly 30 years of chart crashing and sell-outs, starting afresh can't be easy. There's only one \"One\". In a way, U2 spoiled their followers by consistently questioning themselves while writing songs that straddled the personal and collective consciousness. But Horizon is clearly playing not to lose&mdash;it's a defensive gesture, and a rather pitiful one at that.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Ryan Dombal, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

The performances (which, Marriner notes, crucially served as templates during actual production) have also been augmented to match the expanded new video edition and include a new, 2001 recording of the Adagio in C Minor for Glass Armonica, K. 617.</p><b><I>--Jerry McCulley</I></b>"

		"review": "<p>Peter Gabriel's score for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, released as the album Passion, was a fair introduction to world music forms for the complete novice, as the music was filtered through Gabriel's more accessible western pop sensibility. The far superior Passion - Sources (the first release on Gabriel's incipient Real World label) presents the original performances that inspired Gabriel's music, and as such is both a handy second step for those intrigued by the soundtrack and an entertaining collection for the more experienced world music fan. Due to the physical location and spiritual themes of the film, Gabriel's source material focuses on the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern Asia and incorporates much religious and ceremonial music. Strict purists have balked about this collection, as it includes one fairly dire piece of Indian pop music by Shankar & the Epidemics, shortens some tracks (most unfortunately, a spine-tingling performance by the great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, cut from over 11 minutes to not quite five), and overdubs some of Gabriel's musical associates onto others, like Manu Katche's somewhat distracting percussion overdubs on an otherwise enchanting Moroccan wedding song. For most listeners, however, these will be only minor annoyances, and there are plenty of \"purer\" representations of these musics available. Passion - Sources is in most ways an exemplary collection that did much to launch Real World as one of the most viable high-profile world music labels in the world.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stewart Mason</strong></p>"

The album starts out with a Who piece that makes good use of the Bo Diddley beat. An instrumental piece from His Name Is Alive follows. The Who make another appearance with the slower \"Gettin' in Tune,\" and Elvis' \"Pocketful of Rainbows,\" complete with laughing outtakes, allows a lighter moment. Neil Young's thumping \"World on a String\" kicks the energy back up some small amount, before some much lighter work, including Nancy Wilson's contributions specifically made for the movie and Bruce Springsteen's \"Secret Garden.\" Paul McCartney's dual songs are presented afterwards, with a finale of Bob Dylan's \"Shelter From the Storm.\" There's a definite leaning towards the classics of rock & roll here, though the softer side is presented in most cases. As such, it's nice for its coherence, as well as the alternate version of Dylan's song and the outtakes from Elvis.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Adam Greenberg</b></p>"

Organized and executive-produced by Peter Case, this contains covers of the Mississippi bluesman's songs by more than a dozen medium-big and very-big names from the folk and rock worlds, including Beck, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle (dueting with Justin Earle), Ben Harper, Peter Case & Dave Alvin (performing together), Geoff Muldaur, Gillian Welch, and John Hiatt. It's more a folk-rock-blues crossover album than a Delta blues one, which is fine: tribute albums shouldn't be re-creations of the originals, and whether or not it was the intention, it will expose some of John Hurt's songs to fans who identify themselves primarily as folk or rock listeners. And not many of these songs are very well-known, with the exception of \"Candy Man\" (done by Steve & Justin Earle) and \"Stagolee\" (sung by Beck). The arrangements are low-key and respectful, the best ones being Ben Harper's \"Sliding Delta\" (which is one of the bluesiest performances) and Victoria Williams' \"Since I've Laid My Burden Down,\" which has very eccentric banjo sounds.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Richie Unterberger</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>In its first teaser trailers, when it was still going to be released as a single film, <I>Kill Bill</I> was sold with the immortal teaser \"In the year 2003 Uma Thurman  is going to Kill Bill.\" Of course, Uma  didn't come close to the messy business of killing Bill until early 2004, when the second part of Quentin Tarantino's grindhouse epic <I>Kill Bill</I> was released, but she sure started to kill in <I>Kill Bill, Vol. 1</I>, where the Bride, the character she created with QT , began her arduous revenge upon the five former colleagues that killed her fiancée at her wedding rehearsal, then left her for dead at the altar.</p><p>As Tarantino  plot lines go, this is the simplest yet, but revenge movies shouldn't be encumbered by deep subtext. Instead, he divided the film into chapters, giving him opportunity to play with both time and location, and then decided to shoot each chapter as a homage to a different kind of exploitation film — something that's reflected in the soundtrack. After Nancy Sinatra's torchy \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" and Charlie Feathers' tough, swaggering rockabilly chestnut \"That Certain Female\" set the story and the mood, the record is devoted primarily to instrumental pieces that range from surging epics to the calm kitsch of Zamfir's \"The Lonely Shepherd,\" to the intense funk pastiche of Tomoyasu Hotei's \"Battle Without Honor or Humanity\" (the song that kicks off nearly every trailer and ad for <I>Kill Bill</I>).</p><p>The reduced presence of dialogue from the film — a hallmark of Tarantino  soundtracks — is a reflection of the film, which places emphasis on action and visuals. Hell, even the tracks on the soundtrack have minimal lyrics, consisting largely of instrumentals. This gives it more of a meandering feeling, and the soundtrack kind of peters out, ending in two quick excerpts of futuristic electro music by Quincy Jones  and Neu!, then a gaggle of sound effects and kung fu hits. Nevertheless, its cavalcade of contradictory moods has its own coherence, and is more <I>musical</I> than most pop music soundtracks. Plus, this has <I>no</I> familiar material, nor does it have anything that would be a single on Clear Channel, which is why it works as an album of its own — it doesn't just reflect the movie; it follows its own logic, and displays fearless imagination. It makes you hungry for <I>Vol. 2</I>, both the movie and soundtrack. — <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B></p>"

		"review": "<P><SPAN class=BouPrimaryBody>As an astute businessman, Antonio Vivaldi wanted to ensure he got the best possible quality of printing and the highest circualtion for the works he decided to publish. So he naturally turned to the extremely efficient publishing houses of Amsterdam for his collections of concertos opus 3 (<I>L'estro armonico</I>, 1711) and 4 (<I>La stravaganza</I>, 1714), among others. Success was not long in coming - both he and the Venetian concerto of which he was the mosy brilliant representative quickly achieved fame all over Europe. To such an extent that very soon, at the little German court of Saxe-Weimar, a young <I>Kapellmeister</I> by the name of Johan Sebastian Bach studied them carefully, even transcribing for harpsichord some of the finest specimens, which were to inspire him in his own compositions... The scene is set for this appealing new CD by Rinaldo Alessandrini, whose Vivaldian and Bachian credentials need no underlining: one need only recall his splendid recital of Bach's harpsichord music \"<I>all'italiana</I>\". Here, with his ensemble Concerto Italiano (which celebrates its twentieth anniversary in 2005), not content with presenting the original versions of four magnificent concertos that attracted the attention of Bach the transcriber (two of them composed by talented Marcello brothers), not to mention the celebrated flute concerto <I>La notte</I>,&nbsp;Alessandrini offers us the added bonus of his own reconstruction of Bach's \"Italian Concerto\" in what may have been its first version, now lost. Thus the masterpiece for solo harpsichord here becomes a \"real\" concerto for violon and strings, whose leaping vigour and exemplary transparency are totally convincing. Here is the transcriber transcribed - with delightful results!</SPAN></P><P><HR><BR>The Baroque era? Just a bunch of dead guys' dead music. It was three centuries ago, for example, that Bach transcribed some Venetian violin concertos into works for solo harpsichord. (Big deal.) But what if you reversed the process? What if you turned Bach's harpsichord piece \"after the Italian taste\" into a violin concerto and restored the lost violin parts of some of Bach's transcriptions? Presto, you'd have some brand-new Baroque music, thematically arranged.<BR>Concerto Italiano and its director, Rinaldo Alessandrini, have done just that -- and created marvels. Listen for the use of staccato and silence in the two slow movements of Benedetto Marcello's second Concerti a cinque; the contrast between the serene Adagio and the festive Presto in his brother Alessandro's exquisite oboe concerto; and the second of Vivaldi's amazingly innovative flute concertos, with its creepy \"Night\" and hypnotic \"Sleep\" sections.<BR>In 2003, Gramophone declared that Concerto Italiano's version of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons was the finest ever recorded. The pristine Naive Classique recording of Concerti Italiani will similarly raise your spirits -- along with those of a few dead guys.<BR>-Michael Bowen<BR><I>The Inlander</I>, Spokane, Washington - November 2004 (USA)<BR><BR><HR>&nbsp;<BR><P><B><A href=\"http://www.andante.com/boutique/shop/index.cfm?action=displaycatalog&amp;iProductLabelID=&amp;by=composer&amp;iConcPeopleID=1767&amp;vFirstName=Benedetto&amp;vLastName=Marcello&amp;vSection=Benedetto%20Marcello\"><FONT color=#000000>Benedetto Marcello</FONT></A></B><BR>1-4 Concerto in mi minore per violino obligato, violoncello, archi e basso continuo (<I>concerti a cinque</I>, op.I, Venezia, 1708) 10:18 <BR><P>-ricostruzione della parte di violino obbligato a cura di Rinaldo Alessandrini -</P><BR>Recorded in September 2000 in Chiesa della SS.

The music you hear on THE PANEL CDs is exactly as it was captured live on the night, no safety nets, no ropes and nothing up their sleeves!</p><p>When inviting musicians to perform on THE PANEL, there is only one rule: that their song be played at the desk and played acoustically - okay that's two rules but they were both important. No other locally produced programme has ever continually drawn out of musicians such intimate, occasionally raw, yet always unique performances.</p><p>These performances covering a diverse range of both local and international musicians and musical styles- What other album would have the biggest Australian band in the world today - Jet, alongside one of Australia's great Indie talents John Butler Trio and internationally acclaimed David Gray, Jamie Cullum and Joe Cocker!</p><p>What is the common thread that links all these performances together? - THE PANEL's Rob Sitch says. \"I think all performers like the chance to be \"Unplugged\". Occasionally this happened mid-song and against their will and for that we apologise. We'll gaffer tape the cables next year.\".</p><p>TV being a technical medium so many variables can come into play to sabotage a performance no matter how well rehearsed and prepared it may be! Maybe it was the vibe emanating from The Panel regulars whose respect for all of their guests puts them at ease, or the intimate set where the studio audience is almost within touching distance. Maybe it was the policy that absolutely no compromises would be made when providing each of the musicians with the best possible sound. Whatever the reason, the many acts who appear on The Panel, without exception, turn in outstanding performances on the night, and have preserved for us on this 4th CD, indelible moments of their musical talent.</p>"

The kitsch factor dominating the rest of said series is basically gone with all the bands here simply doing unplugged versions of fan's favorite songs, and the record is the predictable result of pop-punkers turning off their amps and adding in the occasional piano and handclap for good measure. Fans of acts like Silverstein and the Audition will be smitten all the way through, though really, some songs work much better than others, stripped down and without the driving chords to cover up oft-nasal vocals. Jack's Mannequin's \"Bruised\" is unsurprisingly a standout, since Andrew McMahon is heads above his peers anyways, but newcomers All Time Low bring an unexpectedly solid performance by doing, well, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Mixing up the emo-heavy crowd a bit, Set Your Goals' great \"Echoes\" stands tall as a punchy little melodic hardcore number that recalls early New Found Glory, while vets Anti-Flag can barely contain their anger at the Bush administration over the strummed notes of \"Welcome to 1984.\" These songs — along with a rather whimsical version of Say Anything's \"Woe\" and a laid-back, barebones All-American Rejects number — are welcome respite from the album's generally consistent nature, not to mention the grating screamo-lite of Alesana and a rather boring cut from Sherwood. Perfectly inoffensive and agreeable \"punk\" ready for late-night make-out sessions between a boy and girl most likely wearing the same sized jeans.</P><P>— <B>Corey Apar</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>Between 1971 and 1987, BBC television's The Old Grey Whistle Test was crucial viewing for any \"serious\" rock fan, a weekly digest of live performance, concert footage, interviews, and news, presented for most of that run by the gently bearded whisper of DJ Bob Harris. It was never a show that chased headlines -- although Whistle Test can claim to have launched some of the most incandescent talents of the early '70s, from Alice Cooper, who made his first U.K. TV appearance on the show, to Focus, hitherto an unknown Dutch prog act, it was just as notable for the acts it didn't feature as for those it did. No \"pop\" groups, no Top 40 hypes, nothing that at least one member of the production team wouldn't trust with his life. The result, though the show itself drifted in and out of critical and public favor throughout its 16-year run, is today regarded among the most crucial British rock archives in existence, and the two DVDs that comprise this package highlight at least a fraction of the jewels therein. The 45 exclusive performances stretching across the show's entire run do indeed include the most epochal showings, with the first disc traveling through the first half of the 1970s, a gold mine of thinking man's rock -- Focus, of course, whipping up a frenzied (and festive) \"Hocus Pocus,\" show favorites the Sensational Alex Harvey Band hamming it up with \"Give My Compliments to the Chef,\" the Wailers' spellbinding romp through \"Stir It Up,\" and an absolutely epic rendition of \"Frankenstein\" from the Edgar Winter Group.</p> <p>There's room, too, for a couple of the bands that Harris himself furiously fought against including on the show, only to be outvoted by his teammates -- nobody who saw them will ever forget the scorn and disgust with which the staid and serious Harris introduced the decidedly glamorous novelty of Roxy Music and the New York Dolls, and there's a school of thought that actually credits his outrage with laying the foundations of punk rock a few years later. Harris represented the establishment; Roxy (and the Dolls) were the future. If you liked one, you couldn't trust the other. Harris himself had departed Whistle Test by the time the show itself was ready to embrace punk -- he presided over a handful more begrudging nods in that direction, including the blistering performances from Dr. Feelgood and Otway & Barrett that appear here, but it was with the arrival of hostess Annie Nightingale that the show (and this collection) moved into the new age. Talking Heads, XTC, Blondie, the Damned, Public Image, and the Teardrop Explodes all highlight disc two, although there's still room for the traditional Whistle Test audience. Meat Loaf turned in a phenomenal \"Paradise By the Dashboard Lights,\" there's some stunning footage of Bruce Springsteen, Robert Wyatt turns in a heartbreaking \"Shipbuilding,\" and R.E.M. -- possibly the one band in the '80s that wholly epitomized the spirit of the show in the '70s -- takes a suitably po-faced trip down \"Moon River.\" Bonus material includes personal recollections from the show's hosts (a wealth of entertaining trivia) and a clutch of interviews from the show's golden years: Lennon, Led Zeppelin, Keith Richard, Elton John. In addition, producer Mike Appleton delivers a vastly enjoyable audio commentary, while there's also a smattering of still-photo features. At the end of the day, though, it's the music that made The Old Grey Whistle Test what it was, and the music -- close to five hours of it -- that renders this collection such an essential document.</p>&mdash; <b>Dave Thompson</b>"

Vaughan may have been the new news, but King was not suffering, either. He had a world-class supporting band and was playing as well as he ever had. In other words, the stage was set for a fiery, exciting concert and that's exactly what they delivered. Vaughan was clearly influenced by King -- there are King licks all over his first two recorded efforts, and it was an influence that stayed with him to the end -- and he was unafraid to go toe-to-toe with his idol. King must have been impressed, since In Session never devolves into a mere cutting contest. Instead, each musicians spurs the other to greater heights. For aficionados of either guitarist, that means the album isn't just worth a listen -- it means that it's a record that sounds as exciting on each subsequent listen as does the first time through.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Released in 2001, Live at Montreux 1982 & 1985 was a historically significant Stevie Ray Vaughan recording in purely audio form, but the 2004 DVD release ups the ante by providing video footage of both sets. The 1982 show is essentially the show that got his career started. He met both Jackson Browne and David Bowie after his set, and they were so impressed that Browne volunteered use of his studio (for free!) for Stevie to record what would become his debut album, and Bowie recruited him as lead guitarist for the Let's Dance album and tour (alas, the tour was not to be). However, not everyone was so impressed. In fact, there are choruses of boos that follow nearly every tune. Vaughan was basically a nobody at the time, playing very electric blues at the end of a mostly acoustic program. But he had done enough bar gigs to completely rise above it, and he plays with the passion and hunger of a young musician getting his big chance. He's not really an engaging frontman at this point in his career, but man, can he play that guitar. And he simply never lets up. Even at this stage, his tone and style are pretty close to fully formed, and it's easy to see how he could become the guitar hero he ended up being.</p><p>The 1985 show is quite a contrast. Vaughan had become a star, and it shows in so many ways. He had developed more of a stage persona, with showier moves and infinitely more presence as a frontman. He's also dressed to the hilt, looking like some sort of '80s cowboy-pimp with a ridiculous hat, multiple scarfs, and gigantic earring. Heck, even Whipper Layton is sporting fancier '80s pants and a big earring, and Tommy Shannon's hat is more extravagant than the 1982 show as well. Double Trouble also now included Reese Wynans on keyboards, which, along with Vaughan's addition of a wah-wah pedal, really expanded the sound. Vaughan has many fiery moments on this set as well, but he also loses focus during several solos, and seems more than content to share or even hand over the spotlight to fellow Texas guitar legend Johnny Copeland. Vaughan seems a bit worn out, and it wouldn't be long before he got sober. Even so, there are clear moments of brilliance and this time the audience is fully behind him. Live at Montreux 1982 & 1985 is a vital document for fans, showing the raw ingredients that would make him a star, then comparing it to what happened once he got there. The video is great, with multiple angles throughout (except for the encore of the 1985 set) and there are many excellent close-ups of his playing. It's a great look at the rise of one of rock's most revered guitar players.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Sean Westergaard</strong></p>"

It's still a modern blues album, yet it has a wider sonic palette, finding Vaughan fusing a variety of blues, rock, and R&B styles. Most of this is done through covers -- notably Hank Ballard's \"Look at Little Sister,\" the exquisitely jazzy \"Gone Home,\" and Doyle Bramhall's impassioned soul-blues \"Change It\" -- but Vaughan's songwriting occasionally follows suit, as well. Even if only the tortured blues wailer \"Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love\" entered his acknowledged canon, he throws in some delightful soul-funk touches on \"Say What!,\" the instrumental wah-wah workout that kicks off the album, and the Curtis Mayfield-inspired closer, \"Life Without You,\" captures Vaughan at his best as a composer and performer. It's such a seductive number -- such a full realization of his soul-blues ambitions -- that the rest of the album pales in comparison. In fact, for all of its positive attributes, Soul to Soul winds up being less than the sum of its parts, and it's hard to pinpoint an exact reason why. Perhaps it was because Vaughan was on the verge of a horrible battle with substance abuse at the time of recording or perhaps it just has that unevenness inherent in transitional albums. Still, he has good taste in covers, his originals are sturdy, and there's not a bad performance here, so Soul to Soul winds up enjoyable in spite of its flaws, and it clearly points the way to his 1989 masterpiece, In Step.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Stevie Ray Vaughan had always been a phenomenal guitarist, but prior to In Step, his songwriting was hit or miss. Even when he wrote a classic modern blues song, it was firmly within the genre's conventions; only on Soul to Soul's exquisite soul-blues \"Life Without You\" did he attempt to stretch the boundaries of the form. As it turns out, that was the keynote for In Step, an album where Vaughan found his own songwriting voice, blending blues, soul, and rock in unique ways, and writing with startling emotional honesty. Yes, there are a few covers, all well chosen, but the heart of the album rests in the songs he co-wrote with Doyle Bramhall, the man who penned the Soul to Soul highlight \"Change It.\" Bramhall proved to be an ideal collaborator for Vaughan; tunes like the terse \"Tightrope\" and the dense \"Wall of Denial\" feel so intensely personal, it's hard to believe that they weren't the product of just one man. Yet the lighter numbers -- the dynamite boogie \"The House Is Rockin'\" and the breakneck blues of \"Scratch-n-Sniff\" -- are just as effective as songs. Of course, he didn't need words to make effective music: \"Travis Walk\" is a blistering instrumental, complete with intricate fingerpicking reminiscent of the great country guitarist Merle Travis, while the shimmering \"Riviera Paradise\" is every bit as lyrical and lovely as his previous charmer, \"Lenny.\" The magnificent thing about In Step is how it's fully realized, presenting every facet of Vaughan's musical personality, yet it still soars with a sense of discovery. It's a bittersweet triumph, given Vaughan's tragic death a little over a year after its release, yet it's a triumph all the same.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

It's not so much a best-of or career retrospective as a very generous pile of career-spanning material that will genuinely add a new dimension to the Stevie Ray Vaughan listener's library, as fully two-thirds of the 54 tracks were previously unreleased. In addition, of the songs that have been previously available, five of those are cuts on which Vaughan was a sideman or partner (for Johnny Copeland, Albert King, Lonnie Mack, A.C. Reed, and as part of the Vaughan Brothers), so the Vaughan collector might have missed those in the past. Each of the first three discs clock in at more than 75 minutes, progressing from 1977 to 1990 and emphasizing live material, from soundchecks and radio programs to arena-headlining gigs and three solo acoustic tunes (one of which was previously on The Unplugged Collection, Vol. 1) from a 1990 MTV Unplugged episode. As music, though, it's uneven. The earliest and leanest cuts are a valuable supplement to Vaughan's discography, since he didn't have much opportunity to record until the early '80s. Yet sometimes these are too-long shuffles and boogies; his songwriting and singing is not nearly as impressive as his instrumental technique; and his occasional attempts to replicate Jimi Hendrix are inessential. A few familiar popular studio cuts like \"Pride and Joy\" and \"Wall of Denial\" are here, presumably to entertain the more casual Vaughan fans who need an extra push to spring for the box. More rabid Vaughan followers will likely be so overwhelmed by the quantity of unreleased items that they're unlikely to quibble about the presence of tracks they already own. The fourth disc is a DVD with five never-aired and never-issued performances from an episode of the television program Austin City Limits, recorded on October 10, 1989; the 72-page booklet of essays, appreciative quotes from several dozen peers, and more are other bonuses.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>On his first jazz date as a leader since 1992, Czechoslovakian bassist and composer Miroslav Vitous comes out of the gate with a host of heavyweights on one of the more lyrically swinging dates in modern jazz. Vitous' engaged, pulsing, and deeply woody tone is featured in the company of John McLaughlin, Jan Garbarek, Chick Corea, and Jack DeJohnette. While the crystalline sound of Manfred Eicher's ECM is everywhere here, as is the open-ended speculative jazz that the label is renowned -- and ridiculed for -- Vitous offers some startlingly beautiful twists and turns with his ensemble. Vitous, who has been through every music, from jazz-rock fusion as a founding member of Weather Report to being a classical composer, decided to revisit the skeletal remains of his very first session for the label in 1969. Produced by Herbie Mann the disc was, from a musical standpoint, a contentious, utterly brilliant marriage of ideas both old and new. Bandmembers DeJohnette and McLaughlin were present on those sides as well.</p><p>Universal Syncopations is by turns a return to not the old forms, but rather to the manner of illustrating harmonic concepts in a quintet setting that allows for a maximum space between ensemble players while turning notions of swing, counterpoint, and rhythmic invention on their heads. From the wooly, expressionistic \"Tramp Blues,\" with Vitous vamping around the changes, to the wide-open legato guitar phrasing of McLauglin against the double time in Vitous' bass on \"Univoyage,\" to the simmering undulations of Garbarek's saxophones on top of Corea's intricate melodies and right-hand runs on \"Brazilan Waves,\" all of it propelled, not anchored, by the leader's rich tone and accented and punctuated by Garbarek's tight, loping saxophone lines. This is one of those recordings that feels familiar in tone, but is timeless in concept and execution. Universal Syncopations is one of the most gorgeous sounding and toughly played dates of the calendar year.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

		"review": "<p>At this stage of the game, any new Tom Waits record is an event. Listening through the music of his entire career is daunting, to say the least, but it's a journey no one else, with the possible exception of Bob Dylan, has taken before. If one listens to the official recordings, from 1973's Closing Time, featuring the songs of an itinerant Beat barroom singer (no lounges please), right on through to the frenetic mania of 2004's Real Gone, one becomes aware of not only the twists and turns of a songwriter wrestling and bellowing at and with his muse, but of a journeyman artist barely able to hold on to the lid of his creativity, let alone keep it on. True, there have been many stops along the way: in the seediest lounges (1977's Foreign Affairs, which could have been a twisted inspiration to novelist Phillip Kerr when he wrote the Berlin Noir trilogy); acid-drenched blues scree (1980's Heartattack and Vine); travelogues of the unseen and the unspeakable (1985's Rain Dogs); seething and murderous suburban nightmares (1987's Franks Wild Years); the frighteningly comic tales of plagues and carnivals (1993's Black Rider); the scrape, squeal, and hollowed-out metal crunch of urban junkyards and classically American paranoia (1999's Mule Variations); and through-the-mirror-darkly image nightmares and fairy tale variations (2002's Alice and Blood Money). All of it is contained in the man who takes delight in the bent, quarreling marriage of song and sound with dangerously comic imagery.</p><p>Orphans is the most unwieldy Tom Waits collection yet. Packaged in a Cibachrome-tinted box are three discs containing 56 songs total. It claims 30 new tunes, but a mere 14 can be found on other records — six othersd have to be hunted for while the remainder have shown up in various incarnationson soundtracks, compilations, etc. This crazy thing began as a collection of outtakes, rarities, soundtrack tunes, and compilation-only cuts — some of which survive here in new form, including tracks from the Ramblin' Jack Elliot tribute, the Bridge benefit, and two Ramones covers, to name a few. In other words, the first conception for this mess was as a hodgepodge collection of attic material. Waits checked out the tune selection as it was and said something like \"nah, bad idea; this would suck.\" So, he did what any self-respecting artist with a head full of ideas, two stomping, shuffling feet, and itchy fingers — and time on his hands — would do: he recorded new songs and re-recorded others, so the thing would have some kind of elasticity yet hold its rickety bone and far-reaching sources together by means of cheap glue, chewed gum, solder, and a visionary recording engineer named Karl Derfler.</p><p>The end result is this daunting triple disc divided by title and theme: disc one is \"Brawlers,\" Waits' rock and blues record, evoking everyone from T. Rex and Johnny Burnette to Sonny Curtis and Howlin' Wolf. It's a grand thing, since he hasn't released one like this before — the closest were Heartattack and Vine on one side and Mule Variations on the other. Travel, regret, murder, salvation, guttersnipe meditations on sorrow, and nefarious and broken-down innocent — and nefarious — amorous intentions are a few of the themes that run through these tunes like oil and sand. Disc two is \"Bawlers,\" a collection of ballads, raw love songs, weepy wine tunes, wistful yet tentative hope — in the form of floppy prayers — and an under-the-table and wishing, bewildered, yet dead-on topical tome on the world's political situation. Disc three, entitled \"Bastards,\" is even edgier; it's Waits hanging out there with his music and muse on the lunatic fringe of experimentation. Think Bone Machine's wilder moments and Waits' loopy standup comedy in the form of six spoken word pieces included here. Thank goodness he finally did this. If you've ever seen the man on a stage, you'll get why these are so important immediately.<p>\"Brawler\" digs deep into the American roots music that has obsessed Waits since the beginning of his long labyrinthine haul. There's the frenetic rockabilly swagger that probably makes Carl Perkins and Gene Vincent shake and shimmy in their graves. One of the movie tunes, a cover of \"Sea of Love,\" recalls its place in the film for those who've seen it. If you haven't, it's a slanted, tarnished jewel freshly liberated from antiquity. The hobo ballad \"Bottom of the World\" recalls old country gospel, and \"Lucinda\" can only be described as a gallows dance tune. The slippery hoodoo blues \"Road to Peace\" is the season's most timely and topical political song.</p><p>\"Bawlers\" is the set's bridge, and it's easy to see why: it's the most accessible disc in the box. There are some of the movie tunes here, from flicks like Pollock, Big Bad Love, and Shrek 2. Other cuts, such as \"Goodnight Irene,\" recall \"Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)\" from the Small Change album; the singing protagonist here is older and more desperate, almost suicidal. Resignation displaces hope; it's a long reach into the past and expresses the void of the present. The cover of the Ramones' \"Danny Says\" is completely reinvented; it's one of the loneliest, most sweetly desolate of Waits' many sides. It's not all darkness, however; there are gorgeous songs here too, such as \"Never Let Go\" and \"You Can Never Hold Back Spring,\" where an indomitable human spirit reins and rings true.</p><p>Finally, it comes down to \"Bastards.\" The eerie, strange, cabaret-in-a-carnival music that is Weill and Brecht's \"What Keeps Mankind Alive\" enlists banjos, accordion, tuba, and big bass drum as simply the means to let these twisted words out of the box. Thankfully the cover of \"Books of Moses,\" originally by Skip Spence, is here, as is Daniel Johnston's \"King Kong.\" Neither of these cuts resembles their original version, and Waits brings out the dark underbelly inherent in each. \"Bedtime Story\" is the first of the Waits monologues here. It is the repressed wish of every parent (with a sense of humor) to have the temerity to tell this kind of tale to their children when they retire. Others include a reading of Charles Bukowski's \"Nirvana,\" the hilarious monologue \"The Pontiac,\" and the live routine \"Dog Door.\" Perhaps the most inviting cut here is the piano-and-horn ballad \"Altar Boy,\" a postmodern saloon song that would make Bobby Short turn red with rage. This disc is the true mixed bag in the set: unruly, uneven, and full of feints and free-for-alls.</p><p>Ultimately, the epicenter of Orphans is Waits' voice. It's many expressions, nuances, bellows, barks, hollers, open wails, roughshod croons, and midnight whispers carry these songs and monologues to the listener with authority as an open invitation into his sound world, his view of tradition, and his manner of shaping that world as something not ephemeral, but as an extension of musical time itself. As a vocalist, Waits, like Bob Dylan, embodies the entire genealogical line of the blues, jazz, local barroom bards, and traveling minstrels in the very grain of his songs. That wily throat carries not only the songs he and his songwriting partner and wife, Kathleen Brennan, pen, but also the magnet for the sonic atmospheres that frame it. There is adventure, danger, and the sound of the previous, the forgotten, and the wished for in it. And it is that voice that links all three of these discs together and makes them partners. One cannot dismiss that even though some of these songs have appeared elsewhere, Orphans is a major work that goes beyond the origins of the material and drags everything past and present with sound and texture into a present to be presented as something utterly new, beyond anything he has previously issued. To paraphrase Ezra Pound in response to Allen Ginsberg's inquiry about what his poem \"The Cantos\" meant, these orphans speak for themselves.</p><p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>Jerry Jeff Walker was issued on Decca in 1972, and completed his rambling transition from New York folkie to Texas singer/songwriter. He'd left New York a decade earlier, but with all of his running around, he didn't make Austin home until 1971. Everywhere in this record's grooves -- which was recorded in different sessions in both cities -- is the latter's famed good-time, laid-back, take-it-as-it-comes feeling. The organic nature of the sound here is simply because Walker and two different groups (at least) of musicians played the songs live from the studio floor with no soundboard. These first versions of \"Hill Country Rain\" and \"Charlie Dunn\" are virtually peerless. Two Guy Clark tunes (\"That Old Time Feeling\" and \"L.A. Freeway\") rival the songwriter's versions and \"Curly and Lil\" and \"When I Had You\" guarantee the makings of one of the original Texas Music Scene's classics; the music made now that uses that moniker -- from Pat Green's to Cross Canadian Ragweed's -- is merely revisionist history and can be dismissed as such. Walker is at the peak of his powers on this album; it was the first in a string of his records that wouldn't run out, quality-wise, until the end of the decade. He is surrounded by what would become the Lost Gonzo Band (Bob Livingston, Gary P. Nunn, Craig Hillis, and Michael McGreary), with Mary Eagan and Dave Cook adding fiddle and pedal steel, respectively, and with a lively crew of friends (including Mickey Raphael playing harmonica on \"That Old Time Feeling\"). In New York, Walker went to \"mix\" his Texas record with Michael Brovsky, and landed when the Gonzos were playing The Bitter End, prompting more live sessions. In addition to the band, Michael Murphey, David Bromberg, Andy Newmark, Joanne Vent, and Ellen Kearney played on the recordings that cut that part of the album. \"Her Good Lovin' Grace\" (though not the final track) sums up the ambience of these two informal, even revelatory, sessions, as the (Texas) band slips and slides its way through a song in the process of being written as it's recorded. Amazing. Like It's a Good Night for Singin', Ridin' High, and Viva Terlingua, this is a masterpiece, full of terrific songs, fine playing, and a sound that defines the era, yet is timeless.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Viva Terlingua, recorded live in Luckenbach, TX, on a hot August night in 1973, is among the most legendary of \"live\" singer/songwriter albums ever released. It's the Live at the Fillmore East of redneck Texas folk-rock. Essentially, it's Jerry Jeff fronting the Lost Gonzo Band at the beginning of their long run together playing, living it up, having a ball, giving everybody the impression that life was a party, and to be sure, it was for a while. Given the loose, inspired performance on this set, Walker was every bit the equal of Willie, Waylon, and Billy Joe Shaver at the time. The material is terrific. Half of it is from Jerry Jeff's catalog: \"Sangria Wine,\" \"Gettin' By,\" \"Little Bird,\" \"Get It Out,\" and \"Wheel.\" The rest? Can't possibly do better: Guy Clark's \"Desperados Waiting for the Train,\" Ray Wylie Hubbard's \"Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother,\" Michael Murphy's \"Backslider's Wine,\" and Gary P. Nunn's Austin City Limits anthem, \"London Homesick Blues.\" It doesn't sound anything like it was recorded in front of an audience, but it does sound live as hell. These folks were partyin' it up and layin' down the tracks at white heat. This record was made in a night and it feels like it was made in your living room. It's guaranteed to lift any dark mood within 15 minutes. This record asks no questions and there are no hidden meanings in Walker's or anybody else's lyrics; it's all there for the taking. And that's what makes it the enduring classic it is.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

Walker wrote six of the album's ten tracks, the Lost Gonzo Band's Gary P. Nunn wrote two more, Billy Callery wrote one, and David Cohen wrote another. It was all in the family. It's an up-tempo, rockin' country record with \"Salvation Army Band\" kicking everything off; it's followed by a drunken, barely pulled-off \"Will There Be Any\" a cappella. There are the tough outlaw love songs like \"She Left Me Holdin'\" and the long, moving ballad \"My Old Man,\" which follows the wild Dixieland ride of \"I Like to Sleep Late in the Morning.\" There's Gary Nunn fronting the band on a live version of \"Rock Me, Roll Me\" and the brass band feel of \"The First Showboat.\" This is where Stephen Foster meets Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives meets Jerry Jeff's lazy, drawling Texas bass voice on the Mississippi. The album's high point is a ballad, Walker's version \"Well of the Blues\" by Nunn. It's simply arranged: a piano, a bass drum, a brushed snare, Walker's deep voice, and a backing chorus with a B3 easing in the background very slowly and faintly. What can you say? It's another winner.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

He recorded a string of absolutely endearing classics of the outlaw singer/songwriter genre of country music: Viva Terlingua, Walker's Collectibles, Jerry Jeff Walker, It's a Good Night for Singin', the live A Man Must Carry On, and this one, Ridin' High from 1975. Most Walker fans will argue like hell about which is best, but they are interchangeably great and stand the test of time in the same way Guy Clark's and Billy Joe Shaver's albums do. In any case, Ridin' High is pure Texas country drunk & roll with some Nash Vegas players added to the Lost Gonzo Band for some truly Cosmic Cowboy yammering. The material here is top-notch: Willie Nelson's \"Pick Up the Tempo,\" Bob Livingston's \"Public Domain,\" and Guy Clark's \"Like a Coat from the Cold\" -- and they're the first three tracks on the album! Walker has a way of delivering drunken anthems and tender ballads in his deep bass voice that brings you into the song so far you feel as if he's singing it just for you and your friends. He does this consistently on this album, backed by a star cast of players including not only the Gonzos but also Johnny Gimble, David Briggs, Norbert Putnam, and others. And the gorgeous horn touches added by Michael Brovsky are stunning. Two of Walker's own best songs are here, \"I Love You,\" written for his then new wife Susan, and the rowdy man's good-time anthem \"Pissin' in the Wind.\" The album is rounded out by Jesse Winchester's \"Mississippi You're on My Mind,\" Mike Burton's oft-covered nugget \"Night Rider's Lament,\" and a few others. The album feels like a solid stream of hippie cowboy music fed by cold Lone Star, lots of pot, and the occasional line. To listen closely is to miss the point. This is an album to be experienced with the senses, entering into the free flow of Walker's good-time world even for the 40 minutes it takes to listen to the album. But that's far better than nothin', ain't it?</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

On occasion, the performances and songs are a bit too studied to be truly effective, but those moments are fleeting -- <i>Hell Among the Yearlings</i> offers ample proof that Welch is a talented, individual songwriter and that her debut was no fluke.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Owens</b>"

		"review": "<p>Gillian Welch's third album, Time (The Revelator), finds the folk vocalist and musician shifting her attention from achingly beautiful mountain ballads to achingly beautiful pop/rock ballads. Regarding this album, Welch states: \"As opposed to being little tiny folk songs or traditional songs, they're really tiny rock songs. They're just performed in this acoustic setting. In our heads we went electric without changing instruments.\" This philosophy is most evident in songs like \"I Want to Sing That Rock and Roll\" and \"Elvis Presley Blues,\" with her longtime collaborator David Rawlings accompanying her on Louvin-esque high harmonies and vintage guitar. Fans of the duo's neo-old-timey sound will be happy to hear a few of their familiar, intimate dust bowl folk songs peering through the fence posts.</p><p>The banjo-driven \"My First Lover\" could've been recorded on Alan Lomax's back porch, while the title track aches and moans along with the best of her two previous albums. Rawlings' production on the album remains warm and intimate throughout, capturing the subtleties of the acoustic instruments and earthy harmonies. Highlights include the passionate romp \"Red Clay Halo,\" which includes the best elements of time-honored folk stylings and their newfound passion for rock & roll, and the hushed awe that captures the audience in the Ryman Auditorium during the live recording of \"I Want to Sing That Rock and Roll.\" <i>Time (The Revelator)</i> ends with an unprecedented 15-minute track called \"I Dream a Highway,\" which drifts lazily through the album's final moments, sweetly dozing in the current like Huck and Jim's Mississippi River afternoons. Welch and Rawlings are at the top of their form and continue to make the best Americana recordings without resorting to drenching their albums in guest stars, but by writing and performing heartfelt songs that speak with a clear and undeniable honesty.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Zac Johnson</strong></p><hr/><p>Although his hardcore Compton posturing may have led you to believe otherwise,     Tracy Morrow (aka Ice T) was not raised in a Los Angeles ghetto. The Original     Gangsta was actually born in another O.G.-- the Original Garden State, New Jersey.     But no matter his roots, T had gangsta in his goddamn blood.  After his parents     died, T realized his ice-cold destiny, determined to move to South Central and     adopt the gangsta lifestyle. And adopt it he did, rising above his critics to rap     convincingly about killing people, selling addictive drugs, and enjoying the     copious bounty of many large black asses.          Luckily for Gillian Welch, the path to acclaim in the folk-country genre doesn't     require moving to Oklahoma, Appalachia, or a Mississippi riverbank. Nor does it     call for songs about killing people, peddling crack, or mining for black ass-gold     (in fact, the latter is probably anathema to the cause). Rather, it's just fine if     you sound like you know what you're doing and appreciate tradition, and Welch     achieves that with ease.          Gillian Welch's third LP, Time (The Revelator) is ample proof. Despite being     born and raised in Los Angeles, the child of a husband and wife songwriting duo     who scored the theme to \"The Carol Burnett Show,\" Welch has managed to create some     refreshingly charming, rustic folk-country music that bears the mark of a culture     buried in the Blue Ridge, 3000 miles removed from her home. That she's only 33     makes her feat of authenticity even more remarkable.          Welch's selling-point are her plaintive vocals, as tender as they are weathered.     Her voice is, in and of itself, a stereotype of the South: genteel, soulful and     honest. Even with seemingly frivolous lyrics like on \"Elvis Presley Blues,\"     Welch's voice expresses depth, coloring the song with experienced, time-warped     romanticism.          Accompanying Welch on vocals is a soft palette of acoustic instrumentation.     Although the songs carry a greater pop influence than her prior releases, the     sound is still unmistakably country. Strummed or fingerpicked acoustic guitar     occupies the foreground on most tracks, with the occasional twang of a banjo, as     on the bluesy \"My First Lover.\"  Adding to the spacious character of the     orchestration is the album's absence of percussion. The result is plenty of room     for melodies, with the focus squarely on Welch's voice. Time (The Revelator) wavers from heartbroken lament (\"Revelator,\"     \"Everything Is Free\") to Southern nostalgia (\"I Want to Sing that Rock n' Roll,\"     \"Red Clay Halo\") but not once does it stray from Welch's reflective, reserved     storyteller's demeanor. The vocals and lyrics alike are open and vulnerable. More     than simply an expression of her music, Time (The Revelator) is a glimpse     into the artist's personality.          Those without the heritage need to work to attain their destiny. For Ice-T, it     meant moving to Compton, living the life of a hustler, and filming cinematic     masterpieces like Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo and Frankenpenis.     For Gillian Welch, it meant studying at Berklee School of Music and listening to     old Delmore Brothers and Carter Family recordings. Whatever her path, though, her     results are as good as the original.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Brad Haywood, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

REESE: Being here shouldn't unnerve you any more than I'm freaked out by Foot Locker, or Colonel Rapehawk's     Burrito Sports Satellite Steakhouse.     ASH: These places brim with so many contradictions.  The clientele range from pragmatic activists to     tarot-addled goons, so the merchandise fittingly runs the gamut from useful political analyses to     superstitious hokum.  And why are Gillian Welch CDs always playing?     REESE: Be charitable, patriarch.  Welch fascinatingly embodies modern feminism's slipperiness.  She should     be a cliché within a cliché wrapped in a cliché with a side of clichéradish sauce, especially under the     weight of those \"Southern,\" range-roaming, country-road tropes.  But her albums are weirdly fresh and     weirdly, er, cool.     ASH: Especially this new album with its occasional-- and radical, for Welch-- \"full band\" approach     (featuring contributors to albums by rural postureminders such as Beck and Son Volt).     REESE: Did you just speak in a parenthetical?  Or am I inside your mind?     ASH: Alls I'm saying is that points on this album have much more to do with the sparse, dolorous pop of     Aimee Mann than they do with countresses like Emmylou Harris.     REESE: Hey wait, Emmylou Harris covered Gillian Welch.     ASH: Exactly my point. Harris is known as an expert arranger, while Mann and Welch are songwriters,     even though-- ahem-- they compose with male partners.  Besides, Harris covered Welch's most popular tune,     \"Orphan Girl\", which every self-dramatizing spaghetti-strapper over-lip-syncs in her Honda Civic.     REESE: I love that song.     ASH: The song is, like, the hokey pokey of familial absentia.  \"I have no mother, no father, no sister, no     brother/ I am an orphan girl\"?  I'm gonna write one called \"Multiple Amputee\" that goes \"I have no arms,     no legs...\"     REESE: Metallica already did that.  If you weren't stupid, you'd see that \"Orphan Girl\" is a formal     eschewing of the matriarchal burdens associated with rural womanhood, just as the speaker on this album's     \"Wrecking Ball\" appropriates the \"rolling stone\" stance usually romanticized by men.  You know, I can't     help but notice that your own Southern-tropist swoon-tune gets covered here: wasn't \"I Had a Real Good     Mother and Father\" popularized by Bonnie \"Prince\" Oldham back in his days as a Palace sibling?     ASH: What a tune. [ASH blushes and fingers his lip.] While we're dishing out penis-points, let's give some     credit to the sweetly rendered song associated with Mississippi John Hurt, \"Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor\".     Also note that the arrangement owes a dollar or two to the first disc of Dylan's \"bootleg\" threefer.     Meanwhile, your precious \"Wrecking Ball\" is just an outtake from Jason Molina's Magnolia Electric     Co. with fiddle overdubs.     REESE: Hmph.  I see what you mean about the crossroads of seriousness and blarney, though.  How can an     album so reticent and measured bear a moniker as new-agey as Soul Journey?  That reeks of Shirley     MacLaine and that star-chart-fondling crystal-culture.     ASH: A shame, because the songs are so no-nonsense, trafficking in classic idioms (riding with the \"top     down\" is libertine, etc) and landscape metaphors (\"lowlands\" and \"black highways\" mean trouble, etc).     Except for \"One Monkey\"?  What the hell?  \"One monkey don't stop the show\"?     REESE: Is it about not being distracted from the big picture by an insulting fad, such as a Nashville     whorelet or a dopey politico?  Is its punishing repetition purposeful, or a cave-in to Tracy Chapmanship?     Maybe it's borrowing the language of pre-Civil Rights-era America, saying something about one uppity Negro     not being a threat to the status quo?  That explanation would offset some of the cultural baggage that this     \"throwback\" music totes around.     ASH: I don't know.  This album's most \"bluegrass\" song (\"No One Knows My Name\") is just a refashioning of     \"She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes\".  Seems pretty harmless.     REESE: Hey, look, this store sells those bumper stickers that say THE BANJO IS AN AFRICAN INSTRUMENT!  Maybe     I could include Welch in my doctoral thesis on Anglosimilitude.  It would fit with my bachelor's thesis,     King Kut: Castration Metaphors in Old-School Rap and my master's thesis I Am the Eighteenth Pale     Descendant: Steven Patrick Morrissey and Whiteness as an Othering Force.     ASH: I wish I were a turntablist. \"One Monkey\" would make a mean mash-up with Whodini's \"The Freaks Come     Out at Night\".     REESE: Ugh. That kind of futurism, which debases art's factory-sealedness, is why I want to take refuge in     pastoral works such as Soul Journey.  Lightning Bolt makes me feel seventy years old and addicted to     painkillers and marathons of Diagnosis: Murder.     ASH: Fair enough. Welch is definitely the most relevant of the O Brother Pluck Art Thou gang of     neo-yodelers.  And I reckon that if you find the bleats-n-beats of The Rapture soulless, then you might     love this soft, warm, but still interestingly distant work.  Then again, Soul Journey remains a     tad raptureless.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Bowers, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Eventually the dispute was resolved, and 2002 saw the release of the deluxe edition of this classic album, expanded into a two-CD work with the addition of no less than 17 extra tracks. So is it time to celebrate and finally throw away that scratchy old <em>My Generation</em> LP, whichever version of that you have? Unfortunately, not quite. Pluses first: The sound, remixed in stereo by Talmy, is very good indeed, very clear and punchy without sacrificing the enormous power the band brought to the sessions, sometimes revealing parts with a clarity never before heard. This also, finally, adds some seminal non-LP tracks also recorded in 1965 (most notably their debut single, \"I Can't Explain\"), as well as a bunch of R&amp;B cover outtakes that previously surfaced on the 1980s comps <em>Who's Missing</em> and <em>Two's Missing</em>.</p><p>There are also slightly longer versions of a few tracks; an instrumental track for \"My Generation\" and an \"a cappella version\" of \"Anytime You Want Me\"; and one genuine previously unheard song, \"Instant Party Mixture,\" a weird and not good takeoff on Dion's \"Runaround Sue\" that was recorded in early 1966 as a possible B-side. So what's to carp about? Well, some overdubs used in the original version of the LP have been lost, and their loss is not just something that audiophiles or unhealthily completist record collectors will notice. Specifically, on \"My Generation,\" Pete Townshend's guitar is virtually missing from the instrumental break, and the group's backup vocals at the song's climax are likewise mostly missing. Other little omissions crop up too, and though this compilation makes up for that a bit with \"monaural versions with guitar overdubs\" of \"My Generation\" and \"A Legal Matter,\" it's no small loss. Also, unbelievably, although \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" is here (and misspelled on the cover), it's an alternate version with different vocals from a French EP. It's fine to include that, but the classic single version itself, a tremendously exciting and important record, isn't present at all, and no one could reasonably claim there shouldn't have been room for both. Too, the version of \"Leaving Here\" is an alternate, and while that's fine to have as a marginally interesting addition, the version that first showed up on <em>Who's Missing</em> is, um, missing.</p><p>These shortcomings are not unimportant. If a group and label are going to bill something as the ultimate package of classic album-plus-bonus tracks, it should have everything you want to hear. This deluxe edition doesn't. This doesn't, of course, mean that it doesn't contain much great music, particularly the <em>My Generation</em> album itself, a <em>tour de force</em> of British mod music maturing from R&amp;B rave-ups into melodic power pop with riveting instrumental and lyrical hooks. It is also good to hear the nice early R&amp;B cover B-sides \"Daddy Rolling Stone\" and \"Anytime You Want Me,\" and while the R&amp;B-oriented outtakes of Motown songs like \"(Love Is  Like A) Heat Wave\" aren't so good, as historical documentation they're important. The sessions are also documented nicely in a booklet of liner notes. But no doubt we'll have to wait for the SACD or DVD or some such configuration to correct some of these flaws and separate us from more of our hard-earned cash.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Richie Unterberger</strong></p><hr/><p>The Who got bigger, brainier, better and generally tougher as they grew. But they were never as fiercely raw as they were on their first album, My Generation. In 36 minutes, they tore through the conventions of British rock 'n' roll until they found a place they could call their own. Five decades after its release, the album stands as one of rock music's greatest debuts.</p><p>For its 50th anniversary, My Generation has been expanded to a five-CD Super Deluxe Edition that adds new mixes, B-sides, singles, alternate takes and demos. And over the course of more than 75 tracks, the set sketches out a template the Who would build from and break down several times during their career, pulling in everything from R&B rave-ups and chiming pop to scorching rock 'n' roll and proto-punk anarchy.</p><p>While much of this material has surfaced on other collections, including previous anniversary editions of My Generation, the set attempts to wrangle most of the period's songs into one place. A few strays from earlier editions, mostly different alternate versions, are missing, but the Super Deluxe Edition is the most representative collection of a pivotal year in the life of the Who, starting with the \"I Can't Explain\" single from early 1965.</p><p>The center of it all is the My Generation LP, included here in a newly remastered mono mix and a stereo mix of the album from 2014 that was previously available only on iTunes. Both versions heighten the guitars and pulsing rhythm section that drive songs like \"The Kids Are Alright,\" \"A Legal Matter\" and the classic title tune. The bonus tracks here -- shuffled between mono and stereo mixes, and including some of the singles and B-sides released before and after the album came out -- serve as jagged bookends to the LP's dozen tracks.</p><p>It's a vivid portrait of the Who's first several months as professional recording artists. All these years later, the explosive clash of garage-rock R&B and serrated pop from this period that later helped form their identity sounds like a launching point of things to come -- from Roger Daltrey's throaty vocals to Pete Townshend's whipping guitar attacks to that thing Keith Moon did on the drums where he was never quite on the beat but powered the rhythm all the same.</p><p>The weakest disc here, the one dedicated to almost a dozen Townshend demos from the era, provide the sketches (and, in one case, just a fragment) for the full-band takes. They're interesting as starting points, but they don't approach the force of the released versions. (Three of the songs are brand new to Who fans; Townshend discovered the stashed-away demo tapes in 2015.)</p><p>And that's why My Generation matters the most. As the band grew and got more popular, Townshend took control as its chief songwriter and architect. This Super Deluxe Edition of the Who's debut is all about the band -- before the rock operas, fringe jackets and trashed hotels -- in all of its raging glory.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Michael Gallucci</strong></p>"

With the expansion to a two-CD format, much of the previously edited material has been reinstated to reflect the actual pacing of the show more accurately. This new mix — supervised by Pete Townshend (guitar/vocal) — is an all-encompassing stereoscape which has never felt more intimidating. Although no mention is made in the information- and memorabilia-laden 28-page liner-notes booklet, vocalist Roger Daltrey performed several vocal overdubs during <I>Tommy</I> which are unique to this release.

		"review": "<P>The Who's catalog was revamped in the mid-'90s, with every title (except My Generation, due to legal entanglements with producer Shel Talmy) receiving new remastering and bonus tracks. Nearly eight years later, Who's Next, one of the group's most beloved albums, was given another remastered/expanded treatment as part of Universal Chronicles' Deluxe Edition series. Now it spans two discs, including a full disc devoted to their legendary show at the Young Vic on April 26, 1971. Reportedly, this is also the first time the original master tapes were used for a CD master as well, and while the difference isn't as dramatically different as it was from the 1984 CD to the 1995 CD, this is a richer, resonant mix, which may be reason enough for some fans to acquire it. Most collectors will focus on the bonus material, all of which ranges from very good to great, yet the set on the whole gets a qualified recommendation for one very simple reason: The greatest of the material here was already featured as bonus material on the 1995 reissue. True, some of the versions were present as single edits, but the greatest songs — \"Pure and Easy,\" a rollicking cover of \"Baby Don't You Do It,\" the live set pieces \"Naked Eye\" and \"Water,\" \"Too Much of Anything,\" \"I Don't Even Know Myself,\" the original take of \"Behind Blue Eyes\" — were all bonus tracks on the previous edition (this is not counting the fact that the electric version of \"Love Ain't for Keepin',\" which is really good, is also on Odds &amp; Sods). That said, there is some unreleased music here that is either fascinating (the first take of \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" which sounds as if it's on the verge of collapse) or excellent (the whole of the Young Vic show, where you can hear the band get its strength back; it's a truly fine concert). But no matter how good, or even revelatory, some of this is, the end result feels underwhelming because any Who fan has heard the most crucial music here before (and those who enjoy nitpicking will surely wonder why there wasn't more of an effort to present Lifehouse rejects and outtakes here instead of a full concert). If you're a fan, Who's Next: The Deluxe Edition is like paying a bill — buying it is something that needs to be done, you're glad once it's done, but it's not something you're necessarily eager to do. — <B>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</B> <P>&nbsp;</P><P>Few albums in the pantheon of classic rock recordings embody the greatness of an artist more than 1971's Who's Next. Arguably the Who's finest effort, the album came at a time when the group was at its creative peak. Fresh off the monumental success of the rock opera Tommy in 1969, the band had ridden a wave of critical acclaim for the album and subsequent live performances of its material, highlighted by memorable gigs at the Metropolitan Opera House, Woodstock, and the Isle of Wight. The scope of Tommy had drawn attention to Pete Townshend's emerging genius as a songwriter, and in the process set a standard that he would be measured by throughout the Who's illustrious career. The viability of Tommy as a recorded and live vehicle had given Townshend renewed confidence in his own abilities, and had motivated him to take on larger challenges. His primary focus post Tommy came in the form of the Lifehouse project, a grandiose look at the possibilities of music in a futuristic setting. Townshend's idealized views on rock and roll as an element of one's being, laid the groundwork for an elaborately sophisticated creation consisting of a feature film, expansive album, and interactive live concerts. While plausible to Townshend, the intricate blueprint for musical salvation proved to be a logistical impossibility, and the project gradually unraveled into disarray. In spite of its failure to reach fruition, the Lifehouse project yielded enough quality recorded material to assemble the nine-song album Who's Next. At the time, no one could have foreseen the magnitude of this release, particularly Townshend himself who had viewed it as a commercial compromise of his Lifehouse vision.</P><P>Despite Townshend's initial misgivings, the magnitude of Who's Next is undeniable. The scope of its grandeur is evidenced by every track having become an FM radio staple, with much of the album's material incorporated into the Who's long standing concert set list. While each song is memorable in its own right, most notable are \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", which has reached rock anthem status, and the John Entwistle penned \"My Wife\" that proudly displays the bassist's skills as a songwriter. Simply put, it is as close to perfect an album as could be imagined. How then could a recording of this stature be improved upon? Read on. </P><P>MCA has given Who aficionados an early Christmas present with the release of Who's Next Deluxe Edition. The original album has been coupled with added songs, and a complete second disc has been included featuring a live Lifehouse performance at London's Young Vic Theater. Altogether, the twin CD set provides twenty-nine tracks totaling two and a half hours of vintage Who material. Additionally, an updated Townshend essay describing the Lifehouse project is featured, as well as extensive liner notes that shed light on the history of the album's recording processes.</P><P>Disc 1 is comprised of 15 tracks; Who's Next in its entirety, and six newly remastered recordings from early studio sessions that did not make the final album cut. Alternate versions of \"Getting in Tune\", \"Love Ain't for Keeping\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\" give listeners slightly different looks at the material, while the original recorded version of \"Pure and Easy\" showcases the song's melodic beauty. The inclusion of an extended Motown cover of \"Baby Don't You Do It\" harkens back to the group's early club days and provides an interesting counterbalance to the album's more readily recognized tracks. The most fascinating of the additional material comes by way of a previously unreleased alternate version of \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". This take utilizes a different synthesizer track than the traditional version and is missing Daltrey's trademark scream. Overall, the six additional listings supply a welcome compliment to the album's original nine songs.</P><P>Disc 2 offers remixed versions of fourteen songs performed at the Young Vic during the Spring of 1971. Taking place at roughly the same time as gigs at Leeds and the Isle of Wight, this Lifehouse concert maintains the distinctive live sound from the period, and includes much of the same material from those shows. It also provides evidence of the Who's ability to flawlessly transition brilliant studio material to the stage. Featured tracks from Who's Next include \"Love Ain't for Keeping\", \"Behind Blue Eyes\", \"Getting in Tune\", \"Bargain\", and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". Fiery covers of \"Young Man Blues\" and \"Road Runner\" are included in the set, as are somewhat lesser played, but no less potent renditions of \"Pure and Easy\", \"I Don't Even Know Myself\", \"Too Much of Anything\", and \"Time Is Passing\". Also in the set is an outstanding trio of concert mainstays \"Water\", \"My Generation\", and \"Naked Eye\". Throughout the performance, Daltrey's vocals are strong and gritty, Moon's drumming is sharp, Entwistle lays down his usual virtuoso thunder, and Townshend's guitar playing is flawless.</P><P>The Deluxe Edition of Who's Next is noteworthy for two reasons. First, in an age of rampant re-releases and often sub par offerings, MCA has deviated from the curve and put together an exemplary package of material for Who fans. The sound quality on both CD's is excellent, while the booklet included is informative and enlightening. Second, the creative dynamic that went into the aborted Lifehouse project can be more fully appreciated as a greater amount of original material is made available. Townshend's musical vision may have been ahead of its time, but three decades later his songs still resonate with power and passion. For the most part, Who's Next rose like a Phoenix from the ashes of Lifehouse, catching lightning in a bottle as the group was at its pinnacle of greatness. Now, the album returns to much of its original conceptualized splendor, making it even better.</P>"

Released in 1996, My Generation: The Very Best of the Who was intended to be the definitive single-disc collection, replacing all the others that preceded it. While it is a very good collection, it just misses being a definitive sampler. Essentially, My Generation is a replica of Who's Better, Who's Best that adds four tracks that were missing from the previous compilation, including the seminal post-Tommy single \"The Seeker\" and the original single mix of \"Magic Bus.\" My Generation isn't strictly a singles collection, since it contains such album rock staples as \"Baba O'Riley\" and the full-length version of \"Won't Get Fooled Again.\" It also spans the group's entire career, so it has a bit of a scattershot feel to it -- \"You Better You Bet\" sounds a little odd next to tense early singles like \"Substitute\" and \"I Can See for Miles.\" The career-spanning approach doesn't make for as cohesive a collection as Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, but it does mean that My Generation is an excellent -- even necessary -- introduction. There's a lot more in the Who's catalog that needs to be heard, but My Generation does boil down the most essential items (even though the abominable \"Squeeze Box\" is included) to a fine single-disc set.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

Snappily titled The Who Hits 50!, by virtue of spanning two full CDs the set does cast a wider net than either Greatest Hits or 2004's Then & Now, beginning with the stiff R&B of the High Numbers' \"Zoot Suit\" and concluding with the brand-new \"Be Lucky,\" a delirious revival of Pete Townshend's purple, overwritten '80s midlife crisis. In between those two songs come 40 tracks, including some genuine surprises -- the bonkers mod anthem \"Dogs\" and its Beach Boys-aping flip \"Call Me Lightning,\" the band's cover of the Stones' \"The Last Time,\" the first appearance of \"Relay\" in a comp in ages, John Entwistle's paranoid \"Trick of the Light\" -- but for the most part, this serves up the same songs that have popped up again and again on Who compilations over the years.

		"review": "<p>Myth, it has been said, is the buried part of every story. On     April 23rd, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot finally emerges into     the light of day, having spent the last year interred in its     own cluttered mythology: a hermetic studio gestation, with the     inscrutable guidance of Chicago ex-pat/kindly wizard, Jim     O'Rourke; internecine squabbles; conflict and resolution with     American media behemoth AOL Time Warner; the release portentously     slated for September 11th, but mysteriously delayed; the     indecipherable short-wave radio prophecies; and, eventually,     the hero's welcome, with the first stirrings of spring. It's all     there: the miracle birth; the unlikely hero; the, um, benevolent     mentor; the primordial menace; good over evil. Joseph Campbell     would be pissing himself if he weren't dead.          The miraculous birth narrative of Wilco's fourth album, Yankee     Hotel Foxtrot, is already old hat: banished from straightedge     AOL Time Warner imprint Reprise on the cosmically short-sighted     judgment of label executives who deemed the album a \"career-ender,\"     Wilco streamed Yankee Hotel from its left-wing website to     millions before signing with weirdo progressive AOL Time Warner     imprint Nonesuch. Long is the way and hard that leads up from     AOL Time Warner into the light, I guess.          But the unique circumstances of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's     long deliverance make for more than just pointless disc jockey     chatter before spinning \"Heavy Metal Drummer.\"  The long delay     and streaming audio conspired to ensure that everyone in the     world has already heard Yankee Hotel Foxtrot in part,     if not in its entirety. Vast digital pre-circulation, corporate     controversy, and buzz like a beard of bees have rendered all     reviews afterthoughts at best.          But myth is always an afterthought, and these days, the motif I     like chewing on best is, without question, that of the Unlikely     Hero. Who would have predicted an album of this magnitude from     Wilco? As much I love the band, the fact remains that they were     together for five years before they produced anything that could     stand with Uncle Tupelo's March 16-20, 1992 or Anodyne.     AM is rather forgettable, while the expansive Being     There, though frequently inspired, travels on paths blazed     by Tom Petty on Damn the Torpedoes, if not The Flying     Burrito Brothers.          1999's dolorous Summerteeth was exponentially more     sophisticated than anything that came before it, though its     heroin innuendoes, shades of domestic abuse and nocturnal     homicidal impulses sat somewhat ill at ease alongside the     album's lush and infectious pop arrangements. Of course,     Summerteeth was a strange and majestic, albeit dark,     deviation from the alt-country genre Jeff Tweedy co-invented.     But since Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, it has retroactively     become more of a harbinger of things to come. Upon being pressed     by the Chicago Sun-Times about abandoning alt-country,     Tweedy dismissively bequeathed the old Wilco sound to Ryan     Adams.  And you can never go home again.          So does Yankee Hotel Foxtrot justify the controversy,     delay and buzz?  Everyone, I think, already knows that the     answer is yes; all I can offer is \"me too\" and reiterate. And     after half a year living with a bootleg copy, the music remains     revelatory. Complex and dangerously catchy, lyrically     sophisticated and provocative, noisy and somehow serene,     Wilco's aging new album is simply a masterpiece; it is equally     magnificent in headphones, cars and parties. And as anyone who's     seen the mixed-bag crowd at Wilco shows knows, it will find a     home in the collections of hippies, frat boys, acid-eating prep     schoolers, and the record store apparatchiks of the indiocracy.     No one is too good for this album; it is better than all of us.          But for all the talk of terminally hip influences-- Jim O'Rourke,     krautrock, and The Conet Project-- Yankee Hotel Foxtrot     still conjures a classic rock radio station on Fourth of July     weekend. And this extends beyond the alternating Byrds/Stones/Beatles     comparisons that pepper every Wilco review ever written; Yankee     Hotel Foxtrot evokes Steely Dan, the Eagles, Wings, Derek &     The Dominos and Traffic. The slightly disconnected, piano-led     \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\" is delicately laced with     noise, whistles and percussive clutter, like some great grandson     of \"A Day in the Life.\" The muted, \"Kamera\" strums along darkly     with acoustic and electric guitars; the twittering electronics     in the background don't quite mitigate the tune's comparability     to the clever and precise (though now largely neglected)     jazz-inflected blues-rock of Dire Straits' stunning debut.          The cone-filtered and anthemic country psychedelia of \"War on     War\" could have been jammed straight out of a hot \"Bertha\" at a 1973     Grateful Dead show. The violin and coked-up country lounge of     \"Jesus, etc.\" recalls some mythical seventies in true love and     cigarettes. The sharp, stuttering guitar solo that rips open     \"I'm the Man Who Loves You\" could have come directly out of     Neil Young's hollow body electric circa Everybody Knows This     Is Nowhere. For all its aural depth and layering, Yankee     Hotel tends to come off as earnest as yesteryear's FM radio.     Wilco gets the benefit of O'Rourke's gift for cutting straight     to the guts of every style, without the burden of his trademark     contempt for the subject matter at hand.          And Tweedy seems to be coming into his own as a lyricist. I     still wince when I hear him sing, \"I know you don't talk much     but you're such a good talker,\" on Being There. The     brooding introspection of Summerteeth made for a handful     of elegant lyrics, most notably the skeletal beauty of \"She's a     Jar,\" where \"she begs me not to miss her\" returns as the stinging     \"she begs me not to hit her,\" transforming a wistful love song     into something gently bruising. But on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,     Tweedy becomes what I think he always was: an optimist and a     romantic.          His declaration of wanting to salute \"the ashes of American     flags,\" is less cynicism than, perhaps, the devoted liberal's     nostalgia for an honest patriotism (check out the array of     properly lefty links at wilcoworld.com if you don't believe     me).  \"All my lies are always wishes,\" he sings, \"I know I     would die if I could come back new.\"  In \"Jesus, etc.,\" there's     a cascading simplicity when he sings, \"Tall buildings shake,     voices escape, singing sad, sad songs to two chords/ Strung     down your cheeks, bitter melodies turning your orbit around.\"     Sad, celestial and lovely.  The final declaration on Yankee     Hotel Foxtrot is one of abiding dedication: \"I've got     reservations 'bout so many things but not about you.\" There     isn't a truer word to be had.          On Summerteeth, Tweedy yowled about \"speakers speaking     in code\" and I thought of that refrain from \"I Can't Stand It\"     when I first heard the words \"yankee-hotel-foxtrot\" uttered by     the disembodied English woman on the sublimely creepy box-set     of shortwave radio transmissions, The Conet Project, which     is sampled sporadically throughout this record.  And in a     deeper, more deliberate world, perhaps we could trace that     thread to unravel the secret wonder of Wilco's new album. But     I don't think there's any secret; and I don't think there's any     code. Beneath the great story of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,     there are all the tropes and symbols and coincidences of a     little mythology; but under that is a fantastic rock record.     And why tell you? You all already knew this.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Brent S. Sirota, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>It isn't surprising that Lucinda Williams' level of craft takes time to assemble, but the six-year wait between Sweet Old World and its 1998 follow-up, <b>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</b>, still raised eyebrows. The delay stemmed both from label difficulties and Williams' meticulous perfectionism, the latter reportedly over a too-produced sound and her own vocals. Listening to the record, one can understand why both might have concerned Williams. Car Wheels is far and away her most produced album to date, which is something of a mixed blessing. Its surfaces are clean and contemporary, with something in the timbres of the instruments (especially the drums) sounding extremely typical of a late-'90s major-label roots-rock album. While that might subtly alter the timeless qualities of Williams' writing, there's also no denying that her sound is punchier and livelier. The production also throws Williams' idiosyncratic voice into sharp relief, to the point where it's noticeably separate from the band. As a result, every inflection and slight tonal alteration is captured, and it would hardly be surprising if Williams did obsess over those small details. But whether or not you miss the earthiness of Car Wheels' predecessors, it's ultimately the material that matters, and Williams' songwriting is as captivating as ever. Intentionally or not, the album's common thread seems to be its strongly grounded sense of place -- specifically, the Deep South, conveyed through images and numerous references to specific towns. Many songs are set, in some way, in the middle or aftermath of not-quite-resolved love affairs, as Williams meditates on the complexities of human passion. Even her simplest songs have more going on under the surface than their poetic structures might indicate. In the end, <b>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</b> is Williams' third straight winner; although she might not be the most prolific songwriter of the '90s, she's certainly one of the most brilliant.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Steve Huey</strong></p><hr/><p>When nothing but time can still the pain, a Lucinda Williams song will see you through. In her dry Louisiana drawl, she sings plaintively of abusive childhoods and bad marriages; of drunken bar brawls and suicidal poets; of her own heart that shatters and mends and shatters again, like a puzzle, down-and-out. A magnet for the kind of unrequited love that seems to stop the Earth from turning, Williams persists. Then she's onto the next town.</p><p>Williams was born a rolling stone. Her late father, the poet Miller Williams, was a college professor and the family moved often, to Mexico and Chile and a dozen Southern towns. After Williams was expelled from one New Orleans high school in part for refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in protest of Vietnam, dad gave her a list of 100 great books to read instead. (Williams' family of civil rights activists and union workers passed on that spirit of dissent as well.) Miller's profession brought a young Lucinda into contact with Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, and, most influentially, Flannery O'Connor. Williams would never let go of her O'Connor-inspired fantasy of writing a Great Southern Novel. Instead, Williams set hers to music, becoming an itinerant Southern Gothic beat.</p><p>At 18, she left home and belonged nowhere. There was no alternative country in 1974, no alternative rock, no Americana, and in at least one Austin bar where Williams hoped to perform, no room for another \"chick singer.\" Nashville told her she was too rock'n'roll. Los Angeles said she was too country. Galvanized by Bob Dylan, Williams' songwriting evoked his poetic ambition, Bruce Springsteen's every-people, Joni Mitchell's confessionalism. The lonesomeness of jukebox country met the darkness of an outlaw. The whiskey-stained tenacity of the blues was spiked with the honey of AM pop. She released two albums, a 1979 covers collection Ramblin and 1980's thrilling Happy Woman Blues, but did not catch a break until a punk label, Rough Trade, came along and signed her (making her labelmates with Stiff Little Fingers, on the one hand; Leadbelly, on the other). Lucinda Williams, in 1988, was her third album and first masterpiece. Ten years later, Car Wheels on a Gravel Road was her second.</p><p>Williams was by then 45 and over two decades into her career at the fringes: touring small clubs, working with small labels, the life of an '80s indie band more than a country star. She had released only four albums, filled with female characters who wanted it all&mdash;sung by a woman who wanted it all, too. The cool girls in Lucinda Williams songs were always packing up, pawning possessions, saving their tips to split town. There was \"Maria,\" in 1980, who was \"wild and restless\" and \"born to roam.\" There was the small-town waitress Sylvia, in 1988's \"The Night's Too Long,\" who resolutely declares \"I'm moving away/I'm gonna get what I want.\" \"One Night Stand\" was like a long-lost string-band ancestor of Liz Phair's \"Fuck and Run.\" These were mini-manifestos for a female life. Williams' feminism rang with no stronger conviction than when she used the first-person to narrate her own desires: \"Give me what I deserve cause it's my right!\" she longed on her eventual hit, \"Passionate Kisses.\"</p><p>If what she wanted was recognition, or fulfillment, or money&mdash;with Car Wheels, she got it. But the road there was almost comically difficult. Labels combusted in her wake: Rough Trade, Chameleon, and American all fell apart after she signed. RCA head Bob Buziak brought her to that label and then got fired. Williams and the music industry seemed allergic to one another. Lucinda Williams was an astonishing album&mdash;a classic from a renegade songwriter who never grew too hardened to admit \"I just wanted to see you so bad\"&mdash;but you couldn't blame the greater public for being somewhat oblivious to it, since Rough Trade went bankrupt shortly after its release. Better-known fans kept the songs alive, with covers from the likes of Tom Petty, Patty Loveless, and Mary Chapin Carpenter. In 1997 the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"It's a good thing Williams has gotten a boost from others, because her own luck as a recording artist has been miserable.\"</p><p>The six-year gap between 1992's Sweet Old World and Car Wheels is now charged with myth. By one account, Car Wheels took six tedious years, recorded three times in three cities with three different producers. In reality, there were two years in the studio, from 1995 to 1997, and one scrapped attempt. After Williams started the album with her longtime guitarist and co-producer Gurf Morlix, she felt it was \"flat, lifeless, not up to par\" and chose to re-record with country fixture Steve Earle and his production partner, Ray Kennedy. She liked their warm, scratchy old equipment and how prominently Kennedy had produced the vocals on Earle's 1996 album, I Feel Alright. When time ran out, Williams finished the album in L.A. with Roy Bittan, a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, adding keyboards, accordions, guitar, and backing vocals. (Though Bittan claimed, \"We redid most everything.\") A tornado hit Nashville just as Williams was mastering the finished analog tapes; someone had to race to the studio to save them.</p><p>Unlike her hero, Dylan, Williams was mapping directions home. But home, never fixed to one place, was a profound in-between, more like the breeze that pushed her. Car Wheels is a raw, exquisite travelogue of her American South, from Jackson to Vicksburg, from West Memphis to Slidell, from the Louisiana Highway to Lake Pontchartrain. She searched for novelistic detail in back roads and cotton fields and dilapidated shacks. She played furious bluegrass stompers alongside clenching Memphis soul. Williams and an ex-lover drive through Lafayette and Baton Rouge \"in a yellow Camino listening to Howlin Wolf.\" Loretta, Hank, and ZZ Top are called out by name. \"I see the whole thing like a pitch for a little movie,\" Williams once said.</p><p>But like Flannery O'Connor asserted, \"Southern identity is not really connected with mockingbirds and beaten biscuits… an identity is not to be found on the surface.\" Worlds exist beneath Car Wheels' dazzling edges and monumental hooks. As \"Concrete and Barbed Wire\" evokes its thorny title, Williams wonders about human divides: \"This wall is not real/How can it be real?\" she sings, nearly cracking a yodel, a possible polemic. (The track was once covered on the compilation Sing Me Home: Songs Against Prison.) And Williams took bold risks: The opener \"Right in Time\" includes some of her most irreducible, eloquent poetry&mdash;\"Not a day goes by I don't think about you/You left your mark on me, it's permanent, a tattoo\"&mdash;before becoming a moaned narrative of a woman alone in bed, pleasuring herself. It is unbelievably sensual, a daydream.</p><p>The honky-tonk title track is a sung memoir of an uncertain childhood, set in a Macon, Georgia kitchen with Loretta in the air, the smell of eggs and bacon lingering. At the whim of a disgruntled parent, a young Williams watches the world blur from a car window. When she sings of a \"little bit of dirt mixed with tears,\" she underscores the vulnerability and toughness at the heart of her character&mdash;the shy sense of human imperfection that makes her so heroic, unsettled already from a fixed place. There's an innocence to this phrase, \"Car wheels on a gravel road.\" Williams' melodic wording is sensitive to the bumps you feel, bumps that manifest as chaos and grief and troubled men: drunk men, self-destructive men, men in bands, men doing time, ghost men. Her voice cracks and quivers, allowing ugliness when her subject so demands.</p><p>Earle was deeply inspired by rap in the mid-'90s, particularly Dr. Dre's '92 gangsta rap gamechanger The Chronic. And while there remains no word if Williams shared in that affinity, it's an illuminating prospect: On Car Wheels, her words are dramatically upfront, suspended, locking into mellow grooves. That's especially true on \"2-Kool 2 B 4-Gotten,\" where Williams sings a nonlinear stream of images of rural Mississippi, her most audacious attempt at a surreal, Dylanesque poetry collage. The title of \"2 Kool 2 B 4-Gotten\" was taken from a phrase scrawled on the wall of a Washington County juke joint&mdash;the social gathering spaces of Black Americans in the segregated Jim Crow South&mdash;which she found in a 1990 book, Juke Joint, by the photographer Birney Imes.</p><p>But Williams sets her scene 50 miles north, in Rosedale, perhaps in homage to bluesman Robert Johnson, who she namechecks in the song and who sang of the same town in his \"Traveling Riverside Blues.\" Markings from the wall of yet another Juke Joint photo are scattered through Williams' lyrics: \"No dope smoking no beer sold after 12 o'clock,\" \"No bad language no gambling no fighting,\" \"Sorry no credit don't ask,\" \"Is God the answer YES.\" Williams is like a documentarian of these spaces, which incubated the Delta blues and are extinct today. A humble Imes photo of a juke called Turks Place, in Laflore County, also graces the cover of Car Wheels.</p><p>Williams sings \"2 Kool\" with a toughened poise and a dash of nihilism. \"You can't depend on anything really/There's no promises, there's no point,\" go its opening lines, and while she continues weaving her Southern patchwork&mdash;pointing to a serpent handler outside&mdash;\"2-Kool\" ultimately becomes a eulogy for Williams's ex-boyfriend, Clyde. The jumbled narrative seems to mirror the impossibility of making sense of death; it never quite resolves, feels diffuse, feminine even. When Williams sings of \"Leaning against the railing of a Lake Charles bridge,\" of how her former lover \"asked me baby would you jump in with me,\" it recalls another Southern epitaph: Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billie Joe.\" Williams wrote the easeful, bittersweet Car Wheels ballad \"Lake Charles\" for Clyde as well: \"Did an angel whisper in your ear?\" Williams cries. \"And hold you close and take away your fear/In those long last moments?\" It is as close to perfect as elegies come.</p><p>The soaring, strummed-out build of \"Drunken Angel\" suggests an opening blue sky. Williams's most iconic song is another eulogy, this one for her Texan acquaintance, the outlaw underdog Blaze Foley. She wonders why it had to happen, why he had to die in senseless shootout at 39. Williams' characterization is masterfully vivid: Foley's outcast glory, his slovenliness. As she describes his \"duct tape shoes\" and \"orphan clothes,\" \"Drunken Angel\" becomes an anthemic honoring of these hidden people&mdash;too eccentric, too outside, too much&mdash;who cannot bear this world and who this world, in turn, cannot hold.</p><p>Car Wheels pivots, by side B, to a fully blistering breakup album. Williams knows what belongs at the soul of these pristine songs about merciless heartache, placing them at a nexus of obsession, rejection, and occasional delusion. \"Metal Firecracker\" is a flawless vagabond love song: As she is wont to do, Williams turns two people sitting in a car into a film treatment of just eight lines, remembering when she was his \"queen,\" his \"biker,\" curling that last word with so much effortless twang you can feel the sun in your eyes. \"Once I was in your blood and you were obsessed with me,\" Williams pines. \"You wanted to paint my picture/You wanted to undress me/You wanted to see me in your future.\" Love that is anything less than life-changing infatuation feels fraudulent in Williams' world.</p><p>A gentle and foreboding ballad, \"Greenville\" is the resilient sound of a betrayed woman trying, with impossible grace, to keep a toxic man out of her life. The quiet of the song is in stark contrast to this aggressor who screams and fights and lies, who \"drinks hard liquor and comes on strong,\" who compels Williams to imagine \"empty bottles and broken glass/Busted down doors and borrowed cash.\" \"Looking for someone to save you,\" Williams sings, conjuring the feeling of being used, \"Looking for someone to rave about you.\" Strength and tenderness are rarely entwined so consequentially. The angelic harmonies from Emmylou Harris feel like solidarity, like another woman carrying her safely through.</p><p>The rootless rhythms of travel are survival mechanisms on Car Wheels. The album's finger-picked closer \"Jackson\" is like a drifting Carter Family hymn. The deeper she gets on the road, Williams sings, the less she will miss yet another ex-lover. It's clear this woman knows the game, the fiction, that time alone repairs a wrecked heart. \"Once I get to Lafayette, I'm not gonna mind one bit,\" she sings, convincing herself. \"Once I get to Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you.\" Car Wheels ends in motion, Williams crisscrossing the country in pursuit of herself, the thing she can count on.</p><p>Car Wheels topped the Village Voice's Pazz and Jop critics poll, earned the Grammy Award for Contemporary Folk Album, and entered the Billboard Top 200. In a four star review for Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau began: \"Sometimes it seems Lucinda Williams is too good for this world.\" Still, other critics turned mocking eyes at the supposedly \"nutty\" and delirious \"perfectionism\" Williams demanded. These criticisms would never so beleaguer a male artist&mdash;or as Emmylou Harris put it, \"When a guy takes a long time to make a record, he's a genius. If a woman does that, it's a different matter.\" A Times profile from 1997 illustrated a scene in which Williams' male collaborators questioned her creative decisions and she proved them wrong. When, in ‘98, someone asked Williams what she learned from the process of making Car Wheels, she said, with some reluctance, \"I need to learn to assert myself more in the studio environment because I'm dealing with all men. I wish I had more women to work with.\"</p><p>Reading the tales of how Williams worked on Car Wheels with a record exec knocking, I'm reminded, again, of her heroine Flannery O'Connor, who refused to open the door of her Georgia home until she had completed her morning writing, even with visitors waiting. \"I live in my head, pretty much,\" Williams said in 1998. For all of its journeying, Car Wheels on a Gravel Road emerges as eternal proof that home, inside you, is worth fighting for.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Jenn Pelly</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Between her well-documented determination to retail full control of her music and the plain-spoken willfulness of her best-known songs, Lucinda Williams is practically the working definition of a strong woman you do not want to mess with, but she reveals a very different side of her musical personality on her sixth album, <i>Essence</i>. Subtle and often stark, Essence is an unusually quiet and frequently downbeat set that depicts a fragile emotional vulnerability which rarely makes its presence felt in Williams' music; there's an unadorned longing in songs like \"Blue\" and \"Lonely Girls\" that's new and deeply affecting, and the leaf-in-the-breeze quaver of Williams' voice on \"I Envy the Wind\" is as heart-rending as anything she's ever committed to tape. But while a blue mood dominates <i>Essence</i>, this isn't an album about the blue funk of heartbreak, but a chronicle of the search for transcendence over sorrow in our lives, as her characters look for a path out of isolation (\"Out of Touch\"), try to find answers through faith (\"Get Right With God\"), or reconcile love with the desires of the flesh (\"Essence\"). As a songwriter, Williams has long shown a knack for charting the human heart and mind with intelligence and economy, and Essence finds her at the peak of her form; the delicacy of this music does not speak of weakness, but of the passion and bravery it takes to bare one's soul. And while Williams has gained a certain infamy for her obsessive perfectionism in the studio, the quality of her work speaks for the wisdom of her decision-making process, and Essence proves how well she understands the art of recording; producing in collaboration with Charlie Sexton (Tom Tucker and Bo Ramsey also contributed), Essence sounds full and rich even in its quietest moments, and her sweet-and-sour voice blends with the arrangements with subtle perfection. Those hoping for another dose of the bluesy roots rock of <i>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</i> may be disappointed, but if you want to take a deep and compelling look into the heart and soul of a major artist, then you owe it to yourself to hear Essence.</p>— <b>Mark Deming</b>"

		"review": "<p>Lucinda Williams has earned a reputation for her meticulous approach to making albums, but a careful listen to her work suggests that she isn't trying to make her music sound perfect, she just wants it to sound right, and she isn't afraid to spend the extra time waiting for the charmed moment to get caught on tape. This attitude seems to be borne out in her first-ever concert album, <i>Live @ The Fillmore</i>, which manages to sound carefully considered, and a model of \"warts and all\" authenticity at the same time. Recorded during a three-night stand in San Francisco, the album captures Williams' band in superb form -- Doug Pettibone's guitars, Taras Prodaniuk's bass, and Jim Christie's drums merge into a tight and emphatic groove machine that can match Williams's many moods, whether she's quietly contemplative on \"Blue,\" rocking out hard on \"Changed the Locks,\" or howling the blues on \"Essence,\" while the deeply resonant recording and mix gives them the royal treatment. Williams herself is a slightly more complicated matter here -- her performance is deeply into the spirit, so much so that sometimes her melismatic wanderings and broad phrasing sound like they're verging on caricature. But this is clearly a recording of a performance, and by the time we get to the end of disc two, the broad strokes have coalesced into something quite remarkable; as Williams searches through the nooks and crannies of her songs, you sense she's discovering things that she didn't expect to find, and it's a tremendous thing to hear. Lucinda Williams is an artist who writes from her soul, and she's thoroughly unafraid of letting her passion show when she sings. If that makes for strained technique, it also results in very real art, and this album offers a privileged glimpse of a singular songwriter in full flight.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p><hr/><p>For better or worse, Lucinda Williams has spent the past couple of years living down Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. On Essence and especially World Without Tears, she replaced the Southern storytelling, travelogue nature, and plainspoken poetry of her breakthrough with an increasingly confessional tone and a decreasingly friendly voice. Her disposition has never been exactly sunny and her voice has always been a little gauzy, but she's grown defiantly prickly; as she obsessed over a broken relationship, wondering how it could cause as much happiness as pain, her songs have become more emotionally explicit, her voice more boozily abrasive. \"Ghosts in the wind that blow through my life/ Follow me wherever I go,\" she sings on \"Bus to Baton Rouge\", \"I'll never be free from these chains inside/Hidden deep down in my soul.\"</p><p>This trend toward extreme introversion crystallizes with Live @ the Fillmore, recorded over two nights in San Francisco. While the double live album is a time-honored tradition, Williams makes it immediately clear that this isn't going to be Double Live Gonzo! or Frampton Comes Alive! The first disk begins not with the requisite upbeat showstarter (although this version of \"Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings\" would have been perfect both sonically and thematically), but with a slow ballad&mdash;three of them, in fact. Obviously, this is not the Lucinda Williams of the Car Wheels on a Gravel Road tour (chronicled on a New West Records DVD, released concurrently).</p><p>The 22 songs on these two disks are culled mainly from Essence and World Without Tears, with only a few from Car Wheels, Sweet Old World, and Lucinda Williams (and none from her first two albums). Instead of leading us through the South of \"Crescent City\" and \"Jacksonville\", Williams takes us first out to California on \"Ventura\", one of only three geographically defined songs on the set (\"Pineola\" and \"Bus to Baton Rouge\" being the others). Almost compulsively Williams airs her sins and misgivings on songs like \"Fruits of My Labor\", \"Three Days\", and \"Are You Down\", sounding both gushing and guarded. But her vocals, even on talking-blues songs like \"Sweet Side\" and \"Righteously\", reveal a woman living through all the messy frustration and unalleviated desire she's singing about.</p><p>After a deliberately slow start, Live @ the Fillmore picks up considerably toward the end of the first disk. Williams spits venom on \"Changed the Locks\" and \"Atonement\", while her backing band, especially guitarist Doug Pettibone, generates ferocious bar-blues rock. The second disk reverses that trajectory, starting hard and fast but ending soft. The barreling momentum of \"I Lost It\" and \"Joy\" gradually gives way to the sexual/narcotic fervor of \"Essence\", the low simmer of \"Are You Down\", and the faltering disappointment of \"American Dreams\", which sounds even more like diluted Springsteen in this setting.</p><p>The old Lucinda of Car Wheels reappears briefly on the final two tracks (both of which, ironically, postdate that album). She's there in the detailed memories and interior drama of \"Bus to Baton Rouge\" as well as in the delicate vibrato of \"Words Fell\". Both tracks are a little more hopeful than the equally gentle ones that begin this set, suggesting Williams has managed to exorcise some of those ghosts blowing through her life.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M.

		"review": "<P>While many considered Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and Essence as definitive statements of arrival for Lucinda Williams as a pop star, she \"arrived\" creatively with her self-titled album in 1984 and opened up a further world of possibilities with Sweet Old World. The latter two records merely cemented a reputation that was well-deserved from the outset, though they admittedly confused some of her earliest fans. World Without Tears is the most immediate, unpolished album she's done since Sweet Old World. In addition, it is simply the bravest, most emotionally wrenching record she's ever issued. It offers unflinching honesty regarding the paradoxes inherent in love as both a necessary force for fulfillment and a destructive one when embraced unconsciously. Fans of her more polished, emotionally yearning material may have a hard time here because there isn't one track — of 13 — that isn't right from the gut, ripped open, bleeding, and stripped of metaphors and literary allusions; they're all cut with the fineness of a stiletto slicing through white bone into the heart's blood. World Without Tears is, among other things, predominantly about co-dependent, screwed-up love. It's about relationships that begin seemingly innocently and well-intentioned and become overwhelmingly powerful emotionally and transcendent sexually, until the moment where a fissure happens, baggage gets dumped in the space between lovers, and they turn in on themselves, becoming twisted and destructive — where souls get scorched and bodies feel the addictive, obsessive need to be touched by a now absent other. The whole experience burns to ashes; it becomes a series of tattoos disguised as scars. The experience is lived through with shattering pain and bewilderment until wrinkled wisdom emerges on the other side. Most of Williams' albums have one song that deals with this theme, but with the exception of a couple of songs, here they all do.</P><P>Musically, this is the hardest-rocking record she's ever released, though almost half the songs are ballads. Her road band — on record with her for the first time — cut this one live from the studio floor adding keyboards and assorted sonic textures later. The energy here just crackles. Sure, there's gorgeous country and folk music here. \"Ventura,\" with its lilting verse and lap steel whining in the background, is a paean to be swallowed up in the ocean of love's embrace. In fact, it's downright prosaic until she gets to the last verse: \"Stand in the shower to clean this dirty mess/Give me back my power and drown this unholiness/Lean over the toilet bowl and throw up my confession/Cleanse my soul of this hidden obsession.\" The melodic frame is still moving, but the tune reverses itself: It's no longer a broken-hearted ballad, but a statement of purpose and survival. \"Fruits of My Labor\" is a straight-ahead country song. Williams shimmers with her lyric, her want pouring from her mouth like raw dripping honey. Her words are a poetry of want: \"I traced your scent through the gloom/Till I found these purple flowers/I was spent, I was soon smelling you for hours...I've been trying to enjoy all the fruits of my labor/I've been cryin' for you boy, but truth is my savior.\" One can hear the grain of Loretta Lynn's voice, with an intent so pure and unadorned. But the muck and mire of \"Righteously,\" with its open six-string squall, is pure rock. It's an exhortation to a lover that he need not prove his manhood by being aloof, but to \"be the man you ought to tenderly/Stand up for me.\" Doug Pettibone's overdriven, crunching guitar solo quotes both Duane Allman and Jimi Hendrix near the end of the tune. \"Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings\" is a Rolling Stones-style country-rocker with a lyric so poignant it need not be quoted here. \"Over Time,\" a tome about getting through the heartbreak of a ruined relationship, could have been produced by Daniel Lanois with its warm guitar tremolo and sweet, pure, haunting vocal in front of the mix.</P><P>\"Those Three Days\" may be the most devastating song on the record, with its whimpering lap steel and Williams' half-spoken vocal that questions whether a torrid three-day affair was a lie, a symbolic sacrifice, or the real thing. The protagonist's vulnerability is radical; she feels used, abused — \"Did you only want me for those three days/Did you only need me for those three days/Did you love me forever just for those three days.\" Yet she holds out hope that there is some other explanation as the questions begin to ask themselves from the depth of a scorched heart and a body touched by something so powerful it feels as if it no longer owns itself. Pettibone's solo screams and rings in the bridge to underline every syllable and emotion. \"Atonement\" is something else altogether; it's a punkish kind of blues. If the White Stripes jammed with 20 Miles in a big studio it might sound like this, with Williams singing from the depths of a tunnel for a supreme megaphone effect. She growls and shouts and spits her lyrics from the center of the mix. And Taras Prodaniuk's fuzzed-out basement-level gutter bass is the dirtiest, raunchiest thing on record since early Black Sabbath. \"Sweet Side\" is almost a poem in song, attempts to inspire someone who's been broken by life to accept his goodness. It is not a rap song despite what's been written about it so far. It's more in the tradition of Bob Dylan's early talking blues, but with a modern organic rhythm played by Jim Christie instead of drum loops. In addition, there is the gorgeously tough \"People Talking,\" the most straight-ahead country song Williams has written since \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" (from the Horse Whisperer soundtrack, not the version that appears on Car Wheels, which is dull and lifeless by comparison). Here again, Pettibone's guitar and the slippery, skittering shuffle of Christie's drumming carry Williams' voice to a place where she can sing her protagonist's personal, soul-searing truth without restraint.</P><P>World Without Tears is a work of art in the Henry James sense; it is \"that which can never be repeated.\" It is as fine an album as she could make at this point in her life — which is saying plenty. While she has never strayed from her own vision and has made few compromises, this album risks everything she's built up to now. The audience she's won over time — especially with her last two records — may find it over the top, which would be too damn bad; it'd be their loss. Hopefully, history will prove that World Without Tears sets a new watermark for Williams, and is an album so thoroughly ahead of its time in the way it embraces, and even flaunts, love's contradictions and paradoxes — the same way the human heart does. It is this writer's hope that people will be listening to and learning from it for years to come.</P><P>— <B>Thom Jurek</B></P>"

		"review": "<p>The title of West reflects the change in Lucinda Williams' life as she moved to Los Angeles. It also reflects what had been left behind. Williams is nothing if not a purely confessional songwriter. She continually walks in the shadowlands to bring out what is both most personal yet universal in her work, to communicate to listeners directly and without compromise. If Essence and World Without Tears took chances and stated different sides of the songwriter and her world, West jumps off the ledge into the sky of freedom, where anything can be said without worry of consequence and where anything can be said in any way she wishes. It's entirely appropriate that West was released on the day before Valentine's Day 2007, for it's a record about the heart, about its volumes of brokenness, about its acceptance of its state, and how, with the scars still visible to the bearer, it opens wider and becomes the font of love itself. But the journey is a dark one. First there's the music and the production. Williams chose Hal Willner to produce West. Williams, who'd been writing a lot, demoed some songs before she brought in Willner. He stripped down the demos but kept the scratch vocals. From there, the pair created the rest of the album together, never re-recording Williams' initial vocals. The vocals were accompanied by her guitar playing; Willner wanted her inherent phrasing and rhythmic flow. Willner also brought his own crew to play with Williams. This collaboration &mdash;as unlikely as it might seem on the surface &mdash;results in something utterly different and yet unmistakably Lucinda Williams. West is a warm, inviting, yet very dark record about grief, the loss of love, anger at a lover who cannot deliver, and embracing the possibility of change. In other words, it's not without its redemptive moments. Williams has put all of her qualities on display at once with an unbridled and unbowed sense of adventure here on her eighth album. She, her bandmates, and Willner have come up with exactly what pop music needs: a real work of art based in contemporary forms and feelings. West is Lucinda Williams' magnum opus thus far, an album that will no doubt attract more than a few new fans, and will give old ones, if they are open enough, a recording to relish. West is flawless; it is actually destined to become a classic.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p><hr/><p>Like many genres, country music prizes the personal. Listeners want the impression that an artist sings from experience, that she lives the life she sings about in her songs. Whether it's actually true or not is beside the point. There's no doubt that Lucinda Williams writes what she knows: On two exceptional albums (Lucinda Williams and Car Wheels on a Gravel Road), one really good one (Sweet Old World), and two decent late-career installments (Essence and World Without Tears), she's chronicled her personal romantic ups and downs, the uncertainties that haunt her, and her own Southernness even when regional differences are breaking down. With her divisive vocals and incisive lyrics, it's easy&mdash;maybe too easy&mdash;to regard the singer as indistinguishable from her songs' characters. But she asks for it. Despite her reputation for being lonesome, orn'ry, and mean, the ease with which she expresses herself in country songwriting fueled her legend even when she took nearly a decade between albums.</p><p>With her dreary, deeply disappointing new album, West, which was inspired by the death of her mother and yet another bad break-up, Williams might be getting a little too personal. These songs aren't just about her; they sound like they're written specifically for her, with a larger audience only a dim concern. She employs structural quirks&mdash;eccentric repetitions and digressions, purposefully monotone melodies, talking-blues (read: bad rap) delivery, unjustified song lengths&mdash;like defense mechanisms, keeping listeners from digging too deeply into her songs or identifying too strongly with her. This time she seems to be writing to keep people out, fortressing herself against audience expectations. That evasiveness could be interesting, but here it simply leads to shoddy songwriting and lazily bland music.</p><p>Consider \"Are You Alright?\", whose status as the album's lead-off track and first single suggests it's the most accessible song on West. In the span of five minutes, Williams repeats the title 22 times (that's roughly half the lyrics), which seems a little gutsy, if not outright testy. At first it works: the repetition is hypnotic, like a worrisome thought that won't leave your brain, and the bridge, which contains the album's strongest melodic passage, complements that foreboding nicely. As the song proceeds, it becomes clear she isn't building on that repetition, so it becomes a little grating. Nevertheless, \"Are You Alright?\" proves to be one of the better tracks on West, although you'd probably skip it if it were on any other album.</p><p>On West as on her two previous albums, Williams seems to be trying to free herself from the verse-chorus-verse prison, to find new ways to assemble the same song parts. That's admirable in itself, but here her alternatives don't work. After a passable chorus, \"Mama You Sweet\" digresses into a lengthy tangent tracking the course of pain through a body. Ambiguity is the point: Is the pain her mother's illness or her own grief? Yet it's described so indulgently it sounds goth. On \"Wrap My Head Around That\", Williams works herself into lyrical knots with her scrawled spoken-word delivery, and she draws out the lite-jazz groove for nine unnecessary minutes.</p><p>Elsewhere, West is not so much frustrating as just plain bad. \"Fancy Funeral\" warns against honoring the dead too much, and in its description of an overly lush ceremony, the old Lucinda emerges, but the song's concerns are so pecuniary that buyer's remorse overshadows any actual grief. In the past, Williams has shown a propensity for blatant moon-june-spoon rhymes, which have worked on previous songs (on title track from Essence, for example, the simplicity of the rhyme scheme feeds the song's overwhelming lust). On West, however, it sounds careless. Here's a verse from \"Come On\", a bilious kiss-off that descends into dumb double entendres:</p><p>\"Come On\" at least tries to churn up some rock momentum and give Lucinda a platform to rage against the men who wrong her. The song still fizzles, but the effort is appreciated. But every track seems to sulk along at the same midtempo pace, with the same formless AOR pap that drains the music of melody and all regional specificity. This is \"roots\" music in only the most general sense. Marked by tasteful percussion and ketchupy guitar lines, the production (by Williams and Hal Willner) nods to folk, blues, country, and decades-old rock and roll without actually incorporating any of these styles into the arrangements. If once Williams held these sounds dear enough to meld her personal lyrics to their traditional frameworks, on West she discards them for a generic mush.</p><p>Worst of all, the heartbreak that has been a defining theme in her music sounds newly tedious, the romantic conflicts manufactured. Partly her lyrics are to blame: they incorporate too many common nouns and too few proper ones, and the concrete imagery has given way to vague self-help clichés (the title of \"Learning How to Live\" says it all) and outright nonsense (on the laughable \"What If\", she asks, in all seriousness, \"What if cats walked on water/And birds had bank accounts?\"). On West Williams breaks the first rule of any sort of creative writing: Show, don't tell. She spends so much time rambling about her pain that she never bothers even to try to make us feel it.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The long waits for Lucinda Williams' third and fifth albums&mdash;eight years for Lucinda Williams and six for Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&mdash;have become the defining story of her career. During those lengthy intervals she established herself as a perfectionist who took her own sweet time making records and tweaked every aspect until it met with her highly strict requirements, which of course she never explained to anyone else. She worked intuitively rather than scientifically&mdash;the songs had to feel right. But those albums fully justified both the waits and her peculiar particularity: Williams' self-titled album expressed her inner desires and uncertainties so comfortably that country and blues felt like second skins, and Car Wheels is a tough and tender travelogue. Neither sounds overworked; she toiled for nearly a decade on each to sound completely off the cuff.</p><p>In the decade since Car Wheels, Lucinda has increased her output considerably, releasing three studio albums and a double live with only two or three years between them. If once she was difficult to work with, she has becoming increasingly difficult to listen to, penning uninspired songs that rest uneasily on lyrical clichés, unpalatable vocal scrawls, and a talking-blues delivery that obsessed her but confounded all others. Her gradual downfall sounded like a concerted retreat from roots-rock respectability (no crime there) and an unhealthy, unhappy self-sabotage, and 2007's West was the one thing that no one ever expected from Lucinda: an utterly irredeemable album, short on melodies and insights but long on self-absorption. It would have been a fascinating failure were it not so unfathomably dull.</p><p>Perhaps it's fitting that her new album, Little Honey, begins with \"Real Love\", an unironic, unsentimental statement of newfound happiness that sounds like 1992's Sweet Old World&mdash;or at least Essence. It's not a Mary J. Blige cover: Instead of searching for a real love, she's found one, and it involves a guitar and an audience. Williams reasserts her talent for taking a vague sentiment and unraveling it into something real and immediate. Her vocals sound perfectly slurred, the guitars nicely abrasive, the lyrics suitably modest but incisive. It's enough to raise expectations that Little Honey will be a significant uptick in her output.</p><p>It is. And it isn't. While Williams generally sticks to her strengths and suppresses most of her more unsavory musical habits, she maintains her curious reliance on tacky AABB rhyme schemes and lyrical clichés like \"It's raining cats and dogs\" (on the otherwise excellent \"Circles and X's\"). From anyone else, that line might not warrant scrutiny, but Williams&mdash;the daughter of former poet laureate Miller Williams&mdash;has shown a poet's eye for detail, phrasing, and juxtaposition, laying out her sentiments in a conversational style and downhome cadence, and her earlier work inspired highest standards in her listeners. Lines like that pepper the album, but every bad habit of hers appears in the embarrassing \"Honey Bee\", an anonymous rocker on which she literally shouts her lines: \"Oh my little honeybee/ I'm so glad you found me/ Buzz around you hive now/ You're in overdrive now.\" John Belushi's \"King Bee\" sketch was more dignified.</p><p>After that side-one lull, Little Honey picks up considerably with a string of tracks that recall the old, exacting Williams. She sounds like she might even be having fun on the gospel-blues \"Well Well Well\" and \"Jailhouse Tears\", a duet with Elvis Costello that's a fitting sequel to \"There's a Story in Your Voice\", their previous pairing on his 2004 album The Delivery Man. \"If Wishes Were Horses\" creates an animal metaphor that actually something meaningful: \"If wishes were horses, I'd have a ranch,\" she sings on the lovely chorus. Her vocals are wounded yet measured, as heartbreaking as you know she can be, even on \"Heaven Blues\", which recalls the acoustic blues of her first two albums.</p><p>After such a build-up, it's all the more discouraging that Little Honey falters at the end. \"Plan to Marry\" poses a gorgeously mopey lament: \"Why do we marry? Why do we fall in love? Why do we keep believin'?\" She sounds like she's going to wash her hands of the whole romantic mess, but sadly, those questions don't remain rhetorical: She actually answers them, turning the song into a saccharine lover's anthem. It's a poor lead-in to \"Long Way to the Top\", an aimless AC/DC cover with showy gospel backing vocals and a jaded, defensive tone that leaves a bitter aftertaste. For Lucinda, it's a long way from the top, although it's nothing a good eight years wouldn't fix.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M. Deusner, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Second Winter, Johnny Winter's second album for Columbia, originally had the distinction of being the only album in rock history that was a three-sided double LP. Musically, 35 years after its original release, Second Winter is still an oddity. Issued by Sony's Legacy division, the set has been painstakingly remastered, and expanded by bonus cuts and an entire disc of live material. It's too bluesed-out to be a pure rock record, and too psychedelically dimensioned to be a pure blues album. Tommy Shannon calls it \"power blues.\" And as for whatever else passed for blues-rock at the time -- Cream, Hendrix, Canned Heat, etc. -- forget it. This set is a whole different animal. Cut in Nashville with all tracks begin done within one or two takes, the energy of Second Winter is undeniable. The sheer range of styles Winter assaulted in his restless quest is astonishing too.</p><p>The set begins with a blues-funk cover of Percy Mayfield's classic \"Memory Pain,\" that adds a wealth of rock sonics to the mix. The same goes for the gritty originals like \"I'm Not Sure,\" with its screaming electric mandolin, and the album's closer \"Fast Life Rider.\" The latter two are textured with Edgar's stellar piano work. Then there's the album's centerpiece, the signature cover of Bob Dylan's \"Highway 61 Revisited\" with its burning, gut bucket slide work and Winter's bona fide revival of Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode.\" Trad Delta blues makes its appearance here as well in \"I Love Everybody,\" as does jump jazz in \"I Hate Everybody,\" both of them with Winter's raucous edge. The original album is buoyed here with a pair of bonus tracks, an instrumental version of Ray Charles' \"Tell the Truth,\" as well as the jump blues classic \"Early in the Morning.\" Disc two in the set is an entire unreleased concert from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970 with the same band The show is a monster showcasing all the fiery craziness of Winter's nearly unbelievable guitar mastery on tracks such as \"Mean Town Blues,\" \"Black Cat Bone,\" \"It's My Own Fault,\" \"Tobacco Road,\" and \"Johnny B. Goode.\" It is also significant for the early performance of Edgar's classic, \"Frankenstein\" -- it's a very different, and preferable -- version than the one recorded in the studio. All in all, fantastic sound, an excellent package, and good notes by Andy Aledort make this a welcome addition to the classic rock canon.</p>&mdash; <b>Thom Jurek</b>"

He was a half-forgotten ex-member of some of rock's most progressive (Traffic) and vilified (Blind Faith) bands, and he was considering leaving show business while recording this--his second album--alone and without a backup band. Arc of a Diver reflects a resigned-to-fate mood. It boasts a synth-heavy, dub-like ambience, with dirge-y tracks like \"Spanish Dancer\" and the wistful single \"While You See a Chance\" all but zoning out of your speakers. The fates were kind, though. Recording the single, Winwood inadvertently erased the drum intro. This spacey alteration, together with his catchiest tune since \"Paper Sun,\" catapulted the song onto the charts. In a few years he would be among the top-selling vocalists in the world. His mood was lighter. He could afford to hire engineers that didn't make mistakes.</P>&mdash; <B>Don Harrison</B>"

		"review": "<p>Steve Winwood took an extended break after the ignoble flop of 1997's <I>Junction Seven</I>, resurfacing on his own indie label Wincraft six years later with About Time. Where his last major-label effort fell prey to many of the trappings of a veteran artist gunning for the charts one last time — an overly slick Narada Michael Waldenproduction, cameos from Des'ree and Lenny Kravitz, songs that were too slick and unmemorable — About Time finds Winwood scaling back things considerably, keeping himself to a trio featuring him on a Hammond organ, drummer Walfredo Reyes Jr., and guitarist José Piresde Almeida Neto. Occasionally, congas and timbales and other percussion flesh out the rhythm, while Karl Denson plays flute or saxophone elsewhere, but these are subtle additions to a loose, laid-back, intimate album that harks back to Traffic, even if it is never as freewheeling or unpredictable as that band.</p> <p>Winwood's ambitions with About Time are pretty modest, actually — to cut R&amp;B-based tunes that bring in jazz and Latin influences and give everybody the chance to jam. Though they meander a bit too much at times, the jams are warm and appealing, and while the songs are a little indistinct, the feel of the music is good, which counts for a lot, since the last two slick solo albums felt distant (surely a byproduct of records that were designed to be <i>Roll With It</i>, Pt. 2). If Winwood's voice is now a little rough (which comes as a surprise), it nevertheless fits the scaled-down, relaxed atmosphere. And if individual songs aren't necessarily memorable, they don'tnecessarily need to be — the feel is the thing here, and while it isn't first-rate Steve Winwood, it does feel like a welcome update from an old friend, which, after several years of waiting and several uneven records, is enough.</p><p> — <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>When Stevie Wonder applied his tremendous songwriting talents to the unsettled social morass that was the early '70s, he produced one of his greatest, most important works, a rich panoply of songs addressing drugs, spirituality, political ethics, the unnecessary perils of urban life, and what looked to be the failure of the '60s dream -- all set within a collection of charts as funky and catchy as any he'd written before. Two of the highlights, \"Living for the City\" and \"Too High,\" make an especially deep impression thanks to Stevie's narrative talents; on the first, an eight-minute mini-epic, he brings a hard-scrabble Mississippi black youth to the city and illustrates, via a brilliant dramatic interlude, what lies in wait for innocents. (He also uses his variety of voice impersonations to stunning effect.) \"Too High\" is just as stunning, a cautionary tale about drugs driven by a dizzying chorus of scat vocals and a springing bassline. \"Higher Ground,\" a funky follow-up to the previous album's big hit (\"Superstition\"), and \"Jesus Children of America\" both introduced Wonder's interest in Eastern religion. It's a tribute to his genius that he could broach topics like reincarnation and transcendental meditation in a pop context with minimal interference to the rest of the album. Wonder also made no secret of the fact that \"He's Misstra Know-It-All\" was directed at Tricky Dick, aka Richard Milhouse Nixon, then making headlines (and destroying America's faith in the highest office) with the biggest political scandal of the century. Putting all these differing themes and topics into perspective was the front cover, a striking piece by Efram Wolff portraying Stevie Wonder as the blind visionary, an artist seeing far better than those around him what was going on in the early '70s, and using his astonishing musical gifts to make this commentary one of the most effective and entertaining ever heard.</p><p>&mdash; <b>John Bush</b></p>"

		"review": "<p>On Yes' first two albums, Yes (1969) and Time and a Word (1970), the quintet was mostly searching for a sound on which they could build, losing one of their original members -- guitarist Peter Banks -- in the process. Their third time out proved the charm -- The Yes Album constituted a de facto second debut, introducing the sound that would carry them forward across the next decade or more. Gone are any covers of outside material, the group now working off of its own music from the ground up. A lot of the new material was actually simpler -- in linear structure, at least -- than some of what had appeared on their previous albums, but the internal dynamics of their playing had also altered radically, and much of the empty space that had been present in their earlier recordings was also filled up here -- suddenly, between new member Steve Howe's odd mix of country- and folk-based progressive guitar and the suddenly liberated bass work and drumming of Chris Squire and Bill Bruford, respectively, the group's music became extremely busy. And lead singer Jon Anderson, supported by Squire and Howe, filled whatever was left almost to overflowing. Anderson's soaring falsetto and the accompanying harmonies, attached to haunting melodies drawn from folk tunes as often as rock, applied to words seemingly derived from science fiction, and all delivered with the bravura of an operatic performance -- by the band as well as the singer -- proved a compelling mix. What's more, despite the busy-ness of their new sound, the group wasn't afraid to prove that less could sometimes be more: three of the high points were the acoustic-driven \"Your Move\" and \"The Clap\" (a superb showcase for Howe on solo acoustic guitar), and the relatively low-key \"A Venture\" (oddly enough, the latter was the one cut here that didn't last in the group's repertory; most of the rest, despite the competition from their subsequent work, remained in their concert set for years to come). The Yes Album did what it had to do, outselling the group's first two long-players and making the group an established presence in America where, for the first time, they began getting regular exposure on FM radio. Sad to say, the only aspect of The Yes Album that didn't last much longer was Tony Kaye on keyboards: his Hammond organ holds its own in the group's newly energized sound, and is augmented by piano and other instruments when needed, but he resisted the idea of adding the Moog synthesizer, that hot instrument of the moment, to his repertory. The band was looking for a bolder sound than the Hammond could generate, and after some initial rehearsals of material that ended up on their next album, he was dropped from the lineup, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p><hr/><p>I. Exposition: Time and a WordOdds are you already have an opinion on Yes, and since you're reading this website, there's a good chance that your view of them isn't a favorable one.  Despite the fact that a formidable portion of the music we love (anyone from Radiohead and Super Furry Animals to Hella) is directly influenced by Yes and their prog-rock peers, we tend to look at the early 70's through punk's distorting lens, and that lens shows us images of dinosaur muso wankers lumbering from stadium to stadium with comically oversized light shows and Victorian clothing (never mind that punk itself became a mill of convention and spectacle in only a few short years).Of course, there's quite a nugget of truth to that image; on-again-off-again Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman staging his Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table album as an ice show alone     demonstrates how out of hand things could get when the budget was too big and judgment was lacking.</p><p>When you move beyond the pageantry and pomp, though, you're left with some pretty interesting music. Yes were the most popular and longest lasting of the quartet of bands that defined progressive rock in the early 70's.  Genesis, ELP, and King Crimson were the others, and listening back to them, it's easy to see why Yes won out. For all their lengthy songs, virtuoso musicianship and softheaded philosophical musings, Yes were fundamentally approachable, even radio-friendly.  Try listening to \"Roundabout\" or \"I've Seen All Good People\" without getting them stuck in your head. Of course, there's a certain ridiculousness to the grandiose Roger Dean artwork, would-be poetic lyrics (random sample: \"Battleships, confide in me and tell me where     you are!\"), and multi-part suite naming formulas-- but then, that's part of why Yes got listened to in the first place.Nevertheless, a past penchant for prog is a major skeleton in the closet for a lot of people, but as Rhino reissues the first eleven Yes studio albums, it feels as good a time as any to let the bones rattle in public.</p><p>Feel free to forgo the band's first two albums with guitarist Peter Banks (we did), records that feature a band still finding its feet and occasionally hitting on something great, like \"Astral Traveler\", but often stumbling.</p><p>II. The Albums: The Solid Time of Change Yes had already released two albums, but 1971's The Yes Album was the record that put them on American FM radio and into millions of living rooms around the world. With guitarist Steve Howe on board for the first time, it also established the classic Yes sound, where essentially any instrument could take the lead at any time.  Drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Chris Squire (the only member to appear on every Yes album)     were a tight and angular, almost funky rhythm section by this point, while Howe's slashing guitar parts fit nicely into that mix. The two-part \"I've Seen All Good People\" is one of the band's best singles, while     Howe's slow, spacey guitar build at the end of \"Starship Trooper\" is one of the great Yes moments.  Howe also shows off his acoustic chops on \"The Clap\", a rollicking rag that bears little resemblance to anything     else in the band's catalog (the original album version was a live recording, the reissue also appends a slightly crisper studio version). </p><p>This album showcases Yes at their most concise, and is probably the best starting point. 1972's Fragile introduced Yes' highest-powered line-up, as the silver-cape wearing, 12-keyboard-hauling Rick Wakeman replaced the mediocre Tony Kaye. But the question is, what was \"fragile?\" Their egos? The battle between the perfectly balanced arrangements-- as on classic rock radio staples \"Roundabout\" and \"Long Distance Runaround\"-- and each virtuoso's need to grandstand, vented through five solo interludes (most memorably Steve Howe's \"Mood for a Day\")? All that firepower could have ruined the band, yet on Fragile, they put songcraft firmly over indulgence. The intriguing middle section of \"South Side of the Sky\" might've  blown up like a laser light show had they recorded it in the late 70's, and even though the band had a knack for crescendos and flighty, eagle-centric lyrics, they were more likely to get high through chugging guitars and Bruford's precise drumwork than outright bombast. \"Heart of the Sunrise\" still holds up as a deftly constructed proto math-rock epic, and Jon Anderson would never sing a lyric as plainly as \"I feel lost in     the city\" again.</p><p>The band's crowning achievement, Close to the Edge, contains only three lengthy \"songs,\" but each one is an absolute epic. The title track dominates all of side one of the original LP, rushing in with a burbling, dissonant intro, Howe's jagged riffing and Wakeman's fluttering fingers building a dense, overpowering texture. Squire's bass in the majestic \"Total Mass Retain\" section could liquefy solid tissue at the right volume; it's almost impossible to believe it hasn't been made into a hip-hop sample yet. Most importantly, the title track has a sense of coherent progression, tension and release that most of the band's other side-filling epics lack. \"And You and I\" is arguably the ten most gorgeous minutes Yes ever laid to tape. It begins humbly, with twelve-string acoustic guitar, rises through mellotron-soaked crescendos, and then does it all again, building to a huge closing climax called \"Apocalypse\", essentially laying out the blueprint for Sigur Rós. That leaves \"Siberian Khatru\" to close out the album with nine minutes of hook-stuffed organ and guitar interplay, understated harmony vocals and more of Squire's chunky, front-and-center bass playing.     This record is an essential document of just how powerful prog could be when focused.</p><p>It couldn't last. On 1974's Tales from Topographic Oceans, they simply took things too far. Anderson's lyrics (supposedly based on Japanese \"shastrick\" scriptures, wtf?) are pure astral hogwash, and even worse, they're printed so you can read them. The band seems totally disinterested in communicating musically, and each of the four twenty-minute compositions (that's right, a double LP with four songs on it) squanders its few inspired moments. \"The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)\" is the most promising, opening with what should be an exhilarating passage of rushing keyboards topped by a blistering solo from Howe, but new drummer Alan White can't keep up the intensity like Bruford (by then defected to King Crimson) had, and it collapses under its own weight. Likewise, a pretty choral verse intervenes toward the end of \"The Remembering (High the Memory)\", but comes too late to salvage the listless keyboard washes and lame noodling.</p><p>It was exactly this type of excess that had fans saying \"no\" to Yes for the first time in their career. Even Wakeman was so disgusted that he quit after the album's completion. Possibly to recoup their rep, Yes quickly made for the studio in the hopes of turning out another masterwork. However, in spite of the flashy musicianship that made Relayer a fan-favorite, the record is all but unlistenable to the rest of the world. Noisy and grotesque, it betrays some of the most atrocious taste of any Yes record. Temporary member Patrick Moraz shows up with his own bank of keyboards that sound even more tweaked than Wakeman's, and he pushes the band to garish new soundworlds; \"Gates of Delirium\" is a kind of nightmare children's book story about men (or elves? hobbits??) going to war. The band recreates the battle     in a jaw-droppingly over-the-top instrumental that fades into a longing, eerie finale. That's followed by \"Soundchaser\", a vomit stew of jarring rhythms and bastardized funk climaxing with Anderson's infamous \"cha     cha cha\" section. And \"To Be Over\" would've been pretty if they hadn't jammed it with instrumentals. Someone once told me that this is what they should have blasted at Noriega to drive him out of that nunnery; casual listeners turned their backs on this mess, while fans that could appreciate its dissonant, virtuosic extremes hid under their headphones and just kept basking.</p><p>After an extended hiatus following Relayer, Yes regrouped for 1977's Going for the One, bringing grand old ham Wakeman back to record an album of much fewer pretensions than anything they'd done since Fragile.  Of course, that really meant only one 15-minute epic instead of four, but right down to the non-Roger Dean cover art, it signaled a new start for Yes. The title track, with Howe's great steel-guitar opening riff, did indeed reveal a band that still knew how to rock even if lyrics like, \"Get the idea cross around the track, underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser,\" exposed their hippie-mystic trappings. However, Squire's \"Parallels\" and the Beatlesque \"Wonderous Stories\" forecast the band's 80s rebirth as pop stars.  Furthermore, the album's lone concession to headier days and side-length symphonettes, \"Awaken\", was a fairly amazing example of how Yes could fuse new age sentiments and reverb-drenched tinker-bell soliloquies, yet somehow come out unscathed. Sure, it went on a bit too long, but in retrospect, it was a fine last gasp for a band concerned with \"progress\" in the 70's.</p><p>Perhaps inspired by the fact they didn't all hate each other after finishing Going for the One, Yes took the same lineup in for 1978's Tormato.  However, even as streamlined song-lengths and a couple     of attempts at pop crossover appeared, the band sounded desperate rather than invigorated. Primary offenders on an album among the most hated of all hated Yes records include the flat, rigid \"Don't Kill the Whale\", in which Wakeman managed to insert ridiculously baroque synth stylings into a would-be Greenpeace disco protest anthem, while Anderson pleads with us to \"dig it.\" And whomever thought it was a good idea to invite Anderson's kid to twee it up on \"Circus of Heaven\" should probably have been fired on the spot. Oh right: it was Anderson, and he left right after this record. It's too bad, because relatively aggressive, driving numbers like \"Future Times\" and the fusion-tinged \"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\" weren't bad, even if the album's lack of punch throughout sucked the life out of most of the music.</p><p>With Anderson's and Wakemen's defections, Yes recognized that they could no longer continue in the same lackluster manner as on Tormato.  At the end of the 1970s, the band finally felt ready to embrace a new era. A Buggles era! Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, possessing neat new synthesizers and actual MTV experience, joined for 1980's Drama, and paved the way for a decade of Yes at their most pop-friendly. The transition, however, was not an easy one.  For starters, longtime fans weren't fooled for a minute by Horn's vocals, which didn't quite hit those high notes as easily as Anderson. Also, songs like \"White Car\" and \"Into the Lens\" just didn't sound like Yes, rather like Yes-influenced, overblown AOR fare. However, \"Machine Messiah\", \"Does It Really Happen?\" and especially the new-wave-meets-prog of \"Tempus Fugit\" were better than anything the band had done in years and, doubtlessly due to the Buggle-presence, sparkled with state-of-the-art production sheen. Of course, this lineup would disband shortly after the record, but lessons were learned and the next time Yes graced the world with an album, the world listened.</p><p>On Drama, Horn had simply attempted to emulate Jon Anderson, but by the time he produced 1983's 90125 for the (yet again) newly reformed and reconfigured Yes, he had become the synth-pop genius     behind ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the Zang Tuum Tumb label, and gets no small share of credit for reinventing Yes as a hit 80's pop band.  The extensive drum and horn samples on \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" and the glowing a capella on \"Leave It\" turned those songs into radio hits; but just when you think they've sold out, they write elaborate pop songs like \"It Can Happen\" or characteristically bizarre lyrics like, \"This world I like/ We architects of life,\" or, \"Your heart is inside your head.\" This line-up formed practically from scratch, bringing Squire and White back together with Anderson and the long-lost Tony Kaye; Trevor Rabin-- the only one who didn't bleach his hair-- completed the band with an 80's hard rock guitar sound that's the most dated thing about the record. Still, if you can handle the style-disconnect, 90125's songcraft makes it one of their tightest records.</p><p>III. Recapitulation: High the Memory Yes may have disappeared commercially after 90125, but they're still active today in varying lineups, and have a full nine subsequent studio albums that Rhino has wisely chosen not to reissue. The much-delayed follow-up to 90125, Big Generator, was a dud of spectacular proportions (in all seriousness: 0.0), and few of their subsequent releases are much better. For all intents and purposes, the band that tours now is something of a traveling history lesson, so it'll be interesting to see how hindsight treats them in another twenty or so years, when they've finally hung it up and rested on their laurels.  For now, don't surround yourself with yourself and move on back a square.  Yes would love to meet you.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Chris Dahlen, Dominique Leone & Joe Tangari, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

Even so, the results weren't conventional, because the group didn't tone down or turn down its sound. Much of Time and a Word relies on bold, highly animated performances by Bill Bruford, Chris Squire, and Tony Kaye. Additionally, by this time the group was developing a much tauter ensemble than was evident on their first LP, so there's no lack of visceral excitement. \"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\" was a bold opening, a highly amplified, frenzied adaptation of the Richie Havens song, melded with Jerome Moross' title music from the movie The Big Country. Somewhat more successful musically is \"Then,\" which keeps the orchestral accompaniment to a minimum and allows Kaye and Banks to stretch out on organ and guitar. \"Everydays\" is highlighted by Anderson's ethereal vocals and Kaye's dueting with the orchestra. A surprising amount of the material here seems rather tuneless, but the group was solidifying its sound and, in the process, forcing Banks out of the lineup, despite some beautiful moments for him (and Tony Kaye) on the prettiest parts of \"The Prophet,\" a piece that also contains fragments of music that anticipate Yes' work right up through Tales from Topographic Oceans. \"Astral Traveller,\" as a title, anticipates the themes of future group work, though they still don't have the dexterity to pull off the tempo changes they're trying for. By the time the record was completed, Banks was out of the band, which is why Steve Howe, his successor, ended up pictured on the cover of most editions.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>On Yes' first two albums, Yes (1969) and Time and a Word (1970), the quintet was mostly searching for a sound on which they could build, losing one of their original members -- guitarist Peter Banks -- in the process. Their third time out proved the charm -- The Yes Album constituted a de facto second debut, introducing the sound that would carry them forward across the next decade or more. Gone are any covers of outside material, the group now working off of its own music from the ground up. A lot of the new material was actually simpler -- in linear structure, at least -- than some of what had appeared on their previous albums, but the internal dynamics of their playing had also altered radically, and much of the empty space that had been present in their earlier recordings was also filled up here -- suddenly, between new member Steve Howe's odd mix of country- and folk-based progressive guitar and the suddenly liberated bass work and drumming of Chris Squire and Bill Bruford, respectively, the group's music became extremely busy. And lead singer Jon Anderson, supported by Squire and Howe, filled whatever was left almost to overflowing. Anderson's soaring falsetto and the accompanying harmonies, attached to haunting melodies drawn from folk tunes as often as rock, applied to words seemingly derived from science fiction, and all delivered with the bravura of an operatic performance -- by the band as well as the singer -- proved a compelling mix. What's more, despite the busy-ness of their new sound, the group wasn't afraid to prove that less could sometimes be more: three of the high points were the acoustic-driven \"Your Move\" and \"The Clap\" (a superb showcase for Howe on solo acoustic guitar), and the relatively low-key \"A Venture\" (oddly enough, the latter was the one cut here that didn't last in the group's repertory; most of the rest, despite the competition from their subsequent work, remained in their concert set for years to come). The Yes Album did what it had to do, outselling the group's first two long-players and making the group an established presence in America where, for the first time, they began getting regular exposure on FM radio. Sad to say, the only aspect of The Yes Album that didn't last much longer was Tony Kaye on keyboards: his Hammond organ holds its own in the group's newly energized sound, and is augmented by piano and other instruments when needed, but he resisted the idea of adding the Moog synthesizer, that hot instrument of the moment, to his repertory. The band was looking for a bolder sound than the Hammond could generate, and after some initial rehearsals of material that ended up on their next album, he was dropped from the lineup, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Bruce Eder</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>We all know the classic Yes live album Yessongs inside out, and have been listening to it and loving it for nearly 40 years. Documenting the bands 1972 tour of Close to the Edge, it's a landmark live album and considered one of the best ever in the genre of progressive rock. Problem is, Yessongs always had somewhat of a muddy sound, a problem even the remastered edition didn't really rectify, but considering the time and conditions it was recorded under, there's not been a lot that can be done to clean it up. Fast forward now many years, and a box of reel-to-reel tapes have been found of 7 shows from the same tour, all recorded at concerts in North America virtually a few days apart in 1972, each with very strong audio quality made even better by using modern day 'clean up' and restoration techniques. There is a 14CD box set that includes all 7 full shows available for completists to have to hear every available concert, but this particular 2 disc version contains the best performances from those shows. The sound quality is amazing, crystal clear so you can hear every little nuance being played by Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, Chris Squire, Jon Anderson, and Alan White, which is not something you could always say about Yessongs. In many ways, Progeny can now almost be looked at as the ultimate live Yes album from that era, except, and of course there's always an 'except', that a few tunes from Yessongs, namely \"Starship Trooper\", \"Long Distance Runaround\", and \"Perpetual Change\" are nowhere to be found here, nor on the larger box sets, so either they didn't play them on the US part of the tour or the decision was made to leave them off these collections.</p><p>That aside, what is on display here is magical, vintage Yes at the height of their powers. I won't go into the virtues of classic songs like \"And You and I\", \"Heart of the Sunrise\", \"Roundabout\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Yours Is No Disgrace\", \"Close to the Edge\", and my personal favorite \"Siberian Khatru\", as we are all aware of just how great these tunes are, but the clarity of these recordings and the powerful performances are what makes them exceptional. The late Chris Squire looms tall with his thudding, muscular, and quite elastic Rickenbacker bass, as Howe's virtuoso guitar lines and Wakeman's majestic keyboards dazzle and dart around each other, but the real surprise here is just how clear & powerful White's drums sound. Remember, he was the brand new guy for this tour, and literally had to learn the entire set list in a matter of days, so his outstanding performances on these recordings is astounding. And, what more can you say about Howe & Wakeman, who get their little moments to shine solo on \"Clap/Mood For a Day\" and \"Excerpts From 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII\"...these guys are just masters of their craft. The always solid Anderson just floats over the top of all these grandiose sounds, but he's especially wondrous on the always engaging \"And You and I\" and an aggressive take on \"Yours Is No Disgrace\".</p><p>Of course, a brand new, stunning Roger Dean work of art adorns the lovely digipack, and a booklet filled with information on these recordings and their history slots in nicely inside. Like I mentioned earlier, if you have to have the complete concerts (which would really give you something that rivals and even surpasses Yessongs) then go for the full-blown 14 disc box set. Many will probably be happy enough with this 'highlights' set, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Pete Pardo</strong></p><hr/><p>Cognoscenti may or may not agree this material constitutes Yes' holy grail as the group became ever-so-slightly more structured with the departure of original drummer Bill Bruford (to join King Crimson)and the subsequent enlistment of Alan White to fulfill that role. But the somewhat rigidified presentations of these shows belies how the vocal and instrumental expertise is catalyzed by the extraordinary self-discipline evident on \"I've Seen All Good People.\" </p><p>There's no denying the enthralling and uplifting sensation of the latter and that force is even greater later in the show during the greater complexity of \"Roundabout;\" the intricacy of Steve Howe's electric guitar as it interweaves with Rick Wakeman's keyboards and Chris Squire's bass mirror the shifting textures even more graphically, all the while maintaining, and even elevating the visceral impact of the musicianship. White's comparatively simpler approach to his kit actually keeps Yes from sound too busy for the own good. In contrast, while some of the lyrics of \"Siberian Khatru, \" for instance, sound esoteric to a fault, the pastoral images can lend to the rapture Yes aims to create. </p><p>Still, workouts like \"Heart of the Sunrise\" (and even more Howe's solo \"Clap\"/Mood for a Day\" and Wakeman's spotlight \"Excerpts from The Six Wives of Henry VIII\") lend themselves to the criticism of technical braggadocio, unless they're taken as pure sonic expression, but the latter the acoustic-based number adds markedly to the dynamic flow of the concert , particularly as it sets up \"And You and I\" where the deceptively frail sound of Jon Anderson's voice comes to the for as a major asset of the Yes sound even more so as part of the billowing group harmonies when Howe and Squire join in. </p><p>Co-producers Steve Woolard and Brian Kehew create a seamless progression of performances here from performances straddling North America including North Carolina, Nassau Long Island and Toronto Canada. In doing so the detailed clarity of the audio quality reveals \" Opening\" (Excerpt from \"Firebird Suite\") less pretension that pragmatism given the tuning enacted in the background. </p><p>Further such nuance below the surface of the most prominent components of the arrangements is worthy of selective scrutiny here, all the more remarkable given the age of the recordings (notwithstanding Yes long-standing devotion to audio quality). The unadorned mix reveals the exertion expended by the group as they play, the antithesis of antiseptic, especially played at high-volume (headphone listening doesn't offer the same insight). \"Close to the Edge, \" for instance, moves at a breathless pace. </p><p>A highly-distinctive 'greatest hits' set for the novice, Highlights From Seventy-Two is also available for nostalgists in the form of a of a three-LP set of vinyl, while for the completists, there's a fourteen-disc box titled Seven Shows From Seventy- Two comprising the fruits of this archiving project in their entirety. All these various configurations are but a further reflection of the multi-colored density of this music.</p><p>Track Listing: CD 1: Opening (Excerpt From “Firebird Suite”); Siberian Khatru. I’ve Seen All Good People. a. “Your Move b. “All Good People. Heart Of The Sunrise; Clap/Mood For A Day; And You And I: a. Cord Of Life b. Eclipse. c. The Preacher The Teacher. d. Apocalypse.

Seasons Of Man; Excerpts From “The Six Wives Of Henry VIII; Roundabout; Yours Is No Disgrace.</p><p>Personnel: Jon Anderson: vocals, percussion; Steve Howe: guitar, vocals ; Chris Squire: bass, vocals; Rick Wakeman: keyboards; Alan White: drums</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Doug Collette</strong></p><hr/><p>If ever there were too much of a good thing, Progeny: Seven Shows from Seventy-Two by Yes is likely it. These seven complete shows on as many double-disc sets were recorded in Canada and the U.S. between October 31 and November 20 during the Close to the Edge tour. They are the \"source code\" tapes from which much of Yessongs was assembled. That said, these complete gigs are remixed and remastered from two-inch, 16-track recordings previously thought to be lost. (Yessongs was created from two-track mixdown masters -- each subsequent remaster has come from those tapes.) Drummer Alan White had been with the band just three months after taking over from Bill Bruford. Musically, however, he's claimed the chair by this point; his uncanny playing relationship with bassist Chris Squire is cemented. The sonic quality of these concerts and the considerable variation in improvisational and instrumental moments, banter, and sheer dynamic force from night to night -- remember, this set is for the hardest of the hardcore only; civilians and casual fans won't get it -- are well worth it.</p><p>Producer Brian Kehew's technical notes detail the painstaking process of getting the best sound possible and recapturing the dynamic range that Yessongs lacked. Some of the tricks included re-recording Squire's bass through a '70s-era bass amp and layering it atop the original thin one to get the fat, nasty, proper balance that is a Yes trademark. They also (re)calibrated the Dolby level of each guitar, individual drum, vocal, keyboard, etc. track setting by ear because they had been set incorrectly in the first place. That doesn't mean that the sound is perfect. Occasionally one can hear bits of ambient buzzing, a little too much crowd noise in a few places, moments of brightness -- as in the Duke University performance of Steve Howe's solo guitar break that makes a medley of \"Mood for a Day\" with \"Clap.\" But these are quibbles. For fans, this box is about representing the performance magic of Yes at an early peak. Jon Anderson is at full, soaring, angelic strength. Rick Wakeman's B-3 and synth playing are on point, his synths soaring and free of bloated excess. Howe, Squire, and White surprise audiences and one another nightly with their interplay and solos. Each of these shows does exactly that. Whether it's in the extended jams like \"Yours Is No Disgrace\" or the \"Close to the Edge\" and \"And You and I\" suites, or awe-inspiring renderings of \"Heart of the Sunrise\" and the driving hard rock prog of \"Roundabout,\" Yes were firing on all cylinders. Progeny is what rabid fans want; it captures not only the band at its early, inspired best but prog rock too. The new sleeve art by Roger Dean (each set has a different illustration) helps make this deluxe set a necessity for the obsessed.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Thom Jurek</strong></p>"

After all, how else but on a triple-LP collection could one hope to re-create (and/or contain) an adequate sampling of Yes' live presentation? Especially since their tunes typically clocked in in excess of ten minutes. Although they had turned in five studio long-players, the vast majority of Yessongs (1973) is drawn from their three most recent endeavors The Yes Album (1970), Fragile (1971), and Close to the Edge (1972). There are two exceptions, the first being the \"Opening (Excerpt from \"Firebird Suite\")\" -- which comes from the 1969 Boston Symphony Orchestra's recording, conducted by Seiji Ozawa. The other is Rick Wakeman's keyboard solo \"Excerpts from 'The Six Wives Of Henry VIII'.\" Yes had just undergone a personnel change shortly after concluding work on Close to the Edge as Bill Bruford (percussion) left to join King Crimson in July of 1972. Bruford can be heard on \"Perpetual Change,\" as well as the medley of \"Long Distance Runaround\" and \"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus).\" Enthusiasts keen on various and arguably irrelevant minutia should note the spelling of \"praimaturus\" as credited on Yessongs. It is slightly different from Fragile, which is denoted as \"praematurus.\" That bit of trivia aside, the new lineup finds Alan White (drums), quite ably filling Bruford's shoes, alongside Jon Anderson (vocals), Steve Howe (guitars), Chris Squire (bass/vocals), and Rick Wakeman (keyboards).</p><p>One of their trademarks has always been an ability to re-create their often densely layered sound in concert. They effortlessly pull off the tricky chord progressions and changes in time signatures of \"Siberian Khatru\" and a sublime \"Heart of the Sunrise,\" which unquestionably bests the dexterity of its carefully crafted studio counterpart. Both Howe and Squire's respective solos during \"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\" are highlights as they give the entire unit an opportunity to show off their capacity for dramatic dynamics. The remainder of Yessongs is similarly strong, particularly the note-perfect \"Close to the Edge,\" and the inspired concluding instrumental jam during \"Starship Trooper.\" However, one criticism that can be leveled at the entire Yessongs release is the less than optimal audio quality throughout. The sound is generally muddy with no real fidelity to speak of and an even less precise stereoscape. But until someone goes back to the multi-tracks and remixes them for 21st century ears, this is as good as it gets when documenting Yes during this seminal transition period.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Lindsay Planer</strong></p>"

The key to this collection is in the title: this is the band's \"classic\" music. Anything prior to The Yes Album is cut out, no attempt is made to salvage snippets from Relayer or Tales from Topographic Oceans; Drama and Tormato are dispensed with. What remains is what made this band great: the science fiction and fantasy-laced epics, the tangible wizardry of their arrangements, moments that crystallized the magical power of music, and two unreleased live tracks from 1978 that find the band tethered to the realm of mortals.\" The logic behind the live tracks is pretty simple: \"Roundabout\" and \"I've Seen All Good People\" are two tracks that missed the original LP cut, so live versions of them were included with the LP as a bonus 45 rpm single. This is only a minor complaint, though, and one easily overlooked in lieu of the music that made the first cut. Squire's picks are undoubtedly the right ones: \"Heart of the Sunrise\" to start things off, \"And You and I\" in all its ten-minute glory, \"Starship Trooper\" and \"Yours Is No Disgrace\" from their third album, and \"Long Distance Runaround\" and \"The Fish.\" Classic Yes remains the place to start if you're interested in the band or just want to hear their best music in one sitting.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Dave Connolly</strong></p>"

With Magnification, Yes has taken that a step further, adding a symphony orchestra. The orchestra is not simply thrown over the top, though; the songs were written for this particular grouping. Yes has flirted with this type of thing before. Released in 1969, the Time and a Word album featured a string section, but the complete integration is what makes Magnification a superior work. The material on the CD is pretty standard modern Yes fare, but the addition of that symphony really does create a whole new texture. It also seems as if it inspired the band, and some members put in performances that are head and shoulders above their recent work. The album does have its weak moments and gets just a little over the top at times, but there are a lot more moments that shine than dull ones.</p>&mdash; <b>Gary Hill</b>"

		"review": "<p>Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968 the third installment from Neil Young's Archives -- although through some weird filing system this is Vol. 00, possibly because this dates before either of the previously released volumes in Archives Performance Series -- culls highlights from Neil Young's two shows at Canterbury House in Ann Arbor, MI on November 9 and 10, 1968. Like its two predecessors in the Archives series, the concerts captured on Sugar Mountain are legendary among Neil Young collectors, in this case because of the gentle, tentative version of the title track that showed up on Decade -- prior to this, the only official release from the concert. At first glance, Sugar Mountain might seem similar to Live at Massey Hall 1971, as they're both solo acoustic sets, but the tenor of the two shows is quite different. Massey Hall captured Neil in full flight, just before the release of Harvest, whereas the concerts on Sugar Mountain were just a month or two shy of the release of his first solo album. He had hits with Buffalo Springfield -- much of the set list leans heavily on Springfield songs, such as \"Mr. Soul,\" \"Expecting to Fly,\" \"Birds,\" \"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing,\" and \"Broken Arrow\" -- but he had yet to prove himself as a solo artist, so the endearing tentative quality of his performances shouldn't come as a surprise, and yet it does: Young's reputation as a steely renegade often suggests that he never second-guesses his moves. Neil doesn't second-guess here but he is fragile and human, telling stories (sometimes at considerable length) before sliding into these delicate songs, wryly lamenting that he should have some happy songs to sing before testing out the melody for \"Winterlong,\" stopping short because the song isn't quite written yet. It's a marvelously intimate performance, unguarded and open-hearted, unique in its delicate touch: it's Neil Young before the myth crystallized, and listening to it anew, it's easy to fall in love with him all over again.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Neil Young has always sounded simultaneously young and old. His creaky voice conveys innocence, but it also feels wise and nostalgic, as if its fault lines developed over centuries. That's why, in his mid-twenties, Young could get away with singing that he was a lot like an old man&mdash;it sure sounded like the truth. On most of Young's recordings, the balance between age and youth skews toward the former. He experienced so much so early&mdash;reaching success at age 21 with Buffalo Springfield, then quickly launching a prolific solo career&mdash;that wisdom was branded on him immediately. By the time people even knew who Young was, he sounded more like a wily veteran than a green youngster.</p><p>Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968 offers a chance to hear Young with the scales tipped the other direction. It's taken from his first two post-Buffalo Springfield solo acoustic concerts, performed in a ministry on the University of Michigan campus. Unheard until now, these shows have gained legend due to one song from them, \"Sugar Mountain\", popping up on B-sides and the Decade compilation. Made just weeks before the release of his self-titled debut and only a few days short of his 23rd birthday, this recording reveals an eager, nervous version of Young&mdash;a version that existed briefly, soon gone in the flash of his subsequent solo success.</p><p>Not that he was uncomfortable on stage. Young had played to bigger crowds as part of Buffalo Springfield, whose success he gently mocks in between songs, scoffing at their huge amps and, as he puts it, \"ra-ta-ta-ta\" stage act. But he had yet to prove himself alone, and the weight of a public solo debut adds a little more quiver to his voice, a little more self-deprecation to his rambling stories.</p><p>In fact, Young was reportedly terrified, in part because he feared he didn't have enough material to sustain a full performance. Of the 13 songs included here, nearly half were previously recorded with Buffalo Springfield. To compensate, Young fills each gap with jittery, candid banter. \"Nothing I say up here is a lie,\" he claims with a stutter. \"I never ever have told a lie onstage.\" His true stories are consistently endearing, covering everything from taking \"diet pills\" to get through his previous life as a bookstore clerk, to writing Buffalo Springfield songs while stuck at a diner at 4 a.m., to learning what residuals are and buying a classic car with them.</p><p>The songs on Sugar Mountain are delivered with similar earnestness and vulnerability. After an introducer admits that the audience is larger than expected, Young offers a fragile version of \"On the Way Home\", his timid chords and cracking voice besting the speedier version found on the final Buffalo Springfield album, Last Time Around. Later, he sings \"The Loner\" in a bashful near-whisper, and the delicate guitar of \"If I Could Have Her Tonight\" alternates between approach and retreat. As things progress, Young's confidence grows, culminating in the \"The Old Laughing Lady\", which hits a rushing peak of forceful strums.</p><p>Musically, Sugar Mountain isn't Young's best live solo album. On that count, it's outshined by another recent archival release, the Massey Hall performance that happened three years later, and sounds much bolder and wider-ranging. But as a portrait of this ageless artist as a truly young man, Sugar Mountain is an invaluable document&mdash;and a pretty compelling one, too.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Marc Masters, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

His two compositions on the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album Déjà Vu, \"Helpless\" and \"Country Girl,\" returned him to the folk and country styles he had pursued before delving into the hard rock of Everybody Knows; two other singles, \"Sugar Mountain\" and \"Oh, Lonesome Me,\" also emphasized those roots. But \"Ohio,\" a CSNY single, rocked as hard as anything on the second album. After the Gold Rush was recorded with the aid of Nils Lofgren, a 17-year-old unknown whose piano was a major instrument, turning one of the few real rockers, \"Southern Man\" (which had unsparing protest lyrics typical of Phil Ochs), into a more stately effort than anything on the previous album and giving a classic tone to the title track, a mystical ballad that featured some of Young's most imaginative lyrics and became one of his most memorable songs. But much of After the Gold Rush consisted of country-folk love songs, which consolidated the audience Young had earned through his tours and recordings with CSNY; its dark yet hopeful tone matched the tenor of the times in 1970, making it one of the definitive singer/songwriter albums, and it has remained among Young's major achievements.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>In late 1970, Neil Young was coming down from a bustling stretch of touring with the immensely popular Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and had just released his third solo album, After the Goldrush. That album, lodged between the jammy country rock of 1969's Crazy Horse-aided Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and the hushed, hermetic folk of 1972's Harvest, found an ethereal and otherworldly middle ground for Young's rapidly developing songwriting voice. Live at the Cellar Door finds a solo Young just a few months after the release of After the Goldrush, playing a six-show stint at the tiny Washington D.C. club, running through a set heavy on the relatively new material from Gold Rush, but also getting into songs that wouldn't see album release for a few more records yet. It would have been impossible to gauge at the time of the performance, but the set list of Live at the Cellar Door is a non-stop string of what would become some of Young's many timeless classics, punctuated by the sound of the unthinkably small audience clapping politely as he wove through 15 magical compositions on spare acoustic guitar and occasional piano. Not just heavy on highlights, this is a rare live recording that lacks any duds or missteps at all. Apart from near-perfect selections from After the Goldrush like its fever-dream title track, the heartbreaking \"Birds,\" or the long look at growing up in \"Tell Me Why,\" Young debuts future hit \"Old Man\" as well as the On the Beach piano dirge \"See the Sky About to Rain.\" He also offers up a piano-only reading of \"Cinnamon Girl,\" announcing \"That's the first time I ever did that one on piano.\" Part of an ongoing archival series of key live dates from Young's massive career, Live at the Cellar Door includes snippets of the usual between-song banter, but a noticeably tired Young is more subdued even when making dry jokes. Sticking mostly to focused readings of his then-brand-new songs, he cultivates a somber mood, tapping into all the sorrow, wonder, and wistfulness of his early solo material as well as a few Buffalo Springfield tunes. These tracks feel much more like an album of alternate versions than a typical live recording. The intimacy and raw beauty of Live at the Cellar Door makes it not just a must for super fans, but a valuable companion piece to any of Young's early studio output.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Fred Thomas</strong></p><hr/><p>\"This song is about dope.\"</p><p>[\"Yeahhhhh,\" an audience member interjects.]</p><p>\"It's about what happens when you start getting high, and you find out that people you thought you knew, you don't know anymore, because they don't get high and you do.\"</p><p>That banter, dripping with irony and accompanied by shrieking scrapes of a piano's strings, forebodingly introduces the finale of the latest Neil Young archival release, Live at the Cellar Door. \"Flying on the Ground is Wrong\", one of Young's earliest songs, is a typically 60s piece of pharmacological us vs. them, a bittersweet song about how the squares just don't understand the new mind-expanding potential of drugs. But even if the audience didn't quite pick up on it on this December night, it's not exactly a celebration anymore for Young by 1970.</p><p>The first line of \"The Needle and the Damage Done\", which would start appearing in setlists the next month, is \"I caught you knocking at my cellar door.\" If the song is in fact referencing the famous, tiny D.C. club, it's most likely not about these 1970 shows, but rather the 1969 run with Crazy Horse and the worsening heroin addiction of guitarist Danny Whitten. But amidst an accumulation of dark, druggy vibes, this solo acoustic set catches Young in a bleak, hollow mood, rudely awoken from the hippie dream his audience still wants to believe.</p><p>If this all sounds familiar, it's because only seven weeks separated the Cellar Door shows and another Archives release: the superb January 1971 set at Toronto's Massey Hall Young freed from his vaults six years prior. A full seven of the 13 songs on Live at the Cellar Door also appear on the Massey Hall release, but these two shows still exist on opposing sides of a notable chapter break in Young's career and life. While Massey Hall looked forward to his commercial peak of Harvest, showcasing then-unheard songs such as \"Heart of Gold\" in their infancy, Live at the Cellar Door is mostly looking back to his previous two albums, After the Gold Rush and Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, and his late work with Buffalo Springfield.</p><p>Between the two shows, Young threw out his back on his ranch, picked up a painkiller habit, and started his turbulent relationship with actress Carrie Snodgrass (as chronicled in \"A Man Needs a Maid\" on Harvest). So the Massey and Cellar Door releases offer a sort of before-and-after experiment around this busy holiday break, even if the Live Archives chronology is getting so crowded in this era that this latest release had to be jimmied in as Volume 2.5.</p><p>But Live at the Cellar Door stands alone as an unexpected glimpse of Neil Young, piano man. Between songs, Young makes a long speech in praise of the venue's \"nine-foot Steinway,\" an instrument that provides as much of the accompaniment here as guitar. \"I've been playing piano for about...almost a year,\" he says, and whether that's a joke or not, his rudimentary keyboard approach mirrors the crude immediacy of his electric guitar work more than his subtle acoustic touch.</p><p>On the Buffalo Springfield track \"Expecting to Fly\"—an elegy to the 60s written before the decade was even finished—Young punctuates the chorus with loud discordant pounds that trail off into the silent club's darkness. The other piano reinvention, surprisingly, is \"Cinnamon Girl\", which even Neil obsessives probably have never heard in this arrangement. \"That's the first time I ever did that one on the piano,\" Neil says—and possibly the last time as well.</p><p>Paired with the equally gloomy Massey Hall, these sibling live sets show Young peeking over the edge of the 60s into the dark chasm of the next decade. It's frustrating that the Archives series continues to pace along this precipice instead of taking the plunge into the next rich stretch of Young's career: More material from the Harvest tour that begat the tormented Time Fades Away? The haunted/stoned Bottom Line show from 74? The short-lived Ducks? But even if it holds the most value for the Neil obsessives interested in the small differences, Live at Cellar Door provides another glimpse at a darkly formative time in his long career.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Ever since he started rumbling about releasing his archives some 20, 30 years ago -- it's been so long, it's hard to keep track of the specifics -- Neil Young talked about it as a mammoth box set, or perhaps a series of box sets each chronicling a different era in his career, comprised entirely of unreleased recordings, some live, some studio. It was an eagerly anticipated set, since everybody knew that he had scores of unreleased recordings in his vaults. Not just songs, but full albums that were scrapped at the last minute. He regularly tested out new songs on tour, sometimes rewriting them later, sometimes never releasing them on album. Some of his peers had similar habits -- Bob Dylan had a similar treasure trove of unreleased recordings -- but unlike Dylan, Young took an active interest in archiving this material himself. Given the amount of unreleased tapes, some patience was in order, but as the years stretched into decades, with Neil tinkering away, changing his mind, waiting for digital sound to get out of the dark ages, it was easy to wonder if the set would ever come out. When it did, it was not with a splash, as was the official Bob Dylan Bootleg Series, which was inaugurated as a triple-disc box in 1991. No, Young eased his way into the series by releasing a single disc called Live at the Fillmore East late in 2006.</p><p>Billed as the second volume of the \"Performance Series\" -- clearly, the numbers are assigned chronologically in order of recording, not release -- Live at the Fillmore East is not dissimilar to the subsequent entries in Dylan's bootleg series: it focuses on a specific, significant tour in Young's past. In this case, it's Neil's 1970 tour with Crazy Horse, supporting Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, his first record with the band. This was the original lineup of Crazy Horse featuring Danny Whitten, who would die tragically of a heroin overdose a mere two years later, making this a pivotal tour in Young's history. Whitten's ghost haunted Young & Crazy Horse throughout the '70s, particularly on his gloomy masterpiece Tonight's the Night, which featured a version of Whitten's great \"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown\" recorded during the group's stint at the Fillmore East in March 1970, which this album documents in a fuller fashion. That version of \"Downtown\" on Tonight's the Night hints at the power of this performance: simultaneously lithe and lumbering, it captures how Neil & Crazy Horse could sound at once unpredictable and inevitable. Part of that came from bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina, whose ramshackle rhythms were uniquely suited for Young, and pianist Jack Nitzsche also added texture to this tour, but this performance reveals how empathetic the interplay between Young and Whitten was. These guitarists weren't rivals; they interlocked and rode Talbot and Molina's steady, if occasionally misshapen, groove for as long as they could go -- and in the case of the 12-minute \"Down by the River\" and the 16-minute \"Cowgirl in the Sand,\" it was very long indeed, but they're never boring; they're hypnotic in their circular riffs and solos. Add to that a ragged, beautiful \"Winterlong\" and the sweet, loping \"Wonderin'\" -- performed here, but not released until Young revived and revamped it for his 1983 rockabilly record Everybody's Rockin' -- and this is truly a special performance and more than worthy beginning to the archives project.</p><p>That doesn't mean that this release is faultless. The main complaint that can be lodged against Live at the Fillmore East is that it's not a complete representation of a 1970 show. During this tour, Neil opened with an acoustic set and then had Crazy Horse come out for an electric set; the acoustic is not here, but most of the electric is, with only \"Cinnamon Girl\" absent -- and it's absent because there was not existing high-quality tape for it, unlike the rest of music that's featured here. So, it comes down to a matter of taste: for hardcore fans used to bootleg quality, they may lament the lack of a full show, but for those who want the best of this legendary stay at the Fillmore East in the best possible audio quality (including a DVD of the show, where the main program plays to photos of the band from the tour), that's what this set gives you. And in doing so, it gives a good indication that as Neil slowly rolls out the archives, he'll emphasize quality over completeness for better and for worse.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>The term \"solo artist\" is the most common misnomer in rock history, an insult to the oppressed and silent majority behind each legend's curtain. I'm talking about the sidemen, the backing bands, the producers, whose names are known only to the most ardent of sleeve-note scholars and biographers, and whose importance is recognized all too rarely. Elvis Presley had Scotty Moore and Sam Phillips, Bob Dylan had Al Kooper and Bob Johnston, David Bowie had Brian Eno and Mick Ronson, all integral parts of the sound that made each one famous, but doomed to never grace the marquee alongside the featured star.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Neil Young has run through a whole wardrobe of identities, each with its own critical supporting cast: a handful of country-rock bands with Stephen Stills, his seminal acoustic records with Nashville session supergroup the Stray Gators, tours and records with Booker T. & the MG's and Pearl Jam. But the group that Young returns to again and again is perhaps the unlikeliest, certainly not the most famous, and definitely not the most technically polished. Since 1969, Crazy Horse have been the three-piece engine that has fueled some of Young's most iconic work, and he has repaid them with the kind of equal billing that unsung sidemen so infrequently receive.</p><p>The proof is pictured on the cover of Live at the Fillmore East, where Young made the venue's sign-letter putter-upper do the extra work of spelling out his backing band's name alongside his own. At the time, Young was coming off an insanely successful record and tour with Crosby, Stills, and Nash, but he brushed them aside to play shows with the band that had backed him on his breakout solo statement Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere: Danny Whitten, Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina. Unknown, unpolished, even untalented (according to some), Crazy Horse were the complete antithesis of the polished and fashionable CSN, yet they helped Young achieve his apocalyptic garage-rock visions more vividly than the awkward compromises of the industry-assembled supergroup ever could.</p><p>Ironically, given Crazy Horse's oft-documented lack of technical ability, these 1970 shows took place at the time in rock history when improvisation was prized almost to the point of being a requirement. The Fillmore itself was a venue closely associated with the marathon jam sessions of bands like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers, and Miles Davis' fusion experiments actually shared the bill with Young & Crazy Horse. Young's contribution to this trend were his fraternal-twin epics \"Down By the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\", each with grand valleys of open space between brief scripted moments of verse and chorus. This release is dominated by those two songs, both of which gallivant past the 10-minute mark without ever growing stale, perfect demonstrations of the chemistry between frontman and supporters. The rhythm section of Talbot and Molina is anything but tight or flashy, but their dinosaur lope contains enough unpredictability to give the band a weird sort of swing, the bedrock upon which Danny Whitten and Neil Young stage their guitar conversations. The myth of Whitten has always been cloudy, his heroin habit having extinguished his much-lauded talent and, eventually, his life just as Crazy Horse started to gain a reputation, but it's on full display here, his ever-evolving rhythm parts combining with guest Jack Nitzsche's electric-piano to steer the jam sections' flow, giving Young plenty of room to lay down his alternately sad and angry note-choked leads.</p><p>Between these monumental performances, the set's other songs are almost like smoke breaks, brief bits of the heartfelt, ragged pop Young specialized in circa After the Goldrush. Relative rarity \"Winterlong\" is the gem of these shorter tracks, one of the sweetest songs in Young's electric repertoire, with a romantic aura made somehow more genuine by the hilariously broken harmonies. \"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown\" is the Horse's spotlight, Whitten showing that he was arguably a better, or at least more traditionally rock'n'roll, singer than his boss&mdash;a reminder that he essentially sings the lead part on \"Cinnamon Girl\", Young's biggest electric radio hit.</p><p>Yet as the first release of the long-promised purge of Young's extensive archives, the format of Live at the Fillmore East is condescendingly slight, selecting only highlights from the band's two-night/four-show run rather than providing complete, unabridged sets. For a band whose genius sprouts from imperfections and serendipitous mistakes, it's a disservice to deny Young's rabid fanbase unedited release of tapes that have been so long anticipated; they were recorded at the time for a live album that was later scrapped. But the few scraps they deemed worthy of release are nevertheless enough to justify the legendary status of Crazy Horse's early days, and explain why it was an easy call for Young to make the rare \"solo artist\" decision of treating his collaborators as equal partners.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>The second volume of Neil Young's long-promised, suddenly thriving Archives series is Live at Massey Hall, preserving a 1971 acoustic show at the Toronto venue. Where the first volume captured a portion of Neil's past that wasn't particularly well documented on record -- namely, the rampaging original Crazy Horse lineup in its 1970 prime -- this second installment may seem to cover familiar ground, at least to the outside observer who may assume that any solo acoustic Young must sound the same. That, of course, is not the case with an artist as mercurial and willful as Young, who was inarguably on a roll in 1971, coming off successes with Crazy Horse, Crosby, Stills & Nash, and his second solo record, 1970's After the Gold Rush. The concert chronicled on Live at Massey Hall finds Neil dipping into these recent successes for material, as he also airs material that would shortly find a home on 1972's Harvest in addition to playing songs that wouldn't surface until later in the decade -- \"Journey Through the Past\" and \"Love in Mind\" wound up on 1973's Time Fades Away, \"See the Sky About to Rain\" showed up on 1974's On the Beach -- and then there's two songs that never showed up on an official Neil Young album: the stomping hoedown \"Dance Dance Dance,\" which he gave to Crazy Horse, and \"Bad Fog of Loneliness,\" which gets its first release here. This is a remarkably rich set of songs, touching on nearly every aspect of Young's personality, whether it's his sweetness, his sensitivity, his loneliness, or even his often-neglected sense of fun. True, the latter only appears on \"Dance Dance Dance,\" but that comes as a welcome contrast to the stark sadness of \"See the Sky About to Rain.\" But even if \"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" retain their intense sense of menace when stripped of the winding guitar workouts of Crazy Horse, this concert isn't dominated by melancholy: it's a warm, giving affair, built upon lovely readings of \"Helpless,\" \"Tell Me Why,\" \"Old Man,\" and an early incarnation of \"A Man Needs a Maid\" (here played as a medley with \"Heart of Gold\") that removes the bombast of the Harvest arrangement, revealing the fragile, sweet song that lies underneath. While this concert isn't as freewheeling and rich as Young's studio albums of the early '70s -- each record had a distinctive character different from its predecessor, thanks in part to producer David Briggs, arranger/pianist Jack Nitzsche, and Young's supporting musicians, including Crazy Horse or the Stray Gators -- it nevertheless captures the essence of Neil Young the singer and songwriter at his artistic peak. That's the reason why this concert has been a legendary bootleg for nearly four decades and why its release 36 years after its recording is so special: it may not add an additional narrative to Neil Young's history, but it adds detail, color, and texture to a familiar chapter of his career, rendering it fresh once more. No wonder Briggs wanted to release this concert as an album between After the Gold Rush and Harvest: it not only holds its own against those classics, it enhances them. [Live at Massey Hall was also released as a two-disc set that contained a CD of the show and a DVD containing the same concert in high fidelity audio.]</p><p>&mdash; <stong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>There are few lonelier sounds than a Neil Young solo performance. Most pictures from his solitary jaunts show him surrounded by an army of guitars or hunched over a piano, trapped in the middle of a stark spotlight. Singing in a hushed and fragile voice, it almost sounds like he's locked in a bedroom rather than on a theater stage, and as such it's jarring to hear the rapt-silent crowd explode into applause between songs. Even the material speaks to solitude, as Young dusts off the corner of his songbook concerned with aging and the search for companionship, topics better suited for early-morning insomniac worry, not public performance.</p><p>Live at Massey Hall, the second live release in Neil Young's long-awaited and now briskly-paced Archives series, shows that this aspect of Young's persona had already matured in 1971, when the singer was only 26. Coming on the heels of last year's Live at Fillmore East, a disc of barnstorming distortion-pedal epics with his preferred partners Crazy Horse, this birthplace performance is representative of the abrupt downshifts that have marked Young's career. In the two years prior, he had released his loudest record to date, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, and participated in mega-ultra-supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, so of course the next step according to Neil Logic was to put the amps in storage and road-test an acoustic one-man show.</p><p>The January 1971 tour fell between Young's After the Gold Rush album, where his folk origins had started to seep back in amidst the overdrive of songs like \"Southern Man\", and 1972's Harvest, the warm country-rock crossover that won him his greatest commercial success. Many of the Harvest songs show up in this set still dripping from their compositional birth, and, stripped of their eventual Nashville pageantry, they're surprisingly morose. Without its plucky banjo and Linda Ronstadt/James Taylor backing vocals, \"Old Man\" shows itself to be more about the horror of growing old alone than country comfort, and the eventual mega-hit \"Heart of Gold\" is tossed off as the bridge to a stripped-bare version of \"A Man Needs a Maid\", one of Young's most painfully misanthropic songs.</p><p>Other new songs are no less glum, but make a case for Young as an underappreciated piano player. \"Love in Mind\", a minor-key lament from the criminally out-of-print Time Fades Away, is a hangover valentine that's teasingly short, while \"See the Sky About to Rain\", stripped down from its Rhodes-heavy On the Beach version, reveals itself as a neglected gem, featuring surprisingly complex key-tickling. Two songs that never made it to record show up as well, the mournful country tune \"Bad Fog of Loneliness\" (see what I mean?) and the silly throwaway \"Dance, Dance, Dance\", which appears to serve largely as a cheer-up send-off for Young's Toronto audience.</p><p>One of the strengths of Young's acoustic sets is that they carry a distinct identity from his electric work; they're not merely \"unplugged\" versions of his high-volume catalog, but a completely different mood designed to emphasize his wounded nasal voice and delicate finger-picking. Even so, the highlights of this particular set come from reinterpretations of electric hits, such as the reprises of Fillmore East showstoppers \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" and \"Down By the River\" recast as chilling murder ballads. The most effective makeover is given to the sometimes-maligned \"Ohio\", which in solo form (without the histrionics of CSNY's version) is less an angry screed than a perfect and still-relevant encapsulation of political helplessness, all half-finished thoughts and pervasive sadness.</p><p>All this gloom and doom was only going to build for Neil Young over the years following this tour; his new \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" foreshadowed the ensuing half-decade of addiction and death that would inspire some of his finest records. Live at Massey Hall catches Young divining that bleak future from the darkness of the crowd, caught alone at the microphone, a chilling example of why he was, in this particular guise, the 70s' best architect of lonesomeness.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Neil Young's most popular album, Harvest benefited from the delay in its release (it took 18 months to complete due to Young's back injury), which whetted his audience's appetite, the disintegration of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (Young's three erstwhile partners sang on the album, along with Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor), and most of all, a hit single. \"Heart of Gold,\" released a month before Harvest, was already in the Top 40 when the LP hit the stores, and it soon topped the charts. It's fair to say, too, that Young simply was all-pervasive by this time: \"Heart of Gold\" was succeeded at number one by \"A Horse with No Name\" by America, which was a Young soundalike record. But successful as Harvest was (and it was the best-selling album of 1972), it has suffered critically from reviewers who see it as an uneven album on which Young repeats himself. Certainly, Harvest employs a number of jarringly different styles. Much of it is country-tinged, with Young backed by a new group dubbed the Stray Gators who prominently feature steel guitarist Ben Keith, though there is also an acoustic track, a couple of electric guitar-drenched rock performances, and two songs on which Young is accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra. But the album does have an overall mood and an overall lyric content, and they conflict with each other: The mood is melancholic, but the songs mostly describe the longing for and fulfillment of new love. Young is perhaps most explicit about this on the controversial \"A Man Needs a Maid,\" which is often condemned as sexist by people judging it on the basis of its title. In fact, the song contrasts the fears of committing to a relationship with simply living alone and hiring help, and it contains some of Young's most autobiographical writing. Unfortunately, like \"There's a World,\" the song is engulfed in a portentous orchestration. Over and over, Young sings of the need for love in such songs as \"Out on the Weekend,\" \"Heart of Gold,\" and \"Old Man\" (a Top 40 hit), and the songs are unusually melodic and accessible. The rock numbers, \"Are You Ready for the Country\" and \"Alabama,\" are in Young's familiar style and unremarkable, and \"There's a World\" and \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\" are the most ponderous and overdone Young songs since \"The Last Trip to Tulsa.\" But the love songs and the harrowing portrait of a friend's descent into heroin addiction, \"The Needle and the Damage Done,\" remain among Young's most affecting and memorable songs.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Anyone who has followed Neil Young's career knows enough not to expect a simple evening of mellow good times when they see him in concert, but in 1973, when Young hit the road after Harvest had confirmed his status as a first-echelon rock star, that knowledge wasn't nearly as common as it is today. Young's natural inclinations to travel against the current of audience expectations were amplified by a stormy relationship between himself and his touring band, as well as the devastating death of guitarist Danny Whitten, who died of a drug overdose shortly after being given his pink slip during the first phase of tour rehearsals. The shows that followed turned into a nightly exorcism of Young's rage and guilt, as well as a battle between himself and an audience who, expecting to hear \"Old Man\" and \"Heart of Gold,\" didn't know what to make of the electric assault they witnessed. All the more remarkably, Young brought along a mobile recording truck to capture the tour on tape for a live album and the result, Time Fades Away, was a ragged musical parade of bad karma and road craziness, opening with Young bellowing \"14 junkies, too weak to work\" on the title cut, and closing with \"Last Dance,\" in which he tells his fans \"you can live your own life\" with all the optimism of a man on the deck of a sinking ship. While critics and fans were not kind to Time Fades Away upon first release, decades later it sounds very much of a piece with Tonight's the Night and On the Beach, albums that explored the troubled zeitgeist of America in the mid-'70s in a way few rockers had the courage to face. If the performances are often loose and ragged, they're also brimming with emotional force, and despite the dashed hopes of \"Yonder Stands the Sinner\" and \"Last Dance,\" \"Don't Be Denied\" is a moving remembrance of Young's childhood and what music has meant to him, and it's one of the most powerful performances Young ever committed to vinyl. Few rockers have been as willing as Young to lay themselves bare before their audience, and Time Fades Away ranks with the bravest and most painfully honest albums of his career -- like the tequila Young was drinking on that tour, it isn't for everyone, but you may be surprised by its powerful effects.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p><hr/><p>Neil Young boasted of steering his career into \"the ditch\" in the early 1970s, choosing to make sad, lonely, difficult records in the wake of Harvest's wide success. The \"Ditch Trilogy\" (as Young enthusiasts dubbed it) of Time Fades Away, Tonight's the Night, and On the Beach marks his creative peak—yet for decades, this era was neglected and incomplete. On the Beach only made it to CD in 2003, and Time Fades Away was never reissued digitally.Thanks to the vinyl revival, the trio is finally available. Rereleased initially as a pricey Record Store Day box set, and now as individual LPs, the \"Ditch Trilogy\" records—plus its sunnier epilogue, Zuma—are back in print for the first time since their original releases. So while On the Beach and Tonight's the Night are well-established masterpieces, now's the time to consider the on-ramp and the off-ramp to the Ditch, and understand how Young entered that dark spiral and how he escaped it.</p><p>Time Fades Away is the album Neil Young didn't want us to hear; in several interviews over the years, he's bluntly referred to it as his \"worst album.\" In Waging Heavy Peace, Young's 2012 memoir, the 1973 live album is mentioned exactly twice, which is approximately 1,000 times fewer than his electric Lincoln and his Pono music service. Even when major missing pieces of his '70s catalog were patched in 2003, Time Fades Away was left to rot in the archives. Several theories have circulated to explain the conspicuous snub, most often returning to the cursed fog that hung over Young's 1973 tour. Originally, the band was supposed to include Danny Whitten, Neil's guitar foil in Crazy Horse—but, fighting drug addiction and alcoholism, Whitten couldn't hack it at rehearsals in fall 1972, and he was fired and sent back to Los Angeles. That same night, he was found dead from an overdose of alcohol and Valium. Whitten's death cast a shadow over the tour, which started the following January and wormed its way across the United States in a rigorous 62 shows in 90 days.The stories from the tour, as regaled in Young biographies, are like a nightmare version of Almost Famous, replete with drug indulgences, money arguments, audience riots, medical issues, and technical problems. Two-thirds of the way through, Neil's vocal cords were shot, leading to show cancellations and inclusion of David Crosby and Graham Nash, to no great help. Young's band the Stray Gators, the murderer's row of session musicians from Harvest, didn't translate to basketball arenas; drummer Kenny Buttrey had the worst time of it, with Young asking him to play louder and louder until he literally bled on his drums. Legendary producer and arranger Jack Nitzsche, playing piano, self-medicated his stage fright with alcohol; for his own part, Young spent the tour chugging tequila and trying out a new Gibson Flying V guitar instead of his totemic Old Black, his dissatisfaction with the sound leading to endless soundchecks and after-show spats. So this wasn't exactly the tour you'd want to commemorate for eternity with a live album—but at least initially, Young was perversely excited to reflect its chaos, and left the recording mostly free of the overdubs that glossed many live albums of the era. \"Money hassles among everyone concerned ruined this tour and record for me, but I released it anyway so you folks could see what could happen if you lose it for a while,\" Young wrote in the liner notes of 1977's Decade.</p><p>But in retrospect, he was too harsh. The Stray Gators were one of Young's most interesting bands: they were fragile, straining, and desperate. One could easily see where their heavier material, such as \"Yonder Stands the Sinner\" and \"Last Dance,\" would have fit Whitten-era Crazy Horse. Here, pedal steel wizard Ben Keith levels up from a classy hired hand on Harvest to assume Whitten's role, his instrument providing wobbly, intoxicated howls that amplify the haunted mood. Nitzsche plays a deceptively clunky piano that turns \"Time Fades Away\" into a chicken-wire saloon and creeps with tinkling anxiety around the edges of \"Last Dance.\" When Crosby and Nash show up, they create an alternate-dimension CSNY that uses their harmonies as a weapon instead of a balm, with Young and Crosby's \"Yonder Stands the Sinner\" choruses particularly deranged.</p><p>Coming on the heels of the slick Harvest, Time Fades Away was a crucial swerve for Young, and it established the proudly flawed aesthetic that has kept his work immediate and powerful for decades. These are weary, acidic songs about the hollowness of stardom—recording them during a tour from hell is an asset, not a flaw. Even the crowd noise between songs heightens the despair—blissful, oblivious applause from an audience too remote to see Young's naked pain. Songs previously lost on Time Fades Away are key parts of Young's story. \"Don't Be Denied\" is one of Young's best autobiographical songs, wistfully telling the story of his Canadian childhood through Buffalo Springfield's early days. \"L.A.\" is a wonderfully cynical kiss-off to the city where that band found stardom, a land of dreams beset by earthquakes, traffic, and smog.</p><p>Because Zuma was packaged with the trilogy for the Record Store Day vinyl box set, there's been some recent chatter of a \"Ditch quadrilogy.\" But Zuma is a poor fit with the other three; it's a record made on a beach instead of On the Beach, a happy reunion and fresh beginning for Crazy Horse, and a goofy boys' club hangout released only five months after Tonight's the Night's tortured slog. It hits the reset button in many ways—most literally with its opener, \"Don't Cry No Tears,\" which recycles the melody from \"I Wonder,\" one of Young's first recorded works with his high school band, the Squires. It also marked Young's decision to reform Crazy Horse for the first time since Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, with new guitarist Frank \"Poncho\" Sampedro filling the big rhythm guitar shoes of Danny Whitten. That Young could even stomach replacing Whitten, two years after his death, signaled that the session in Malibu would be one of recovery and rebirth. That period was particularly debauched, with the recently divorced Young and his bandmates enjoyed the company of California girls and Colombian powder, and the party carried over into the \"studio\" (essentially just a room in producer David Briggs' rental house). There, the new Crazy Horse got to know each other over some hastily written material, simplified to work with Poncho's rudimentary guitar. This lackadaisical formula explains the uneven nature of Zuma, which is equally filled with classics and duds. \"Cortez the Killer\" and \"Danger Bird\" are two triumphantly moody, electric epics—lesser cousins to the \"Down by the River\"-style sprees of the first Crazy Horse, but still spacious opportunities for Young to revive his trademark lacerating guitar tone. It's here that the sludgy Crazy Horse known today takes shape: the trade-out of the communicative Whitten for Sampedro's simpler style creates that blunt sound. The rhythm section of Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina lurches menacingly through \"Cortez\" and \"Danger Bird,\" and Sampedro's blocky guitar caddies for Young's lengthy soloing.The album's two other highlights revive a breezy, poppy Young that had been missing since After the Gold Rush. \"Don't Cry No Tears,\" is simple twangy country-rock well in the Horse's wheelhouse, gilded with innocent backing harmonies. \"Barstool Blues,\" despite being a fairly shameless rip of \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,\" is a convincing and catchy depiction of drunken euphoria—and a pretty accurate portrait of Zuma's making. On the less lovable side of the endless party, \"Stupid Girl\" is nowhere near good enough to justify its casual misogyny and title swipe from the Rolling Stones, and \"Drive Back\" is barely a song beneath its mighty riff and creepy piano. Leftovers tossed in from Homegrown (\"Pardon My Heart\") and the aborted second CSNY record (\"Through My Sails\") don't quite fit the mood, presaging the less cohesive and spottier records over the rest of Young's decade.</p><p>Still, if Zuma is an epilogue to the Ditch Trilogy, it's also a prologue to the rest of Young's career, kicking off his fickle, impulsive zig-zagging between genres and volume levels. That restlessness would keep Young vital long after his peers faded&mdash;and it can be traced all the way back to the stoned sunsets of Malibu, where Young decided to cry no more tears and move onward down the road, swerving all the way.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Following the 1973 Time Fades Away tour, Neil Young wrote and recorded an Irish wake of a record called Tonight's the Night and went on the road drunkenly playing its songs to uncomprehending listeners and hostile reviewers. Reprise rejected the record, and Young went right back and made On the Beach, which shares some of the ragged style of its two predecessors. But where Time was embattled and Tonight mournful, <i>On the Beach</i> was savage and, ultimately, triumphant. \"I'm a vampire, babe,\" Young sang, and he proceeded to take bites out of various subjects: threatening the lives of the stars who lived in L.A.'s Laurel Canyon (\"Revolution Blues\"); answering back to Lynyrd Skynyrd, whose \"Sweet Home Alabama\" had taken him to task for his criticisms of the South in \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama\" (\"Walk On\"); and rejecting the critics (\"Ambulance Blues\"). But the barbs were mixed with humor and even affection, as Young seemed to be emerging from the grief and self-abuse that had plagued him for two years. But the album was so spare and under-produced, its lyrics so harrowing, that it was easy to miss Young's conclusion: he was saying goodbye to despair, not being overwhelmed by it.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p><hr/><p>There are few musical artists who need the old canonization speech less than Neil Young.  With his reputation preserved amongst us youngsters as the Godfather of Grunge (apparently based on little more than a predilection towards flannel), he's already known by all as the hip great-uncle amidst the Woodstock era's senile grandparents.  Still, attention must be paid to the most impressive feat of Young's career: an all-but-perfect streak of very good-to-excellent albums that spanned an incredible, and unparalleled, eleven years. To put it another way, from 1969-1979, Neil Young was rock's Joe Dimaggio. Which makes it especially cruel that, for years afterward, Neil's eccentric skepticism about the auditory worth of the compact disc format kept many of those albums out-of-print. So it's somewhat ironic that now, in the dying days of the digital disc, Reprise Records has finally convinced their stubborn client to allow for patching up most of these holes, rescuing four albums from obscurity and bootleggers.</p><p>Fancy remastering, fancy packaging: who cares?  I can finally retire four crackly vinyls to wall-decoration duty.The most criminal omission by a long shot was On the Beach, the 1974 disc that represented Young's last ramp-up before his masterpiece, Tonight's the Night.  Recorded with help from The Band's crack rhythm section and colorful multi-instrumentalist hick Rusty Kershaw, On the Beach is one of the few from Young's catalog that doesn't land easily on either his country or hard-rock piles.  Three song titles with the word \"blues\" give you an idea of the mood, but hardly prepare you for the bleak anger of \"Revolution Blues\" or \"For the Turnstiles\", post-apocalyptic visions as eerie as any of 28 Days Later's scenic pans. The real engine of the album's brilliance, though, is the trio of slow, long, lonely hotel room folk songs that closes out the album, peaking with Neil's \"Desolation Row\", \"Ambulance Blues.\"  To hear them is to know that Jason Molina goes to bed each night caressing a copy of this record.</p><p>The stark tone of On the Beach was only carried over to one track from 1977's American Stars 'n' Bars, the creepily lo-fi \"Will to Love\".  What fills the remainder of the album is a sort of buffet-style Neil Young, offering up choice leftovers from various failed projects of the era.  The peak, of course, is \"Like a Hurricane\", perhaps one of the finest examples of Neil's willfully untechnical guit-hartic playing style, a chord progression that induces string-popping frenzy in his live shows to this day. But also making appearances are Skynyrd Neil, slashing country-rock lines through \"Bite the Bullet\" and Farm Aid favorite \"Homegrown\", and Sensitive Poet Neil, revisiting Harvest seasoning     with \"Hey Babe\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\".</p><p>Unfortunately, reclaiming that Harvest mood is what chokes the majority of Hawks & Doves,     notable for being the dashed-off post-Rust Never Sleeps album that breaks his streak of excellence, and not much more. Other than faux-traditionals \"The Old Homestead\" and \"Captain Kennedy\", this 1980     release captures an uncharacteristically tentative Neil, clearly unsure of whether to develop quirky singalongs like \"Lost in Space\" or plastic soul like \"Staying Power\" (an early harbinger of his recent unbecoming Motown romanticism).

		"review": "<p>Following the 1973 Time Fades Away tour, Neil Young wrote and recorded an Irish wake of a record called Tonight's the Night and went on the road drunkenly playing its songs to uncomprehending listeners and hostile reviewers. Reprise rejected the record, and Young went right back and made On the Beach, which shares some of the ragged style of its two predecessors. But where Time was embattled and Tonight mournful, <i>On the Beach</i> was savage and, ultimately, triumphant. \"I'm a vampire, babe,\" Young sang, and he proceeded to take bites out of various subjects: threatening the lives of the stars who lived in L.A.'s Laurel Canyon (\"Revolution Blues\"); answering back to Lynyrd Skynyrd, whose \"Sweet Home Alabama\" had taken him to task for his criticisms of the South in \"Southern Man\" and \"Alabama\" (\"Walk On\"); and rejecting the critics (\"Ambulance Blues\"). But the barbs were mixed with humor and even affection, as Young seemed to be emerging from the grief and self-abuse that had plagued him for two years. But the album was so spare and under-produced, its lyrics so harrowing, that it was easy to miss Young's conclusion: he was saying goodbye to despair, not being overwhelmed by it.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p><hr/><p>There are few musical artists who need the old canonization speech less than Neil Young. With his reputation preserved amongst us youngsters as the Godfather of Grunge (apparently based on little more than a predilection towards flannel), he's already known by all as the hip great-uncle amidst the Woodstock era's senile grandparents.  Still, attention must be paid to the most impressive feat of Young's career: an all-but-perfect streak of very good-to-excellent albums that spanned an incredible, and unparalleled, eleven years. To put it another way, from 1969-1979, Neil Young was rock's Joe Dimaggio. Which makes it especially cruel that, for years afterward, Neil's eccentric skepticism about the auditory worth of the compact disc format kept many of those albums out-of-print. So it's somewhat ironic that now, in the dying days of the digital disc, Reprise Records has finally convinced their stubborn client to allow for patching up most of these holes, rescuing four albums from obscurity and bootleggers.</p><p>Fancy remastering, fancy packaging: who cares?  I can finally retire four crackly vinyls to wall-decoration duty.The most criminal omission by a long shot was On the Beach, the 1974 disc that represented Young's last ramp-up before his masterpiece, Tonight's the Night.  Recorded with help from The Band's crack rhythm section and colorful multi-instrumentalist hick Rusty Kershaw, On the Beach is one of the few from Young's catalog that doesn't land easily on either his country or hard-rock piles.  Three song titles with the word \"blues\" give you an idea of the mood, but hardly prepare you for the bleak anger of \"Revolution Blues\" or \"For the Turnstiles\", post-apocalyptic visions as eerie as any of 28 Days Later's scenic pans. The real engine of the album's brilliance, though, is the trio of slow, long, lonely hotel room folk songs that closes out the album, peaking with Neil's \"Desolation Row\", \"Ambulance Blues.\"  To hear them is to know that Jason Molina goes to bed each night caressing a copy of this record.</p><p>The stark tone of On the Beach was only carried over to one track from 1977's American Stars 'n' Bars, the creepily lo-fi \"Will to Love\".  What fills the remainder of the album is a sort of buffet-style Neil Young, offering up choice leftovers from various failed projects of the era.  The peak, of course, is \"Like a Hurricane\", perhaps one of the finest examples of Neil's willfully untechnical guit-hartic playing style, a chord progression that induces string-popping frenzy in his live shows to this day. But also making appearances are Skynyrd Neil, slashing country-rock lines through \"Bite the Bullet\" and Farm Aid favorite \"Homegrown\", and Sensitive Poet Neil, revisiting Harvest seasoning with \"Hey Babe\" and \"Star of Bethlehem\".</p><p>Unfortunately, reclaiming that Harvest mood is what chokes the majority of Hawks & Doves, notable for being the dashed-off post-Rust Never Sleeps album that breaks his streak of excellence, and not much more. Other than faux-traditionals \"The Old Homestead\" and \"Captain Kennedy\", this 1980 release captures an uncharacteristically tentative Neil, clearly unsure of whether to develop quirky singalongs like \"Lost in Space\" or plastic soul like \"Staying Power\" (an early harbinger of his recent unbecoming Motown romanticism). Young can't even seem to stay on task thematically here, sequencing the patronizing \"Union Man\" before \"Comin' Apart at Every Nail\"'s fanfare for the working man. Consider that the title track is brimful of pro-American nationalism from the Canadian-born songwriter, and you've got a good idea of just how confusing an effort Hawks & Doves can be.</p><p>But confusion was to be the name of the game for Young in the 1980s, a period celebrated for his principled resistance to record company pigeon-holing, but very, very rarely actually listened to.

		"review": "<p>Written and recorded in 1973 shortly after the death of roadie Bruce Berry, Neil Young's second close associate to die of a heroin overdose in six months (the first was Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten), Tonight's the Night was Young's musical expression of grief, combined with his rejection of the stardom he had achieved in the late '60s and early '70s. The title track, performed twice, was a direct narrative about Berry: \"Bruce Berry was a working man/He used to load that Econoline van.\" Whitten was heard singing \"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown,\" a live track recorded years earlier. Elsewhere, Young frequently referred to drug use and used phrases that might have described his friends, such as the chorus of \"Tired Eyes,\" \"He tried to do his best, but he could not.\" Performing with the remains of Crazy Horse, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina, along with Nils Lofgren (guitar and piano) and Ben Keith (steel guitar), Young performed in the ragged manner familiar from Time Fades Away -- his voice was often hoarse and he strained to reach high notes, while the playing was loose, with mistakes and shifting tempos. But the style worked perfectly for the material, emphasizing the emotional tone of Young's mourning and contrasting with the polished sound of CSNY and Harvest that Young also disparaged. He remained unimpressed with his commercial success, noting in \"World on a String,\" \"The world on a string/Doesn't mean anything.\" In \"Roll Another Number,\" he said he was \"a million miles away/From that helicopter day\" when he and CSN had played Woodstock. And in \"Albuquerque,\" he said he had been \"starvin' to be alone/Independent from the scene that I've known\" and spoke of his desire to \"find somewhere where they don't care who I am.\" Songs like \"Speakin' Out\" and \"New Mama\" seemed to find some hope in family life, but Tonight's the Night did not offer solutions to the personal and professional problems it posed. It was the work of a man trying to turn his torment into art and doing so unflinchingly. Depending on which story you believe, Reprise Records rejected it or Young withdrew it from its scheduled release at the start of 1974 after touring with the material in the U.S. and Europe. In 1975, after a massive CSNY tour, Young at the last minute dumped a newly recorded album and finally put Tonight's the Night out instead. Though it did not become one of his bigger commercial successes, the album immediately was recognized as a unique masterpiece by critics, and it has continued to be ranked as one of the greatest rock & roll albums ever made.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p><hr/><p>In February 1972, Neil Young put out an album called Harvest and it became massive, going platinum and becoming the best-selling album of the year. In addition to changing Young's position in the marketplace, the album's runaway success made a mark on record shopping for years to come. Anyone who went to a store before the vinyl revival began in earnest can tell you that used copies of Harvest were utterly ubiquitous—like Cat Stevens' Teaser and the Firecat and Carole King's Tapestry, there was seemingly no thrift shop or garage sale without one. With Harvest, Young built on the commercial breakthrough of his work with Crosby, Stills, and Nash, mixing two sounds beloved by aging baby boomers—rootsy country-rock and intimate singer/songwriter folk. Harvest was the right record for this weird, post-‘60s moment, and a shaggy Canadian singer-songwriter with the shaky voice was suddenly something approaching a pop star.Harvest had its share of wistful and breezy songs, but a number on the second side called \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" was a sign of things to come. It was a song, in part, about guitarist, singer, and songwriter Danny Whitten, Young's friend and a member of his frequent backing band, Crazy Horse, specifically Whitten's addiction to heroin. \"The Needle and the Damage Done,\" recorded live in concert and solo, set a template for a certain kind of song about drug abuse: It's beautiful, elegiac, precise—a focused lament written with a great deal of craft, like Elliott Smith's \"Needle in the Hay\" or U2's \"Running to Stand Still.\"</p><p>While he always excelled at this style, Young's approach to songwriting was about to shift drastically. \"‘Heart of Gold' put me in the middle of the road,\" he famously wrote of Harvest's big single in the liner notes to his 1977 collection Decade, perhaps thinking of his album in the bins next to those by massive sellers by Cat Stevens and Carole King. \"Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch.\" Tonight's the Night, a noisy, harrowing scrape along the guardrail that sends sparks flying upward, was Young's most moving dispatch from his chosen place. As summer turned to fall in 1973, 18 months after Harvest hit stores, Neil Young was 27 years old. He was learning that bad things can start to happen when you reach your late twenties, especially when you're drinking too much and doing too many drugs and are hanging around people who do the same. Your late twenties is when you might find that certain people who once seemed like \"they like to party\" are going much further, and the situation is getting dangerous. Bodies that seemed indestructible in youth start to give out; good times suddenly aren't so good anymore.</p><p>In August of '73, when Young started the sessions that produced the bulk of Tonight's the Night, he found himself in the heart of such a scene, and the center could not hold.Two events in the previous 10 months had shaken Young to his core, and they shaped how this album came to be and how it was heard. In November 1972, Young was rehearsing the band he dubbed the Stray Gators to take them on tour in support of Harvest. Whitten was asked to join the group but it quickly became clear that his addiction had advanced to the point where playing shows was impossible, so Young fired him and gave him $50 and a plane ticket back to Los Angeles. Whitten died of an overdose of valium and alcohol within a day, and Young was overcome with guilt about his friend's death. In June of '73, two months before the Tonight's the Night sessions, Bruce Berry, a roadie for Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young and beloved member of Young's particular L.A. scene, died of an overdose of heroin. So Tonight's the Night comes freighted with a certain amount of legend, and people generally encounter it now through the lens of 40 years of rock writing.</p><p>If you've read enough about music, you've read the above \"ditch\" comment, and you'll have it somewhere in your mind the first time you press \"play\" or lower the turntable arm. The general understanding on Tonight's the Night is that it's dark, it's depressing, a record about loss and destruction and the end. If you listen to it knowing these things, you're in for a surprise. Because it is those things, but it's also so much more. Tonight's the Night is shocking the first time you hear it because for a record on the receiving end of so much first-generation rock criticism focusing on its sorrow and grief, it often sounds like a raucous party being thrown by a bunch of lovable knuckleheads having the time of their life.After the repetition of the opening \"tonight's the night\" refrain on the opening title track, the first two words on the album are \"Bruce Berry,\" and the album's connection to Young's deceased friend go deeper.</p><p>In August '73, after some sessions at the L.A.'s Sunset Sound, Young decided a proper studio wasn't the right setting for the album he had in mind. So Young's producer David Briggs had the idea to record at a Studio Instrument Rentals, which was started by Bruce Berry and his brother Ken. In addition to renting equipment, S.I.R. had a small practice space in the back with an elevated stage. A mobile recording truck was parked behind the building and a hole was knocked in the wall to run cable to the truck. Young's band now consisted of the Crazy Horse rhythm section of Billy Talbot on bass and Ralph Molina on drums, young guitarist and sometime Crazy Horse member Nils Lofgren, and steel guitar player Ben Keith, who had worked with Young in Nashville on Harvest. Over the course of a month, they'd assemble in the evening with Briggs at S.I.R. to drink and do drugs and play pool and shoot the shit until they were ready to climb onstage and make music. The Tonight's the Night songs recorded in the practice space were cut live in this fashion, with no overdubs and minimal editing, and the album itself is one of the most sonically raw albums ever released by a major artist. The band is loose and well-oiled. At times Young is too close or too far away from the microphone, and his voice is often straining at the upper end of his range. Young was recording the month after Steely Dan had released Countdown to Ecstasy, and the rich possibilities of the recording studio were reaching a zenith, but he was recording in a dimly-lit room with a drunk band in the back of a retail store, noisily banging into microphone stands on takes that would eventually be used on an album by a label owned by Warner Brothers. </p><p>This off-the-cuff feel defines the album. Working with Young, producer David Briggs was about capturing performances, not making records. The album begins with a ghostly bit of tinkling piano and guitar that sounds like a brief warm-up, the kind of thing that would be cut from any record without a second thought. But here it's perfect, lending the kind of \"here we go!\" feeling of the best album-openers. Young's words on Berry are personal and almost uncomfortably specific, basically saying, \"Here was this man; here is what he did, and now he's gone.\" Young talks about Berry picking up Young's guitar and singing late at night after gigs when everyone was gone, and being moved deeply by a voice that was \"as real as the day was long.\" That kind of \"realness\" is the animating idea of this album. The meticulous craftsmanship that had carried Young to the top with Harvest had no place here; now it was time to make some noise. Tonight's the Night is an album not so much about death as about mourning. And while we might like to think of mourning as a dignified pursuit grounded in ritual—a black veil, food at the door, loved ones at beck and call—the truth is that mourning can be messy and out of control and it can sometimes look like something else entirely. Sometimes mourning can even look like a macabre celebration, embracing life with one arm while the black figure of death is curled inside the other. That's where Young and his band found themselves during this period. \"Lookout Joe,\" one of a couple of songs on Tonight's the Night recorded in December '72, has a couplet that conveys the record's reckless spirit perfectly: \"Remember Bill from up on the hill?/A Cadillac put a hole in his arm/But old Bill, he's up there still/Havin' a ball rollin' to the bottom.\"A few songs seem at first to exist more for the people playing them than the listener, but that conspiratorial sense of community between the musicians turns out to be a huge part of the appeal. \"Speakin' Out\" is the sound of a band feeling their way through the most basic chord changes possible, the kind of structure even the most intoxicated and most damaged musician could handle with no problem. The meaning lies in hearing these people in this room playing together, the feeling they conjure by the presence, and not in Young's lines like \"I went to the movie the other night/The plot was groovy, it was out of sight.\" Tonight's the Night's beauty lies in its imperfections. \"Mellow My Mind\" has a similarly unfinished feel, but the strain of Young's voice is so palpable, every half-baked couplet swollen with ache, that it's almost unbearably affecting.\"Roll Another Number (For the Road)\" is a song about the end of a long night of incapacitating inebriation performed by a band that sounds like they've just experienced a long night of incapacitating inebriation.</p><p>Young has always been, on one level, of the hippie generation's true believers&mdash;he did, after all, title the first volume of his memoir Waging Heavy Peace. But he can just as often be repelled by the soft-headedness of the movement. \"I'm not goin' back to Woodstock for a while,\" he sings on \"Roll Another Number,\" explaining that he's \"a million miles away/From that helicopter day.\" The road so many of his generation had taken led him here, drunk on a dark stage singing songs about death and loss to nobody. Sometimes songs are knocked together and passed around, something to be used as much as something performed. And for songs like these, you grab whatever's at hand. Such a loose and generous approach led Young to a place where he could lift the melody of a song someone else had written wholesale and call his creation \"Borrowed Tune\" without shame or apology. \"I'm singing my borrowed tune, I took from the Rolling Stones/Alone in this empty room, too wasted to write my own,\" he sings over minimal piano, voicing a melody first found on the Jagger/Richards composition \"Lady Jane.\" Young's Stones' interpolation and blues changes suggest that the building blocks of music belong to us all, and we should take what we need and turn the raw material into a new expression. That feeling, of the possibility of transformation, extends to the record as a whole. There are so many loose ends, frayed connections, and smudgy borders, no single song has any one specific meaning.</p><p>Listening to the album becomes an act of authorship, as its slurred words and pugnacious spirit are mapped onto your own life. Ben Keith's pedal steel guitar playing is often astonishing in its beauty, which provides a layer of tension with the often-sloppy playing and rough sonics. In Keith's hands, the pedal steel imbues every song with a symphonic grandeur, and also a feeling of life-affirming dignity. His show-stopping number here is the gorgeous ballad \"Albuquerque.\" While Young sings about disappearing western landscape (\"So I'll stop when I can/Find some fried eggs and country ham/I'll find somewhere/Where they don't care who I am\"), Keith conjures up huge, rich clouds of notes. No matter what else is happening on a given song, how loud the party gets, Keith lends a note of pathos, ensuring that the undercurrent of grief remains. Whitten's loss is honored by the inclusion of \"(Come on Baby, Let's Go) Downtown,\" a song he composed with Young and sings, heard here on a version recorded at a 1970 Neil Young and Crazy Horse gig. That \"Downtown\" wound up on Tonight's the Night is kind of a twisted joke, because the song itself, despite being a joyous rave-up, is actually about scoring heroin. Whitten's death seems impossible when this song crackles with so much life. It's both a celebration and a lament. Hearing their voices in unison on the chorus is a kind of prayer, two music lifers realizing in a moment the power of what they could do together. And the album as a whole takes this idea and extends it outward, first to Young's fellow musicians, and then to us.</p><p>The three albums later grouped together as \"The Ditch Trilogy\" include the 1973 live album Time Fades Away (culled from the shows Whitten had hoped to play on) and 1974's On the Beach. They are very different documents bound together by the force of Young's vision. Though Tonight's the Night was recorded before On the Beach, it wouldn't be released for another two years. This turned out to be to the album's advantage, because its final presentation highlighted the fact that it was snapshot of a moment in time, and gave Young the opportunity to inflate its myth.When it finally emerged, it came inside one of rock's greatest sleeves, a spooky high contrast black-and-white photo of Young printed on blotter paper. On the LP itself, the Reprise label, usually tan, was black, and there were cryptic carvings in the run-out groove, \"Hello Waterface\" in the A-side and \"Goodbye Waterface\" on the B. An insert included with album features notes from Young with a sort of apology (\"I'm sorry. You don't know these people. This means nothing to you.\") and a lengthy article about Young written in Dutch. The article, as it turns out, was a harsh pan of a show from Young's tour following the completion of the Tonight's the Night material, undertaken a year and a half before the album's release. These shows, which are now the stuff of legend, were theatrical. \"The stage set was very strange,\" reads a translation of the liner notes. \"At the back a large palm tree; next to the piano and loudspeakers were hanging all sorts of women's boots and there were hubcaps laid all around. We were in total darkness when Neil and his band—Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren, Ralph Molina & Billy Talbot took the stage and slowly began playing the 1st number ‘Tonight's the Night.' The sound was miserable, the band's coordination was miserable and Neil's piano and singing were miserable.\" During these shows, Young would often mix songs with long rants about his deceased friends. He was toying with his place in the entertainment machine, trying to figure out how to sneak these heavier feelings in. His \"Miami Beach\" routine was a way of externalizing the artifice of your typical music performance to make the real feelings at the core that much more intense. It was a rock show designed to feel like a seance, a way of communing with the dead. But in the end, Tonight's the Night is really a record about life. Like a drunk at the end of a long night or a boxer barely on their feet, the record staggers, stumbles, and lunges forward; it's prevailing mode is \"unsteady.\" Nothing lands where it should, and it feels like it could collapse at any moment. But while a lurching gait can be a marker of damage or dysfunction, it can also be a sign of defiance. Because some force, whether it's from outside or it's something you bring on yourself, is trying to cripple you. But guess what: you're still standing.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Richardson, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

They revealed that the songs had been cut at four different sessions dating back to 1974. But even without such documentation, it would have been easy to tell that the album was a stylistic hodgepodge, its first side consisting of country-tinged material featuring steel guitar and fiddle, plus backup vocals from Linda Ronstadt and the then-unknown Nicolette Larson, while the four songs on the second side varied from acoustic solo numbers like \"Will to Love\" to raging rockers such as \"Like a Hurricane.\" Just as apparent was the album's unevenness: side one consisted of lightweight compositions, while side two had more ambitious ones, with \"Will to Love,\" for example, extending the romantic metaphor of a salmon swimming upstream across seven minutes. The album's saving grace was \"Like a Hurricane,\" one of Young's classic hard rock songs and guitar workouts, and a perennial concert favorite. Without it, American Stars 'n Bars would have been one of Young's least memorable albums, and since it turned up the following year on the compilation Decade, the LP was rendered inessential.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Live Rust was the soundtrack to Young's concert film Rust Never Sleeps (he had wanted to give it that title, but Reprise vetoed the idea, fearing confusion with the earlier album), and likewise was recorded October 22, 1978, at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. But much of the Rust Never Sleeps album had been recorded on the same tour, and Live Rust repeated four songs from that disc; besides, since Young had released the career retrospective Decade in 1977, critics felt he was unfairly recycling his older material and repeating his new material. In retrospect, however, Live Rust, now a single 74-minute CD, comes off as an excellent Neil Young live album and career summary, starting with the early song \"Sugar Mountain\" and running through then-new songs like \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\" and \"Powderfinger.\" Young is effective in both his acoustic folksinger and hard-rocking Crazy Horse bandleader modes. The various distractions of the concert itself and the film, such as the pretentious props and cowled roadies, are absent, and what's left is a terrific Neil Young concert recording.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

His strongest collection since Tonight's the Night, its obvious antecedent was Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home, and, as Dylan did, Young divided his record into acoustic and electric sides while filling his songs with wildly imaginative imagery. The leadoff track, \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\" (repeated in an electric version at album's end as \"Hey Hey, My My [Into the Black]\" with slightly altered lyrics), is the most concise and knowing description of the entertainment industry ever written; it was followed by \"Thrasher,\" which describes Young's parallel artistic quest in an extended metaphor that also reflected the album's overall theme -- the inevitability of deterioration and the challenge of overcoming it. Young then spent the rest of the album demonstrating that his chief weapons against rusting were his imagination and his daring, creating an archetypal album that encapsulated his many styles on a single disc with great songs -- in particular the remarkable \"Powderfinger\" -- unlike any he had written before.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The group plays fiercely, as usual, but the lyrics are sketchy, seemingly improvised (the nadir is the nine-minute \"T-Bone,\" which consists of the lines \"Got mashed potato/Ain't got no t-bone\" repeated over and over), and frequently cranky, as in \"Motor City,\" which finds Young criticizing Japanese cars, and \"Rapid Transit,\" which takes a belated swipe at new wave music while sounding like second-rate Talking Heads. For the second album in a row, Young seems to be just fulfilling his one-album-a-year record contract. The exception is the album-closing \"Shots\" (written by 1978), a more substantive and threatening song given a riveting performance. Later, it would be revealed that Young was finding time for his music while giving most of his attention to caring for his disabled son.

Young depends heavily on friends, especially for vocals -- Waylon Jennings sings harmony on six out of the ten tracks, and one of the others is a duet with Willie Nelson. Though populated by cowboys and country references, Young's take on the genre is typically idiosyncratic, including a reworked version of his autobiography in \"Get Back to the Country,\" a cover of the 1956 Gogi Grant hit \"The Wayward Wind,\" and the uncategorizable \"Misfits,\" which portrays astronauts watching Muhammad Ali fights on television in space.

In the fall 1986, he did the same thing, but Life, Young's first album with Crazy Horse since 1981's Re-ac-tor, was not one of his best albums. It was, however, better than most of the other albums he had made in the 1980s, and it was the first really interesting album he'd made in a long time. Despite the return to Crazy Horse, Young continued to use some of the production techniques from Landing on Water, especially the loud drums and the synthesizers. But he mixed things up, including acoustic-based songs such as \"Long Walk Home\" (which recalled \"After the Gold Rush\") and \"Inca Queen\" (the third in his series of long, atmospheric songs about the Incas) and rockers like \"Prisoners of Rock 'n' Roll.\" The last, with its attacks on \"record company clowns\" and chorus \"that's why we don't want to be good,\" seemed intended as the theme song for the Rusted-Out Garage Tour on which it was performed and served as a reminder that Young was still at odds with Geffen Records, which he left after releasing this album. Despite the criticism he had endured for his support of President Reagan's military buildup, Young had foreign policy on his mind in the action-movie-in-song \"Mideast Vacation\" and in \"Long Walk Home,\" which addressed military misadventures from Vietnam to Beirut. It could be argued that Young was repeating himself on much of this material and that the album was typically uneven.

		"review": "<p>Neil Young is famous for scrapping completed albums and substituting hastily recorded ones in radically different styles. Freedom, which was a major critical and commercial comeback after a decade that had confused reviewers and fans, seemed to be a selection of the best tracks from several different unissued Young projects. First and foremost was a hard rock album like the material heard on Young's recent EP, Eldorado (released only in the Far East), several of whose tracks were repeated on Freedom. On these songs -- especially \"Don't Cry,\" which sounded like a song about divorce, and a cover of the old Drifters hit \"On Broadway\" that he concluded by raving about crack -- Young played distorted electric guitar over a rhythm section in an even more raucous fashion than that heard on his Crazy Horse records. Second was a follow-up to Young's previous album, This Note's for You, which had featured a six-piece horn section. They were back on \"Crime in the City\" and \"Someday,\" though these lengthy songs, each of which contained a series of seemingly unrelated, mood-setting verses, were more reminiscent of songs like Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" than of the soul standards that inspired the earlier album. Third, there were tracks that harked back to acoustic-based, country-tinged albums like Harvest and Comes a Time, including \"Hangin' on a Limb\" and \"The Ways of Love,\" two songs on which Young dueted with Linda Ronstadt. There was even a trunk (or, more precisely, a drunk) song, \"Too Far Gone,\" which dated from Young's inebriated Stars 'n Bars period in the '70s. While one might argue that this variety meant few Young fans would be completely pleased with the album, what made it all work was that Young had once again written a great bunch of songs. The romantic numbers were carefully and sincerely written. The long imagistic songs were evocative without being obvious. And bookending the album were acoustic and electric versions of one of Young's great anthems, \"Rockin' in the Free World,\" a song that went a long way toward restoring his political reputation (which had been badly damaged when he praised President Reagan's foreign policy) by taking on hopelessness with a sense of moral outrage and explicitly condemning President Bush's domestic policy. Freedom was the album Neil Young fans knew he was capable of making, but feared he would never make again.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

The album's dominant sound was made by Young's noisy guitar, which bordered on and sometimes slipped over into distortion, while Crazy Horse kept up the songs' bright tempos. Despite the volume, the tunes were catchy, with strong melodies and good choruses, and they were given over to love, humor, and warm reminiscence. They were also platforms for often extended guitar excursions: \"Love to Burn\" and \"Love and Only Love\" ran over ten minutes each, and the album as a whole lasted nearly 63 minutes with only ten songs. Much about the record had a retrospective feel -- the first two tracks, \"Country Home\" and \"White Line,\" were newly recorded versions of songs Young had played with Crazy Horse but never released in the '70s; \"Mansion on the Hill,\" the album's most accessible track, celebrated a place where \"psychedelic music fills the air\" and \"peace and love live there still\"; there was a cover of the Premiers' garage rock oldie \"Farmer John\"; and \"Days That Used to Be,\" in addition to its backward-looking theme, borrowed the melody from Bob Dylan's \"My Back Pages\" (by way of the Byrds' arrangement), while \"Mother Earth (Natural Anthem)\" was the folk standard \"The Water Is Wide\" with new, environmentally aware lyrics. Young was not generally known as an artist who evoked the past this much, but if he could extend his creative rebirth with music this exhilarating, no one was likely to complain.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Recorded in 1990 at a small Santa Cruz club, this joyous live document flips the energy of 1991's Weld on its head, swapping out incendiary arena rockers for oddball picks and warm, woolly vibes.</p><p>Neil Young entered the 1990's acting as if his erratic 1980's never happened. He spent the bulk of the '80s sowing wild oats while in an unhappy union with Geffen Records. The label was so aggrieved by the mercurial singer-songwriter's behavior that they filed suit against Young, accusing him of purposefully delivering uncommercial albums. Perhaps they had a point: Once he returned to his old home at Reprise, he started making music like he had in the old days. Buoyed by the creative and commercial rebirth of 1989's Freedom, Young reconnected with Crazy Horse, the ambling backing band who had supported him through good times and bad since way back in 1969. Picking up a fuzzy strand left hanging from Rust Never Sleeps, the 1979 album that represented their last great triumph, Young and Crazy Horse knocked out Ragged Glory at his Broken Arrow Ranch in a few weeks. The quick sessions resulted in an album with a spontaneous feel; it was the liveliest and loudest Crazy Horse had ever sounded in the studio.</p><p>As a full-bore rock'n'roll record, Ragged Glory was an ideal album to take out on the road, which is precisely what Neil Young and Crazy Horse did, spending the first four months of 1991 roaring through North America's arenas with supporting acts Sonic Youth and Social Distortion in tow. Young's decision to bring a pair of prominent alternative rockers on tour underscored the wild, untamed character of his work with Crazy Horse, with its swirls of distortion and primitive thump. The ensuing live 2xLP, Weld, and feedback-laden Arc EP tapped into the arena-sized aggression that fueled the band at its peak, all the way back to 1979's incendiary Live Rust. Way Down in the Rust Bucket, the 12th live album in Young's ongoing (and now absurdly active) Archives series, flips that energy on its head. Here, Crazy Horse aren't interested in assaulting their audience; instead, they're grooving along alongside them.</p><p>Some of this change in tone is surely due to the change in venue. Way Down in the Rust Bucket captures a November 13, 1990 gig at the small Santa Cruz club the Catalyst, a hometown bar that became Young's regular stomping ground in 1977, when he spent the summer figuring out whether his ill-fated group the Ducks had a future. The Ducks didn't survive 1977, but Young's connection to the Catalyst endured; it became a place for him to limber up before heading back out on the road. That's precisely what happened in November 1990: With two months to go before a big arena tour, the time was ripe to kick off the cobwebs. Playing in their own backyard&mdash;for fans who were close enough to be friends, and friends who were more like family&mdash;shaped the concert from its setlist to its execution. Gone are expected crowd-pleasers like \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black),\" \"Powderfinger,\" \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and \"Tonight's the Night,\" all swapped out for oddball selections designed to scratch some itch of the band: American Stars 'n Bars' cornpone romp \"Homegrown,\" a revved-up reading of the Re·ac·tor deep cut \"Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze,\" plus the inane blues stomp \"T-Bone.\"</p><p>As silly as it sounds, \"T-Bone\" provides the key to unlocking many of Way Down in the Rust Bucket's charms. It's not much of a song&mdash;there are no other lyrics than \"Got mashed potatoes/Ain't got no T-Bone\"&mdash;yet hearing Crazy Horse lock into a primal rhythm then remain there for nearly seven minutes, as Young delivers each repetition of its lone line as if it's a new punchline, is as invigorating as his elongated solos. There's a direct line connecting this rave-up with \"Farmer John,\" a frat-rock classic from Don & Dewey by way of the Premiers that wound up as a touchstone on Ragged Glory: They're party tunes played by a band intent on having a hell of a good time.</p><p>Young spent 1990 absolutely giddy with the monstrous, transportive racket he could make with Crazy Horse, but those high spirits don't always come through on Weld. Blame some of that on the arena setting; blame some of it on timing. During those early months of 1991, Crazy Horse toured as Operation Desert Storm descended on Iraq, so Young sobered up, putting an earnest and angry version of Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" in a prominent position in the set list, then leaning into the group's harder edges. Way Down in the Rust Bucket, recorded just months earlier, has no socio-political undertones and no angst; here, \"Fuckin' Up\" doesn't play as self-immolation, it's merely a heavy shrug. Crazy Horse's immense volume camouflages a sweet hippie heart, an empathy that's apparent in both the selected songs and the warm, woolly performance. This is a joyous record, where even the melancholy epics \"Like a Hurricane\" and \"Cortez the Killer\" skirt sadness. Crazy Horse lumber toward bliss, goosed along by a leader who seems so enraptured by his own solos he doesn't want to break the spell. Context also gives these seemingly endless workouts a different vibe. They're surrounded by garage rockers and reconstituted anthems of the counterculture, songs designed to be played and heard in a communal setting. For a dirty, grungy rock'n'roll band, there's no better place to hold communion than the local pub, where the separation between artist and audience can be so thin, it may as well be nonexistent. Maybe that's why Way Down in the Rust Bucket feels transcendent: It captures the world's greatest bar band in their spiritual home.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>History shows us there are plenty of bands where the whole is more than the sum of the parts, and Neil Young & Crazy Horse are a great example of how the right combination of musicians can create a tide that lifts all boats. Though Crazy Horse never do anything especially complicated, the loose but thoroughly deep groove they generate fits Young's musical ideas better than nearly any of his collaborators, and they give him the room to stretch out on guitar and make the most of his noisy explorations of melodic space; Young is rarely as inspired a soloist as he is with Crazy Horse, and they were in especially fine form on 1990's Ragged Glory, where their laid-back thunder brought out some especially inspired performances after a string of inconsistent projects from Young in the '80s. They were about to hit the road in support of the album when they played a pair of shows at The Catalyst, a 800-capacity club in Santa Cruz, California, to familiarize themselves with the material. Way Down in the Rust Bucket gives an authorized release to a previously bootlegged performance on November 13, 1990 when the group ambled through 19 songs in just under two-and-a-half hours. If it's possible to rock hard and seem relaxed at the same time, that's exactly the vibe that informs Way Down in the Rust Bucket. This doesn't match the fire of the arena shows that followed (you can hear what they sounded like on 1991's Weld), but Crazy Horse sound like they're having a great time making their way through most of Ragged Glory and throwing in some favorites from their back catalog along the way (even more surprising than hearing three tunes from 1975's Zuma is the appearance of two from 1981's noisy and idiosyncratic Re-ac-tor).</p><p>Way Down in the Rust Bucket sometimes sounds like the musicians are playing for themselves as much as the audience, suggesting a public rehearsal tape, and that actually works in its favor; Young and his bandmates aren't pushing themselves especially hard, but they find the sweet spot in these songs and ride it for all its worth. Young was clearly having a great night on guitar, with Crazy Horse more than happy to help him out. Way Down in the Rust Bucket isn't one of the more revelatory items to emerge from Neil Young's archives since he began major excavation in the mid-2000s. However, for those who consider the joyous stomp of Neil Young & Crazy Horse rock & roll comfort food at its best, this is a feast to savor, a long and rollicking celebration of the pleasures of turning up the amps and inviting in the spirit.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Mark Deming</strong></p>"

Such warhorses as \"Like a Hurricane\" and \"Cortez the Killer\" were making their fourth appearances on a Young album, and the five songs from the Ragged Glory album were basically unchanged from their studio versions. Containing only 16 tracks, the album's songs averaged over seven and a half minutes in length, and that length was given over to extended guitar improvisations, which often were filled with feedback and distortion. Where Young's previous double live album, Live Rust, which bore some similarities to this one, was a career retrospective including some acoustic numbers, Weld was all electric rock with Crazy Horse. The one previously unreleased song was a Gulf War-era cover of Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" complete with gunshots and exploding bombs. In retrospect, Weld seems like an excellent expression of one part of Young's musical persona, putting some of his best hard rock material onto one album. [Initially, Weld was released in a 25,000 copy limited-edition called Arc Weld (Reprise 26746) containing a third disc made up of guitar feedback and called \"Arc.\"]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Unlike Crazy Horse's sonic bludgeoning, the Gators' light playing featured ethereal-sounding pedal steel and harmonies that caressed like a gentle lover. This was the perfect compliment for Young's songwriting, which was fueled by romantic notions of courtship and deep thought. Young and Nicolette Larson harmonized and became the lovers of \"You and Me,\" whereas Jack Nitzsche's string arrangements made for a nice contrast in \"Such a Woman,\" a bold-faced declaration of love. Other insights into the normally cranky iconoclast's sentimental side include the delicate touch of the title track, which leaves an image of slow-dancing in a dark corner.</p><p>Fast approaching 50, Neil Young also used Harvest Moon to reflect back on his life, particularly in the biographical \"One of These Days,\" and \"From Hank to Hendrix,\" a twangy sequel to \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of The Blue).\" Young also continued his commitment to the environment by including both a protest against man's destruction of nature (\"War of Man\") and a live tribute to the forest and jungles recorded at a Portland, Oregon performance that included sounds of the Brazilian rainforest (\"Natural Beauty.\")</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

This 73-minute tape ran seven minutes longer than the album, the extra time consisting of applause, guitar tuning, and a few scattered asides (\"Aw, it's nothin', really,\" Young said, for example, after an audience member called out, \"Thank you, Neil\"). Young was anything but videogenic in his leather jacket, Harley Davidson T-shirt, jeans, and boots, sitting hunched over his guitar, often scowling as he turned his face, hooded with unruly, grey-flecked hair and partially covered by a week-old stubble, to the microphone. Yet his casual appearance and introspective demeanor served to focus attention on his music. And a 14-song set that on record seemed a random selection from across his career made more sense on video, as Young began with a series of early songs, accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica, then moving to keyboards and gradually bringing other musicians on-stage to augment the sound. The songs were wistful, midtempo reflections on stardom, love, and the passage of time. Some were familiar, including \"Mr. Soul\" and \"Like a Hurricane,\" and were given new treatments; others were obscure or even previously unrecorded (\"Stringman\"). But all were melodic and inviting, especially the selections from Harvest Moon, including the title tune, which featured a broom as a percussion instrument. Unplugged was a low-key Neil Young performance that emphasized the consistency of his work over time and the repetition of certain lyrical themes and musical tendencies. If it avoided some of his best-known folk and country material, it did contain a few crowd-pleasers, and it brought up several forgotten tunes for reconsideration.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

		"review": "Though it once again reunites him with Crazy Horse and includes such typical rock workouts as the lengthy \"Change Your Mind\" and the raucous \"Piece of Crap,\" Sleeps With Angels is more musically varied than most of Neil Young's albums with his erstwhile backup group, ranging from piano-based ballads like the album opener, \"My Heart,\" and closer, \"A Dream That Can Last,\" which might have fit on After the Gold Rush, to the country-folk \"Train of Love,\" which sounds like a leftover from Harvest Moon, and the hard-edged grunge of the title track. The Crazy Horse influence comes in the songs' structural simplicity and the unpolished playing. Though musically diverse, Sleeps With Angels is a song cycle in which Young repeats the same themes and images. To put it simply, the album is about death, presumably primarily the suicide of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, which occurred while it was being recorded. From \"My Heart,\" which declares, \"It's not too late\" and \"Somehow, someone has a dream come true,\" to \"A Dream That Can Last,\" which declares, \"There's a better life for me someday,\" Young begins and ends with a shaky, uncertain optimism, even though his language is riddled with references to violence, especially gunfire, and desperation. As in the album's title, even the references to sleep and dreams are about death. Young repeats some of the same lines from song to song and sometimes the same music (\"Western Hero\" and \"Train of Love\" have the same tune). The album thus has a tired, mournful feel that is both compelling and off-putting. Young had not investigated such forbidding territory since the days of Tonight's the Night and On the Beach, and Sleeps With Angels is on a par with those often harrowing works.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

At the start of the record, he can be heard instructing them: \"No tuning, nothing,\" and the take of \"I'm the Ocean\" is an obvious run-through that became a master take. But Pearl Jam is not Crazy Horse; in place of the latter's primitive, nonswinging sound, the former boasts spirited rhythms and dense guitar interplay that Young makes excellent use of in a series of songs built out of simple, melodic rifts. Those songs come mostly in pairs: \"Song X\" and \"Act of Love,\" the first two tracks, both seem to be about abortion, especially in its religious aspect, each containing a reference to \"the holy war\"; \"What Happened to Yesterday\" and \"Fallen Angel\" are song fragments on which Young plays the pump organ; and \"Downtown\" and \"Peace and Love\" find Young addressing the musical and philosophical concerns of hippies and contain name checks of Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, and Led Zeppelin. The songs also share highly imagistic lyrics that are allusive and frequently just obscure. At their best, notably on \"I'm the Ocean\" and \"Scenery,\" they provide intriguing portraits of the artist -- \"People my age/They don't do the things I do,\" Young sings in \"Ocean\" -- while \"Scenery\" is one of his bitter denunciations of celebrity. Such subject matter is not new for Young, and Mirror Ball is typically uneven. But it is always interesting musically, suggesting that he has found another catch-up that works. Probably due to the commercial power of Pearl Jam, the album became Young's highest charting record since Harvest 23 years earlier, though it had a relatively short chart life.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>William Ruhlmann</strong></p>"

Broken Arrow floats on waves of lumbering guitars and cascading feedback, ebbing and flowing with winding solos and drifting melodies. In a typical display of artistic perversion, Young has front-loaded the album with three epics with a combined running time of just over 25 minutes. Following the three epic-length songs come four concise tunes that range from the country-rock stomp of \"Changing Highways\" to the reflective \"Music Arcade.\" Like the three songs that preceded them, these songs are uneven, with hazy melodies and underdeveloped lyrics. Finally, a long, live workout of Jimmy Reed's \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" -- which sounds like it was taken from an audience recording -- is tacked onto the end of the album. Although the song is a standout, it raises the question: what is the purpose of Broken Arrow? The album floats from song to song, with the guitars drowning out the sound of Young's voice. There are some fine songs buried amid the long jams, but the album is directionless, and that lack of direction never manages to develop a consistent emotional tone.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

The endless delays raised hopes for the album, as did superstition — dedicated Neil Young fans believed he was creatively reborn at the end of each decade. Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Rust Never Sleeps, and Freedom added credence to this theory, but those records were knocked out quickly, appearing a year after their predecessors. In contrast, Silver & Gold appeared four years after Broken Arrow. During those four years, all sorts of projects were in the works for Young, including a 1999 reunion with Crosby, Stills & Nash. His three songs on their comeback Looking Forward were pleasant acoustic numbers that often seemed a little slight. It was easy to assume that Young was saving the real treasures for his solo record, but Silver & Gold doesn't confirm that theory. Instead, it's a continuation of his Looking Forward contributions, performed with the warm, amiable ramble of Harvest Moon. A pleasant sound, to be sure, but not exactly what Young followers were expecting. They also may be a little dismayed to realize that two of its best songs, \"Silver & Gold\" and \"Razor Love,\" date from 1982 and 1987, respectively, suggesting that Neil may not be at the top of his game. Still, there are no truly bad songs here, although the light-hearted, light-headed reminiscence \"Buffalo Springfield Again\" treads close to the borderline. It's a low-key, charming, comfortable record, which is hardly a bad thing at all — it just doesn't quite live up to the abnormally high expectations. Fortunately, those expectations fade upon repeated plays, and Silver & Gold reveals itself as a nice Neil Young record. Nothing particularly special, but nice all the same.</p>&mdash; <b>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</b>"

And it doesn't shy away from this indulgence, either, opening with an 18-minute \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" that only diehards could sit through. And, in a sense, that summarizes this album, since only diehards will thrill to an 11-minute \"Words,\" a previously unreleased \"Fool for Your Love,\" a ten-minute \"Tonight's the Night,\" or an \"All Along the Watchtower\" featuring opener Chrissie Hynde on guitar. This isn't bad, but it's not really good, either, and as the third live album in one decade, it's not just anticlimatic, it's unnecessary even for diehards, who probably would find this more exciting as a bootleg than an official album.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Prior to its release, Greendale received more attention than any Neil Young album in years, but it wasn't positive. Young hauled out his concept album -- about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they're torn apart by a murder -- to unsuspecting audiences, who by and large were not happy about spending anywhere from 55 to 85 dollars to hear a dense convoluted song cycle, complete with rambling narrative from Young, for the first hour of the show and not hearing many hits in the remainder of the set. Early in the summer of 2003, there was a brief blast of stories about this quasi-scandal, setting the stage for the late-summer release of the album: it got Young some needed press, and announced that unlike his last several albums, Young was actually trying this time around. Frankly, he needed a change. Ever since 1994's Sleeps With Angels -- or, if you're less charitable, 1990's Ragged Glory -- he had been drifting, playing with different groups, never quite mustering up enough energy to assemble a consistent set of songs whenever he headed into the studio. Here, the story and the setting give Young a hook for the record, a common theme that he can rally around, and the album benefits so much from that focus that it doesn't really matter that the story is convoluted beyond comprehension; the plot matters so much that it winds up not mattering at all. Close attention and repeated listens offer few rewards to the careful listener, because Young doesn't really say much of anything here, no matter how elaborately he says it. Learning more about the narrative -- whether it's through the simultaneously released DVD of the Young-directed film Greendale, hearing his rambling on-stage between-song narratives, or reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes -- illuminates the story slightly, even as declarations like \"When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are\" emphasize the suspicion that there's not much meaning in the whole enterprise.</p><p>All this doesn't really matter because Greendale works as a record -- it ebbs and flows and it holds together, playing as a unified whole on a level he hasn't approached since Ragged Glory. As Young says in the liner notes, these are things \"you can't tell by listening to the songs, you have to listen to the instrumentals to get this,\" and while that is meant to apply to one of the many Crazy Horse-fueled meandering improvs, it really applies to the album as a whole since Greendale connects in its overall picture, not the details. Sometimes, such as the quietly eerie and affecting \"Bandit,\" the songs stand apart from the concept, but usually the lyrics are too devoted to his winding narrative to be their own entities. Then again, Greendale was designed to be an interconnected song cycle, and if the narrative neither works nor signifies much, it nevertheless kept Young focused on the construction of the album, whether it's giving the songs memorable hooks or finding ways to make the signature ramshackle vibe of Crazy Horse sound both fresh and appropriate for this tale. It all adds up to a very good record -- one that is interesting, and one that satisfies musically. It may not be a latter-day masterpiece on the level of Dylan's Love and Theft, but it most surely is a comeback for an artist who seemed permanently adrift at sea.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

That's a span of 27 years separating the two collections, which is an awful long time to resist a Greatest Hits disc — many of his peers succumbed, offering countless comps during those years — and such a resistance to a compilation may not be much a surprise from the legendarily prickly Young, but what is a surprise is that 11 of the 16 songs on <i>Greatest Hits</i> were also on <i>Decade</i>. Of the five songs that were not on Decade, only two date from after the '70s — 1989's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and 1992's \"Harvest Moon\" — while one of the remaining three (1970's \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\") comes from the time chronicled on <i>Decade</i>; the other two, 1978's \"Comes a Time\" and 1979's \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black),\" arrived in the two years of the '70s not covered on the 1977 compilation. </p><p>All this means is that <i>Greatest Hits</i> offers the basic canon, with no frills and none of Neil's trademark idiosyncrasy. Some may miss that cantankerous spirit, pointing out that this contains nothing from his towering twin masterpieces of dark introspection — <i>Tonight's the Night</i> and <i>On the Beach</i> — or that there's nothing from Buffalo Springfield (which was covered on <i>Decade</i>) and that noteworthy songs like \"Powderfinger,\" \"Cortez the Killer,\" \"Lotta Love,\" and \"Long May You Run\" are missing. Ultimately, that doesn't matter much, because <i>Greatest Hits</i> has all the songs that every Neil Young fan, from the devoted to the casual listener, agrees are his biggest and best: \"Down by the River,\" \"Cinnamon girl,\" \"Helpless,\" \"After the Gold Rush,\" \"Southern Man,\" \"Ohio,\" \"The Needle and the Damage Done,\" \"Old Man,\" \"Heart of Gold,\" \"Like a Hurricane.\" And that's why it works as an all-business introduction for the uninitiated and as a concise summary for those not willing to travel down all the long, winding roads Young has traveled over the years. In other words, it's as good a compilation as it could have been. [<i>Greatest Hits</i> was released in several editions. In addition to the basic single CD, there was a limited edition containing a DVD video with the promo clips for \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and \"Harvest Moon.\" There was another limited edition with a bonus 7\" record. Finally, it was also released as a high-resolution DVD Audio disc.]</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Neil Young is the kind of man that appreciates albums in the traditional sense: cohesive beginning-to-end statements, occasionally thematic if the mood suits him, and preferably experienced through big speakers on crackly old vinyl. His resistance to digital music has been well-documented, and until recently, several of his releases&mdash;including 1974's classic On the Beach&mdash;had never been made available on compact disc. So one can imagine him in an A&R; office upstairs at Reprise Records, year after year, continually shooting down the concept of a compilation that attempts to condense his entire history onto a single disc. He's already been compiled once anyway&mdash;with the 1977 3xLP retrospective Decade.</p><p>Regardless, we're now being offered Greatest Hits, although Young does seems begrudging: Its only liner notes are the obligatory song credits and one line from Young himself that simply states, \"Greatest hits inclusion based on original record sales, airplay, and known download history.\" These criteria are not only anathema to his aesthetic (since when does the man behind \"This Note's For You\" care about airplay?), but here they comprise a collection that only skims the surface of his catalog: The tracklist features 16 songs from his 35-year career, ranging from 1969's \"Down by the River\" to 1991's \"Harvest Moon\".</p><p>Young's stubborn integrity extends beyond his politics&mdash;which inform all of his songs, but only define a few like \"Ohio\" and \"Rockin' in the Free World\"&mdash;and saturates his music. His catalog is riddled with sharp contrasts and sly contradictions, not least of which is the fact that this bearish-looking man sings with such a fragile falsetto. More crucially, Young moves from ragged guitar epics to jangly country ballads with impressive agility. He's also not one to rein in his songs, so they may often run for only two intense minutes (\"The Needle and the Damage Done\") or sprawl to upwards of nine (\"Down by the River\", \"Cowgirl in the Sand\").</p><p>These extremes make for a strange and strangely compelling Greatest Hits. Conceptually, it shouldn't work: Young has played many roles over five decades, but indeed, he's never been a singles artist. In fact, he has only a passing acquaintance with the pop singles chart&mdash;\"Heart of Gold\" went to #1, but he's had only two other solo top 40 singles&mdash;and many of his most popular songs run much longer than the typical single's three minutes.</p><p>The disc begins, perversely and brilliantly, with the one-two punch of \"Down By the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\", which together total almost 20 minutes. This seems less an act of rebellion than a simple stroke of luck, as the compilation is sequenced chronologically. Even so, the songs illustrate clearly that Young and the hits format aren't exactly perfect for each other, while still constituting an impressive introduction for newcomers. Which is precisely what this record is designed to do.</p><p>Greatest Hits is obviously intended mostly for curious initiates or casual listeners (although the remastered tracks will likely attract hardcore Young fans, too), and it achieves its goals sufficiently. Those unacquainted with his work will learn that Young was a tremendous guitar player who gave himself ample room to range; that Crazy Horse understood the need to provide a good backdrop for his solos and knew how to churn a drag-the-river momentum; that Young was an able songwriter who could craft a killer line like \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" clincher \"every junkie's like a setting sun.\" What they won't learn is the difference between Young's work with Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills & Nash: All 16 tracks are presented as Young's solo work, which is misleading. Historical liner notes could have cleared this up and even introduced Young's collaborators. Instead, the package leaves it to listeners to infer these distinctions from the song credits.</p><p>Fittingly, Greatest Hits skews to Young's early material: Eleven of these tracks represent his 1969-71 output, and only two songs postdate the 1970s (and, therefore, the still-in-print, two-disc Decade). The implication is that Young more or less faded away, and that his first few albums far outshine his subsequent material. But such a view is surely reductive: Young has not only been actively releasing albums throughout the 90s and into the 00s, but several of them been unexpectedly solid as well. The sadly missed \"Cortez the Killer\" and \"Tonight's the Night\" are the set's most obvious exclusions, but the dismissal of late-era tracks like \"This Note's for You\", \"Fuckin' Up\", or even \"From Hank to Hendrix\" is unfortunate, too.</p><p>Of course, it's all too easy to nitpick any greatest-hits tracklist&mdash;any of them could be said to carry grievous omissions or curious inclusions. On one hand, this type of cursory overview isn't supposed to give us a detailed portrait of the artist, only a general sketch; on the other, Young is too complex a musician to be adequately represented by a mere 16 songs. The music on Greatest Hits holds up undeniably well, but the concept itself&mdash;perhaps inevitably&mdash;falters, failing to capture the essence of one of rock's sturdiest and most ragged voices.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M.

That's a span of 27 years separating the two collections, which is an awful long time to resist a Greatest Hits disc -- many of his peers succumbed, offering countless comps during those years -- and such a resistance to a compilation may not be much a surprise from the legendarily prickly Young, but what is a surprise is that 11 of the 16 songs on Greatest Hits were also on Decade. Of the five songs that were not on Decade, only two date from after the '70s -- 1989's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and 1992's \"Harvest Moon\" -- while one of the remaining three (1970's \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\") comes from the time chronicled on Decade; the other two, 1978's \"Comes a Time\" and 1979's \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black),\" arrived in the two years of the '70s not covered on the 1977 compilation. All this means is that Greatest Hits offers the basic canon, with no frills and none of Neil's trademark idiosyncrasy. Some may miss that cantankerous spirit, pointing out that this contains nothing from his towering twin masterpieces of dark introspection -- Tonight's the Night and On the Beach -- or that there's nothing from Buffalo Springfield (which was covered on Decade) and that noteworthy songs like \"Powderfinger,\" \"Cortez the Killer,\" \"Lotta Love,\" and \"Long May You Run\" are missing. Ultimately, that doesn't matter much, because Greatest Hits has all the songs that every Neil Young fan, from the devoted to the casual listener, agrees are his biggest and best: \"Down by the River,\" \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Helpless,\" \"After the Gold Rush,\" \"Southern Man,\" \"Ohio,\" \"The Needle and the Damage Done,\" \"Old Man,\" \"Heart of Gold,\" \"Like a Hurricane.\" And that's why it works as an all-business introduction for the uninitiated and as a concise summary for those not willing to travel down all the long, winding roads Young has traveled over the years. In other words, it's as good a compilation as it could have been. [Greatest Hits was released in several editions. In addition to the basic single CD, there was a limited edition containing a DVD video with the promo clips for \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and \"Harvest Moon.\" There was another limited edition with a bonus 7\" record. Finally, it was also released as a high-resolution DVD Audio disc.]</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Neil Young spent his 2006 hawking Living with War, an album as immediate as a news bulletin, so perhaps it made sense that after its promo push was done he would retreat into the past, planning to finally finish Archives, the long-promised box set of unreleased performances from his vaults. Two individual discs of classic live performances were released in the winter of 2006/2007, acting as a teaser for the proposed fall release of the box, but like with most things involving Neil, things didn't work precisely as planned, as he once again pushed Archives to the back burner so he could release Chrome Dreams II, a sequel to an album that never came out in the first place. The first Chrome Dreams was slated for a 1977 release, but for some indiscernible reason Young scrapped the album, parsing out some of the songs on subsequent albums, sometimes re-recording the originals, sometimes overdubbing, sometimes just sticking the previously unreleased tracks onto new albums. Among the Chrome Dreams songs that popped later are some of his greatest, including \"Like a Hurricane\" and an originally acoustic \"Powderfinger\" and \"Pocahontas,\" along with other such excellent tunes as \"Sedan Delivery,\" \"Too Far Gone,\" and \"Look Out for My Love,\" a pedigree that would suggest that Chrome Dreams II could include its fair share of major songs. Despite the inclusion of the long-bootlegged (and simply long at a lumbering 18 minutes) \"Ordinary People,\" that's not quite true: it's a modest collection of stray songs and new tunes, pieced together in a fashion similar to 1989's Freedom, which in fact is where the 1977 \"Too Far Gone\" was finally unveiled.</p><p>Indeed, Chrome Dreams II shares more similarities to Freedom than the original Chrome Dreams -- so much so that it's a mystery why it's dubbed as a sequel, but it's a mystery not worth pondering, as there are few clues to their correlation, and even if a definitive answer to their kinship could be dredged up, it wouldn't illuminate the 2007 album, which is merely a good Neil Young album. Perhaps a little more than good, actually, as this has a shagginess and tattered heart that's been missing from his work for a long time, as he's spent a good chunk of the past 15 years pursuing conceptual works, ranging from thematic concept albums (Living with War, Greendale) to musical genre exercises (Are You Passionate?, Prairie Wind). Here Neil dabbles in all his signatures, starting the album with the sweet country corn of \"Beautiful Bluebird,\" then careening to the mildly menacing minor-key groove \"Boxcar\" before he gets to the light, almost bouncy soul-pop of \"The Believer\" (complete with call-and-response backing vocals), the Crazy Horse mysticism of \"Spirit Road,\" the lazy loping country of \"Every After,\" and the elongated guitar workout of \"No Hidden Path.\" He even gets way out with \"The Way,\" singing with a children's choir, a stab at innocence that's cheerfully at odds with the sludgy \"Dirty Old Man,\" an unexpected revival of the boneheaded off-color jokes of \"Welfare Mothers,\" and then, of course, there's the album's centerpiece, \"Ordinary People,\" a winding epic recorded with the Bluenotes in 1988 that's dated in its splashy production (and perhaps its blaring horns, since Neil largely abandoned the Bluenotes after This Note's for You), yet it sounds immediate and gripping. It's the kind of song to build an album upon, which is precisely what Neil has done with Chrome Dreams II, using it as an excuse to round up other songs with no home. This doesn't make for an album that holds together thematically the way other latter-day Neil albums do, but its mess is endearing, recalling how charmingly ragged albums like After the Gold Rush, Tonight's the Night, Rust Never Sleeps, and Freedom are, even if Chrome Dreams II never manages to soar as high as those classics.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>The original Chrome Dreams contained some of Neil Young's most enduring electric blowouts and most somber, stirring folk-rock. That is, it would have, had it ever come out. Scrapped in 1977, Chrome Dreams has earned a place alongside Smile and Lifehouse in the Pantheon of Lost Albums, a puzzle for obsessive fans and bootleggers to try and reconstruct. Fortunately, the record was thoroughly stripped for parts, and among its 12 songs, classics \"Like a Hurricane\" and \"Pocahontas\" popped up on other Young albums.</p><p>So now, 30 years later, Young has decided his new album is a sequel to that career enigma, referencing a chapter only his most dedicated fans would know about. Why? The fuck if I know. Part of Young's charm and continued credibility is that he's grown more inscrutable as his hair has grayed, the opposite trajectory of most of his Rock Hall of Fame peers. After his brush with death in 2005, one might have expected the singer-songwriter to slow down, or at least write a bunch of grim songs about mortality&mdash;this is, after all, the guy who was singing about getting old when he was 24. But instead, Young has sped up his work rate and zagged at every opportunity, quick-fire releasing the ambitious Nashville throwback Prairie Wind and the hurried, furious Living With War.</p><p>Chrome Dreams II is less conceptually consistent than those two records; the family resemblance to its predecessor may simply be a matter of their shared scattershot approach. Indulging a grab-bag of styles and dusting off some long-shelved unreleased tracks, the record veers from Hallmark-card country to lite-soul throwbacks to Rust Never Sleeps-like garage rock. This variety might be distracting, were Young not so firmly loyal to the overarching production sound and band collaborators he's kept over the last ten years, with only his recent fondness for choral backing vocals doing much to distinguish it from his earlier work.</p><p>Strange then that the album's centerpiece, the 18-minute novella \"Ordinary People\", was actually recorded during Young's notorious 1980s identity disorder; it's a holdover from his 1988 r&b dalliance This Note's for You. Obviously, a song with a runtime that impressive necessitates the use of terms like \"sprawling\" and \"epic,\" and it is pretty impressive, its 20 verses providing a stack of snapshots of life for drug dealers, assembly line workers, and the homeless between zealous horn and guitar solos. It aims to be the Band's \"The Weight\", and while it doesn't quite reach those lofty heights, it's a solid working-class anthem, despite the staleness of references to Lee Iacocca and boxing as an important cultural event.</p><p>In the shadow of \"Ordinary People\", the rest of Chrome Dreams II sounds a bit wispy&mdash;particularly the surprisingly adult-contempo, over-sentimental \"Beautiful Bluebird\" and \"Shining Light\". The faux Motown of \"The Believer\" is a little bit better, but somewhat reminiscent of 2002's Are You Passionate?, an uncomfortable lowlight of late-period Neil. Matched up against the raw, solemn acoustic classics&mdash;\"Will to Love\", \"Star of Bethlehem\"&mdash;of the original Chrome, it's telling how far Neil's ability to sculpt his quieter material into something haunting rather than hokey has faded with age.</p><p>But the electric numbers, both the compact \"Spirit Road\" and the extended knee-bend workout of \"No Hidden Path\", still ripple with vitality, even though they feature only one-third of Crazy Horse. Neither match the furious beauty of \"Like a Hurricane\", and \"Dirty Old Man\" might be a pale imitation of the raucous \"Sedan Delivery,\" but it's still thrilling to hear Young getting his aggression out, letting the undiminished fury of his guitar tone saw off the shackles of age.</p><p>Whether the album title is Young seriously trying to reconnect to a specific moment of his past or perhaps simply making an inside joke, it's an apt demonstration that he can still shapeshift with the best of them. But while Neil Young's self-fractionation abilities are intact, the low hit to miss ratio of Chrome Dreams II is proof that not all of those personae are still quite as functional as they once were, around the time of Chapter One. Though having one good trick in the bag keeps him from becoming a mere oldies jukebox like so many other 40-year rock vets, the sampler platter of Chrome Dreams II suggests his renowned versatility, by comparison to its cult-classic ancestor, ain't what it used to be.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Rob Mitchum, Pitchfork</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Since Prairie Wind is a return to the soft, lush country-rock sound of Harvest; since Neil Young suffered a brain aneurysm during its recording; since it finds the singer/songwriter reflecting on life and family in the wake of his father's death; and since it's his most cohesive album in a decade, it would seem that all these factors add up to a latter-day masterpiece for Young, but that's not quite the case. Prairie Wind manages to be less than the sum of its parts and the problem isn't a lack of good songs (although it does have a few more clunkers than it should) or a botched concept. Young's decision to revive the country-rock that brought him his greatest popularity never feels like a cynical move -- the music is too warm, comfortable, and friendly to feel like anything but Neil playing to his strengths. However, since he cut this in Nashville with a bunch of studio pros including legendary keyboardist Spooner Oldham, it feels just a tad slicker than perhaps it should, since the smooth sound inadvertently highlights the sentimentality of the project. It's hard to begrudge Young if he wants to indulge in rose-colored memories -- a brush with death coupled with a loss of a parent tends to bring out sentimentality -- but such backward-gazing songs as \"Far from Home\" feel just a hair too close to trite, and the easy-rolling nature of the record doesn't lend them much gravity. There a few other songs that tend toward too close to the simplistic, whether it's the specific invocations of 9/11 and Chris Rock on \"No Wonder\" or the supremely silly Elvis salute \"He Was the King,\" which are just enough to undermine the flow of the album, even if they fit into the general autumnal, reflective mood of the record. But since they do fit the overall feel of the album, and since they're better, even with their flaws, than the best songs on, say, Silver & Gold or Broken Arrow or Are You Passionate?, they help elevate the whole of Prairie Wind, particularly because there are some genuinely strong Young songs here: the moody opener \"The Painter,\" the gently sighing \"Fallin' off the Face of the Earth,\" the ethereal \"It's a Dream,\" the sweet, laid-back \"Here for Your,\" the understated \"This Old Guitar\" (there's also the sweeping \"When God Made Me,\" recorded complete with a gospel chorus, one that will either strike a listener as moving or maudlin -- a latter-day \"A Man Needs a Maid,\" only not as strong). This set of songs does indeed make Prairie Wind a better album than anything Young has released in the past decade, which means that it's easy to overrate it. For despite all of its strengths, neither the recording nor the songs are as memorable or as fully realized as his late-'80s/early-'90s comeback records -- Freedom, Ragged Glory, and Harvest Moon -- let alone his classic '70s work. Nevertheless, it's the closest Young has come to making a record that could hold its own with those albums in well over a decade, which means it's worthwhile even if it's never quite as great as it seems like it could have been.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen Thomas Erlewine</strong></p><hr/><p>Neil Young turns 60 in November. In the last year he's survived an aneurysm and a greatest hits album. So why hasn't the man started to sound old? Sure, his voice quavers on some of the high notes on his ambitious new album, Prairie Wind, but he sounds remarkably preserved, showing the same age and wear he's shown for years: That voice&mdash;alternately gentle and strident, tender and outraged&mdash;has held up surprisingly well, gaining gritty authority with age. His few cracks and wrinkles just reinforce the sense of wistful nostalgia that suffuses Prairie Wind as well as almost all his other folk-rock albums since Harvest Moon, if not since Harvest.</p><p>Young has made this sort of no-surprises reliability a virtue. He long ago set the templates for his music, and while he's known for his itchy restlessness, late in his career he doesn't stray from that comfortable sound. The scope of his albums grows immodestly&mdash;his previous, Greendale, was even accompanied by a film&mdash;but his music, whether time-capsule folk like Prairie Wind or ragged-glory rock, remains the same size, exhibiting his confidence that a small voice can address enormous issues on a personal level. That constancy can be consoling, despite the themes of loss that haunts his songs.</p><p>There's something proudly old-fashioned about Prairie Wind, specifically in its simple visions of America, as in the title track's central image of a farmer's wife hanging laundry in the backyard. Even the title itself hopes for the possibility of more American frontiers, a new home on the range instead of a McMansion in the 'burbs. In other words, Young's concerns are deeply buried in the past, in a vision of history that seems simpler than the present. To his credit, he isn't another 1960s boomer insisting that everything was better back then, man&mdash;his music hasn't changed that dramatically. There are a few moments of fuzzy nostalgia, as on \"He Was the King\", which takes liberties with Elvis's legendary exploits. But does anybody need to be reminded of Elvis's popularity when the same old songs are repackaged every holiday season? Or is that Young's point?</p><p>Still, Prairie Wind is best when Young indulges personal reminiscences, as on \"Far From Home\", which starts with a fond memory: \"When I was a growing boy rockin' on my daddy's knee/ Daddy took an old guitar and sang 'Bury me on the lone prairie.'\" Young's dad appears again on the title track, and a less earthly father appears on \"When God Made Me\". \"This Old Guitar\" reminisces over his long career, and on the album opener, \"The Painter\", he nods to old friends who are either long gone or still hanging around for another album. Several of the musicians on Prairie Wind have played with Young many times before, including keyboard player Spooner Oldham, guitarist Ben Keith, bassist Rick Rosas, and Emmylou Harris. For such a seasoned band, though, they sound maybe a little too familiar: They tend to let the songs drag out, clocking in at five, six, or even seven minutes (the tiring title track) when three would work just fine.</p><p>Intermingled with these private memories are larger concerns about Bush-era America, across which a cold prairie wind apparently blows. Yet Young's music is so rooted in the past, specifically the spirit of the 60s, that his stabs at contemporary relevance sound awkward and even curmudgeonly, as on \"No Wonder\" when he refers to \"America the Beautiful\" as \"that song from 9/11\" and quotes Chris Rock. Prairie Wind tries to gauge the present via the past, but there's a profound disconnect. But maybe Young is aware of it: \"I try to tell the people,\" he sings on the title track, \"But they never hear a word I say/ They say there's nothin' out there but wheat field anyway.\" He sounds pretty frustrated, but Prairie Wind mostly is frustrating.</p><p>&mdash; <strong>Stephen M.

Other than another side project -- the doo wop tribute Cruising With Ruben and the Jets -- Hot Rats was also the first time Zappa focused his efforts in one general area, namely jazz-rock. The result is a classic of the genre. Hot Rats' genius lies in the way it fuses the compositional sophistication of jazz with rock's down-and-dirty attitude -- there's a real looseness and grit to the three lengthy jams, and a surprising, wry elegance to the three shorter, tightly arranged numbers (particularly the sumptuous \"Peaches en Regalia\"). Perhaps the biggest revelation isn't the straightforward presentation, or the intricately shifting instrumental voices in Zappa's arrangements -- it's his own virtuosity on the electric guitar, recorded during extended improvisational workouts for the first time here. His wonderfully scuzzy, distorted tone is an especially good fit on \"Willie the Pimp,\" with its greasy blues riffs and guest vocalist Captain Beefheart's Howlin' Wolf theatrics. Elsewhere, his skill as a melodist was in full flower, whether dominating an entire piece or providing a memorable theme as a jumping-off point. In addition to Underwood, the backing band featured contributions from Jean-Luc Ponty, Lowell George, and Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris, among others; still, Zappa is unquestionably the star of the show. Hot Rats still sizzles; few albums originating on the rock side of jazz-rock fusion flowed so freely between both sides of the equation, or achieved such unwavering excitement and energy.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p><hr/><p>Frank Zappa – guitar, octave bass, percussion</p><p>Ian Underwood – piano, organus maximus, flute, all clarinets, all saxes</p><p>Captain Beefheart – vocals on \"Willie the Pimp\"</p><p>Max Bennett – bass on all tracks except \"Peaches en Regalia\"</p><p>Shuggie Otis – bass on \"Peaches en Regalia\"</p><p>John Guerin – drums on \"Willie the Pimp\", \"Little Umbrellas\" and \"It Must Be a Camel\"</p><p>Paul Humphrey – drums on \"Son of Mr. Green Genes\" and \"The Gumbo Variations\"</p><p>Ron Selico – drums on \"Peaches en Regalia\"</p><p>Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris – violin on \"Willie the Pimp\" and \"The Gumbo Variations\"</p><p>Jean-Luc Ponty – violin on \"It Must Be a Camel\"</p><p>Lowell George – rhythm guitar (uncredited)</p>"

While Weasels Ripped My Flesh focuses on complex material and improvised stage madness, this collection of studio and live recordings summarizes the leader's various interests and influences at the time. It opens and closes on '50s pop covers, \"WPLJ\" and \"Valarie.\" \"Aybe Sea\" is a Zappafied sea shanty, while \"Igor's Boogie\" is named after composer Igor Stravinsky, the closest thing to a hero Zappa ever worshipped. But the best material is represented by \"Holiday in Berlin,\" a theme that would become central to the music of 200 Motels, and \"The Little House I Used to Live In,\" including a virtuoso piano solo by Ian Underwood. Presented as an extended set of theme and variations, the latter does not reach the same heights as \"King Kong.\" In many places, and with the two aforementioned exceptions in mind, Burnt Weeny Sandwich sounds like a set of outtakes from Uncle Meat, which already summarized to an extent the adventures of the early Mothers. It lacks some direction, but those allergic to the group's grunts and free-form playing will prefer it to the wacky Weasels Ripped My Flesh.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>François Couture</strong></p>"

		"review": "<p>Aside from the experimental side project Lumpy Gravy, Hot Rats was the first album Frank Zappa recorded as a solo artist sans the Mothers, though he continued to employ previous musical collaborators, most notably multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood. Other than another side project -- the doo wop tribute Cruising With Ruben and the Jets -- Hot Rats was also the first time Zappa focused his efforts in one general area, namely jazz-rock. The result is a classic of the genre. Hot Rats' genius lies in the way it fuses the compositional sophistication of jazz with rock's down-and-dirty attitude -- there's a real looseness and grit to the three lengthy jams, and a surprising, wry elegance to the three shorter, tightly arranged numbers (particularly the sumptuous \"Peaches en Regalia\"). Perhaps the biggest revelation isn't the straightforward presentation, or the intricately shifting instrumental voices in Zappa's arrangements -- it's his own virtuosity on the electric guitar, recorded during extended improvisational workouts for the first time here. His wonderfully scuzzy, distorted tone is an especially good fit on \"Willie the Pimp,\" with its greasy blues riffs and guest vocalist Captain Beefheart's Howlin' Wolf theatrics. Elsewhere, his skill as a melodist was in full flower, whether dominating an entire piece or providing a memorable theme as a jumping-off point. In addition to Underwood, the backing band featured contributions from Jean-Luc Ponty, Lowell George, and Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris, among others; still, Zappa is unquestionably the star of the show. Hot Rats still sizzles; few albums originating on the rock side of jazz-rock fusion flowed so freely between both sides of the equation, or achieved such unwavering excitement and energy.</p><p>&mdash;<strong>Steve Huey</strong></p><hr/><p>Frank Zappa – guitar, octave bass, percussion</p><p>Ian Underwood – piano, organus maximus, flute, all clarinets, all saxes</p><p>Captain Beefheart – vocals on \"Willie the Pimp\"</p><p>Max Bennett – bass on all tracks except \"Peaches en Regalia\"</p><p>Shuggie Otis – bass on \"Peaches en Regalia\"</p><p>John Guerin – drums on \"Willie the Pimp\", \"Little Umbrellas\" and \"It Must Be a Camel\"</p><p>Paul Humphrey – drums on \"Son of Mr. Green Genes\" and \"The Gumbo Variations\"</p><p>Ron Selico – drums on \"Peaches en Regalia\"</p><p>Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris – violin on \"Willie the Pimp\" and \"The Gumbo Variations\"</p><p>Jean-Luc Ponty – violin on \"It Must Be a Camel\"</p><p>Lowell George – rhythm guitar (uncredited)</p>"
