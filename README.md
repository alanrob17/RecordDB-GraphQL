# RecordDb in GraphQL

Using GraphQL with JavaScript allows developers to create flexible and efficient APIs that enable clients to request exactly the data they need. Hereâ€™s an overview of how to get started with GraphQL in a JavaScript environment, particularly using Node.js and libraries like ``graphql-js`` and Express.

## Overview of GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and powerful alternative to REST. It allows clients to specify the structure of the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### Key Features

**Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema that specifies the types of data available and how they can be queried.

**Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, which often requires multiple endpoints, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint for all queries.

**Client-Specified Queries**: Clients can request exactly what they need, leading to more efficient data retrieval.

## Install packages

```bash
    npm i express
```

.

```bash
    npm i express-graphql
```

.

```bash
    npm i graphql
```

.

```bash
    npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Express GraphQL has been deprecated. You should use this but I can't get it working.

```bash
    npm i graphql-http
```

## Running the server

```bash
    npm run devStart
```

## Queries

Select all Artists and Records.

```bash
query {
  artists {
    id
    firstname
    lastname
    name
    records {
      id
      name
      field
      recorded
	  label
	  pressing
	  rating
	  discs
      media
      bought
      cost
    }
  }
}
```

Returns.

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "artists": [
      {
        "id": 528,
        "firstname": "Mick",
        "lastname": "Abrahams",

Query a single Artist.

          "cost": 10
        },
        {

          "cost": 0
        },
        ...
```

Query a single Record.

```bash
query {
  record(id: 1172) {
    id
    name
    field
    recorded
    label
    pressing
    rating
    discs
    media
    bought
    cost
  }
}
```

Returns.

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "record": {
      "id": 1172,
      "name": "Blonde On Blonde",
      "field": "Rock",
      "recorded": 1966,
      "label": "Columbia",
      "pressing": "Am",
      "rating": "****",
      "discs": 1,
      "media": "CD",
      "bought": "17-02-1999",
      "cost": 14
    }
  }
}
```

Add an Artist

```bash
mutation {
  addArtist(firstname: "Alan", lastname: "Robson", name: "Alan Robson", biography: "Alan is a Country & Western singer.") {
    id
    firstname
    lastname
    name
    biography
  }
}
```

Returns.

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "addArtist": {
      "id": 617,
      "firstname": "Alan",
      "lastname": "Robson",
      "name": "Alan Robson",
      "biography": "Alan is a Country & Western singer."
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** this works but isn't bringing back a correct ``id``.
